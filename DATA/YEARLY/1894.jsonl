(1887) c. 184\u2014Repugnancy.\nThe power given to municipal councils by sec. 495 (3) of the Ontario Municipal Act to pass by-laws for licensing, regulating and governing hawkers, etc., in their respective trades does not authorize the Toronto City Council to prohibit the carrying on of these trades in certain streets. Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nA by-law of the City Council provided that no license should be required from any peddler of fish, farm and garden produce, fruit and coal oil, or other small articles that could be carried in the hand or in a small basket.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting, that a subsequent by-law fixing the amount of a license fee for fish hawkers and peddlers was not void for repugnancy.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[1], refusing to quash secs. 12 (2a) and 43 (2a) of by-law no. 2934 of the City Council of Toronto.\nThe sections of the by-law and the grounds upon which the motion to quash was made sufficiently appear in the judgments of this court. Sec. 12 (2a) prohibited hawkers and petty chapmen from carrying on their business in certain specified streets in Toronto and was claimed to be in restraint of trade and not within the power of the council to pass under sec. 495 subsec. 3 of the Municipal Act. The other section attacked fixed the annual license fee of fish hawkers and peddlers who, it was claimed, were exempt from license by a former by-law, and was attacked on the ground of repugnancy. The motion to quash was made before Galt C.J. who held both sections valid and the Court of Appeal affirmed his decision.\nDuVernet for the appellant. The Municipal Act only authorizes by-laws to license, regulate and govern. It must be construed strictly against the municipality. Reg. v. Smith[2]; In re Borthioick & Corporation of Ottawa[3]; Reg. v. Dowling[4].\nSec. 12 (2a) is in restraint of trade and therefore ultra vires. Chaddock v. Day[5]; Hughes v. Recorder\u2019s Court[6].\nAnd it is, in effect, prohibitory and void on that account. In re Brodie & Corporation of Bowmanville[7]; In re Barclay & Municipality of Darlington[8]; Bannan v. City of Toronto[9].\nA trade lawful in itself cannot be prohibited on the ground of nuisance. Davis v. Municipality of Clifton[10]; Nash v. McCracken[11]; Reg. v. Wood[12]; Calder Navigation Co. v. Pilling[13].\nThat the Council exceeded its powers, see also Reg. v. Justices of Kings[14]; and that the by-law improperly discriminated in favour of shop-keepers Reg. v. Pipe[15]; Reg. v. Flory[16].\nMowat for the respondents. Shop-keepers are favoured in law as against peddlers. Chitty on Commerial law.[17] Confining a business to certain parts of the city is a regulation and not restraint of trade. Maxim Nordenfelt Co., v. Nordenfelt[18].\nAnd see Simson v. Moss[19].\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I think that Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s reasoning in the Court of Appeal amply demonstrates that the by-laws impeached are perfectly legal and intra vires of the corporation.\nIt would require a stronger case than the appellant has, in my opinion, made to bring me to reverse the unanimous judgment of two Ontario courts on the Ontario Municipal Acts.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon the 13th day of January, 1890, the municipal council of the City of Toronto passed a by-law, designated as no. 2453, and intituled:\nA by-law respecting the appointment of a general inspector of licenses, and the issue of licenses in certain cases.\nIt is only with the 12th and 43rd sections of that by-law, as amended by subsequent by-laws, that we are at present concerned. Upon the 23rd day of June, 1890, the same municipal council passed a by-law which, among other things, repealed subsec. 2 of sec. 43 of the by\u2011law no. 2453, and substituted another subsection in lieu thereof. By another by-law passed on the 26th day of October, 1891, the said municipal council further amended sec. 12, and the sec. 43 as amended by the said by-law of the 23rd June, 1890.\nThe sections 12 and 43 of the by-law no. 2453 as so amended, are as follows:\u2014 The municipal council of the city of Toronto enacts as follows:\nSec. 12. Licenses shall be taken out by:\nSubsec. 2. All hawkers, petty chapmen or other persons carrying on petty trades, or who go from place to place or to other men\u2019s houses on foot or with any animal bearing or drawing any goods, wares or merchandise for sale, or in or with any boat, vessel or other craft, or otherwise carry goods, wares or merchandise for sale; except that no such license shall be required for hawking, peddling or selling from any vehicle or other conveyance goods, wares or merchandise to any retail dealer, or for hawking or peddling goods, wares or merchandise the growth, produce or manufacture of this province, not being liquors within the meaning of the law relating to taverns or tavern licenses, if the same are being hawked or peddled by the manufacturer or producer of such goods, wares or merchandise, or by his bon\u00e2 fide servants or employees having written authority in that behalf, and such servant or employee shall produce and exhibit his written authority when required so to do by any municipal or peace officer, nor from any peddler offish, farm and garden produce, fruit and coal oil, or other small articles that can be carried in the hand or in a small basket, nor from any tinker, glazier or harness mender, or any person usually trading or mending kettles, tubs, household goods or umbrellas, or going about and carrying with him proper materials for such mending.\nSubsec. 2a. No person named and specified in subsection 2 of this section, whether a licensee or not, shall, after the 1st day of July, 1892, prosecute his calling or trade in any of the following streets and portions of streets in the city of Toronto: 1. Yonge Street, from the bay to the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks; 2. Queen Street, from Pape Avenue, in St. Matthew\u2019s. Ward, to Jamieson Avenue, in St. Alban\u2019s Ward; 3. King Street, from the river Don to Niagara Street; 4. Spadina Avenue, from King Street to College Street; 5. College Street, from Spadina Avenue to Bathurst Street; 6. Parliament Street, from Queen Street to Westminster Street; 7. Dundas Street, from Queen Street to St. Claren\u2019s Avenue; 8. Wellington Street, from Church Street to York Street.\nSec. 43. There shall be levied and collected from the applicant for every license granted for any object or business in this by-law specified as requiring a license, a license fee, as follows:\nSubsec. 2a. For a license to any one following the calling of a hawker, peddler or petty chapman, with a two-horse vehicle, $40; (2) with a one-horse vehicle, $30; (3) on a street corner or other place where permission is given therefor, other than in a house or shop, $15; (4) on foot, with a hand-barrow or wagon pushed or drawn, $7; (5) with a creel or large basket crate, $2.50; and the general inspector of licenses shall furnish such licensee with a suitable badge, to be worn by said licensee in a conspicuous place while plying his trade.\nSubsec. 2a. Provided that the annual fee for a fish hawker or peddler shall be, with a horse, mule or other animal and vehicle, $10; or (2), on foot, $2.50.\nNow it is to be observed that the above subsection 2a of said section 12 and subsection 2a of said section 43 were introduced into and made part of said by-law no. 2453 by the by-law passed upon the 26th of October 1891, while the subsection 2 of said section 43 was introduced into and made part of said by-law 2453 by the by-law passed on the 23rd day of June, 1890. It is objected to this by-law as thus amended that subsection 2a of said section 12 is wholly void and invalid for the following reasons: 1st. That it is wholly ultra vires of the corporation to pass as constituting an unauthorized and illegal restraint of the common law rights as well as of the statutable rights of persons engaged in carrying on legal, though they be petty, trades, occupations or business, and 2nd as being unreasonable in this that by the by-law as it now stands amended persons carrying on the respective trades for which by the section licenses are required to be taken out, while purported to be deprived by the subsection 2a of said section 12, of the right to carry on their trades in the greater part of the populous and profitable portion of the city for carrying on such trades are by the frame of the by-law as amended required to pay for licenses to carry on their trades in the smaller and least populous and least profitable portion of the city for carrying on their trades the respective fees which were in fact imposed for licenses to carry on their respective trades throughout the entire city.\nSubsection 2a of the section 43 was also objected to as invalid, for the reason that it purports to require fish hawkers to pay license fees while the immediately preceding section 2 of said section 43 enacts and declares that hawkers or peddlers of fish shall not be required to take out any license.\nVery many decided cases both ancient and modern, some more some less and some as it appears not at all bearing and throwing light upon the question before us, have been cited to us upon both sides. In estimating the value of these respective authorities as affecting the present case it is obviously of the first importance that we should carefully observe the terms in which the authority to pass the respective by-laws under consideration in the decided cases is expressed, in the act of Parliament, charter or other instrument by which the authority to pass the respective by-laws was conferred.\nIn Freemantle v. the Company of Silk Throwsters[20] a by-law had been passed by the company that none of that company should run above a certain number of spindles in one week. This was held to be a by-law not in restraint of trade but in restraint of monopoly\u2014that none of the members of the company should engross the whole trade; and so was according to what was convenient and good, and the company having by its charter power to regulate its own trade the by-law was held to be good.\nIn Player v. Jenkins[21] it was held that a by-law made by the corporation of the city of London who by immemorial custom had the ordering of carmen and carters in the city that there should be only 420 allowed, and that if any worked unallowed they should pay 40s. to the chamberlain of the city was a good by-law. The reasoning upon which it was sustained was that the trade or business of carmen and carters was not like other trades for that a great number might cause disturbance and a nuisance in the streets and that therefore the number might be restricted, especially in a city\u2014for there any trade that might be a nuisance might be restrained.\nPlayer v. Vere[22] was a case arising on a by-law passed by the city of London by way of repeal of and substitution for the by-law upon which the above case in 2 Keble proceeded. In this case the custom and the by-law were both specially pleaded at large as follows: The custom was that the mayor, aldermen, &c., from time out of mind, have had and have the right to order and dispose of carts, cars, car-rooms, carters and carmen and of all other persons whatsoever working any cars or carts within the city and liberties according to the custom thereof, which custom was confirmed by Parliament in the 7th year of Ric. II. The by-law then repealed the former by-law on the same subject, and reciting that the trade of the city being seriously considered, and to the end that all the streets and lanes of the city may not be pestered with carts or cars and that His Majesty\u2019s subjects may have free passage by coach or otherwise through the said streets and lanes, it was therefore enacted that no more than 420 carts should be allowed or permitted to work for hire within the city or the liberties thereof, and that each of them should be made known by having the city arms upon the shaft of every such cart in a piece of brass with the number upon it, and that 17s. 4d. per annum and no more should be received and paid for a car-room; and 20s. and no more or greater fine upon any admittance or alienation, of a car-room, which 17s. 4d. per annum and 20s. aforesaid should be wholly applied towards the relief and maintenance of the poor orphans harboured and to be harboured in Christ\u2019s Hospital, and that if any person should presume to work any cars or carts within the said city and liberties for hire by himself or servants not being duly allowed as afore- said, such person for every time of so offending should forfeit and pay the sum of 13s. 4d. to be recovered as provided in the by-law. This by-law was held to be void so far as it related to the fine and rent, but good as to the limitation of the number of cars to be allowed.\nNow it is to be observed that the by-law showed upon its face that it was passed for the maintenance of order and good government in the city and to prevent obstructions and nuisances occurring in the streets.\nIn Wannel v. The City of London[23] it appeared that by the custom of London, time out of mind, the several companies of Freemen of the City of London had power to pass by-laws to regulate their respective trades, and that a by-law had been made by the joiners company, one of the said companies, which reciting that several persons, not free of the joiners company, had exercised the trade of a joiner in an unskilful and fraudulent manner, which could not be redressed whilst such persons were not under the order and regulation of the company, and it was therefore enacted that no person should use the trade who is not free of the company, under the penalty of \u00a310. This was held to be a good by-law, as being made in regulation of the trade by the persons most competent to judge of the necessities of the trade, and to prevent fraud and unskilfulness, of which none but a company carrying on the same trade can be judges.\nIn Bosworth v. Hearne[24] it was held that a by-law passed by the city of London, which by custom, time out of mind, had the regulation of carts in the city, was good, which enacted that no drayman or brewer\u2019s servant should be abroad in the streets with his dray or cart after 1 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, between Michaelmas and Ladyday, and from thence after eleven in the forenoon, under the penalty of 20s., the court was of opinion that such a custom was good, and that as the regulation did not in itself appear to the court to be unreasonable the by-law was good.\nIn The Chamberlain of London v. Godman[25] it was held that a by-law of the city to oblige a person who had a right to be free of the city, to take up his freedom in some particular company, is in restraint of trade and bad, not being shown to be warranted by any special custom; that a general power to make by-laws for the common good of the citizens gave no power to make such a by-law. But in Rex v. Harrison[26] it was held, following Wannel v. The City of London[27], that a by-law that a butcher in London must be free of the butchers\u2019 company, was a good by-law. The court saying that the by-law only restored the constitution to what it originally must have been and ought to be, and that it was right and reasonable, and must have been the meaning of the custom that each company should have the inspection of their own trade. In Pierce v. Bartrum[28], a by-law of the city of Exeter was passed, under a charter granted to the city by Queen Elizabeth, and which enacted that no butcher or other person should, within the walls of the city, slaughter any beast upon pain to forfeit for every beast so slaughtered a fine prescribed by the by-law. It was contended that this by-law was void as being in restraint of a common law right of trade which, it was contended, nothing but a custom could control, and no custom was shown. The answer to this argument was that the by-law was one which merely restrained and prohibited an act being done, which, if done, would be a nuisance at common law, and by statute 4 H. 7 chap. 3, and so the by-law was held to be good as a reasonable regulation of trade. This case simply decides that a by-law which prohibits an act being done by any person in the conduct of his trade, which would plainly constitute a nuisance, cannot in law be said to be in restraint of trade, but rather a reasonable regulation of it. In Chamberlain of the City of London v. Compton[29] it was held that a by-law of the city of London, that no person not being free of the pewterers company should exercise the trade of a pewterer, was a by-law in restraint of trade, and in the absence of a special custom to support it was void.\nThe case of The Gunmakers Society of London v. Fell[30], arose upon a demurrer to the declaration, and it was held that a by-law passed by the gunmakers company that no member should sell the barrel of any handgun ready proved, to any person of the trade not a member, in London or within four miles thereof; and that no member should strike his stamp or mark on the barrel of any person not a member of the company under a penalty of 10s. for each offence, was holden to be in restraint of trade and void, it not appearing from anything set forth in the declaration that there was any adequate reason for these restraints or any consideration to the persons restrained. The charter of the company was set forth in the declaration. The Lord Chief Justice Willes there said:\u2014\nThe general rule is that all restraints of trade if nothing more appear are bad. This is the rule which was laid down in the famous case of Mitchel v. Reynolds[31]. But to this general rule there are some exceptions, as first, that if the restraint be only particular in respect of the time or place, and there be a good consideration given to the person restrained, a contract or agreement upon such consideration so restraining a particular person may be good and valid in law notwithstanding the general rule; and this was the very case of Mitchel v. Reynolds where such a bond was holden to be good. So likewise if the restraint appear to be of a manifest benefit to the public, such a restraint by a by-law or otherwise may be good; for it is to be considered rather as a regulation than a restraint; and it is for the advantage and not the detriment of trade that proper regulations should be made in it.\nIn Maxim Nordenfelt Gun Co. v. Nordenfelt[32], the Court of Appeal in England review all the cases of contracts in any way in restrant of trade from Mitchel v. Reynolds[33] down to the present time, and show the course of the decisions from time to time leading to the developments the doctrine as at present held in England. After a masterly review of the cases Lord Justice Lindley says[34]:\u2014\nIn Rousillon v. Rousillon[35], Lord Justice Fry in one of those admirable judgments for which he was so justly celebrated, came to the conclusion that the only test by which to determine the validity or invalidity of a covenant in restraint of trade given for valuable consideration was its reasonableness for the protection of the trade or business of the covenantee. This accords with the view of Lord Justice James in Leather Cloth Co. v. Lorsont[36], and is in my opinion the doctrine to which modern authorities have been gradually approximating. But I cannot regard it as finally settled nor indeed as quite correct. The doctrine ignores the law which forbids monopolies and prevents a person from unrestrictedly binding himself not to earn his living in the best way he can. Our predecessors expressed their views on this subject by drawing a distinction between partial and general restraint of trade and the distinction cannot be ignored. But what is more important than nomenclature or classification is the principle which underlies both.\nAnd Lord Justice Bowen after a like review of the cases sums up the result to be as follows[37]:\nGeneral restraints or in other words restraints wholly unlimited in area are not as a rule permitted by the law although the rule admits of exceptions. Partial restraints or in other words restraints which involve only a limit of places at which, of persons with whom, or of modes in which the trade is to be carried on are valid when made for a good consideration and where they do not extend further than is necessary for the reasonable protection of the covenantee.\nNow the rule laid down governing the determination of cases in relation to contracts in restraint to trade can have application in the determination of a case like the present of a by-law passed by a municipal corporation incorporated by act of Parliament and imposing partial restraints upon the exercise of their trades by persons engaged therein, only upon the principle that what is necessary to support a contract in partial restraint of trade is equally necessary to support the by-law of a municipal corporation imposing partial restraints in the exercise of their trades by persons engaged therein, and that such a by-law is bad (as was held in respect of the by-law under consideration in the case of The Gun Makers Co. v. Fell), unless it be made to appear that there were adequate reasons for making the by-law and sufficient consideration to the persons restrained. Unless it be made so to appear it is impossible for the court, whose duty it is (equally as upon a question of reasonable and probable cause arising in an action on the case) to determine as a point of law whether the by-law is reasonable or not, efficiently to discharge its functions. But in the case of a by-law in restraint of trade passed by a municipal corporation there is this difference to be considered, namely, that whereas any individual has power to enter into any contract affecting his own interests and trade not contravening the rules of law applicable to such a contract no municipal, or other corporation incorporated by act of Parliament can have any power whatever to pass a by-law in restraint of trade partial or otherwise unless specially empowered so to do by suitable language in that behalf in an act of Parliament, and in construing an act of Parliament relied upon as conferring the power we must look to the purposes for which the corporation was created and gather the intent of the legislature as to conferring power to make a by-law of the character of the particular one under consideration from a consideration of all clauses of the act affecting the subject and not of one isolated clause only, and in so doing we must enquire and consider whether the by-law under consideration does relate to and advance any and if any what purpose for which the corporation was created. Thus in the Calder Navigation Co. v. Pilling[38] a question arose as to the validity of a by-law passed by the Navigation Company which enacted that the navigation should be closed on every Sunday throughout the year and that no business should be transacted thereon during such time (works of necessity only excepted), nor should any person during such time navigate any boat, &c., nor should any boat, & c., pass along any part of the said navigation on any Sunday except for a reasonable distance for the purpose of mooring the same, and except on some extraordinary necessity or for the purpose of going to or returning from any place of divine worship under a penalty of \u00a35.\nAlderson B., pronouncing judgment, said:\nThe only question in this case is whether this by-law be good or not. For the purpose of determining that we must look to the powers to make by-laws given by the legislature to this company, in order to see whether this by-law is within the scope of their authority, or whether it does not relate to matters which ought to be left to the general law of the land by which the general conduct of the Queen\u2019s subjects is regulated. The power of making by-laws is conferred upon the company by a local act, by which it is enacted that the company shall have power and authority to make such new rules, by-laws and constitutions, for the good government of the said company and for the good and orderly using the said navigation, and all warehouses, wharfs, passages, locks and other things that shall be made for the same, and of and concerning all such vessels, goods and commodities as shall be navigated and conveyed thereon, and also for the well governing of the bargemen, watermen and boatmen who shall carry any goods, wares or merchandise upon any part of the said navigation. Now, looking at these words, it appears to me that all the powers which the legislature intended to give this company with respect to making laws for the government of this navigation, was solely for the orderly use of the navigation, that is to say, to regulate in what manner and order th navigation should be used so as to secure to the public the greatest convenience in the use of it.\nAnd Rolfe B., in his judgment, says[39]:\nThe legislature says to the company, you may make by-laws for the good and orderly navigation of the canal, and for the government of the boatmen and bargemen connected with it, that is to say, in order that the navigation may be used with the utmost degree of convenience to every person. Now, the only point which occurred to me was this: whether on a state of facts, properly alleged, a by-law like this might not, under peculiar circumstances, be held good. Suppose, for instance, the company were to come to the conclusion that in order to secure a due supply of water in the canal it was necessary to have no navigation on it during one day out of seven, perhaps they would have power to close the canal for one day out of seven in order to make the navigation good during the other six, and in that case to say: if this must be done, we will take Sunday as the fittest day.\nThe by-law was held to be wholly ultra vires of the corporation, Chief Baron Pollock and Platt B. concurring.\nNow it is here to be observed that for the purpose of construing the language used by the legislature as to conferring power upon the company to pass by-laws for the good government of the company and for the well governing of the bargemen, watermen and boatmen, and of and concerning the vessels, &c., that should be navigated thereon; and in order to arrive at the true intent of the legislature as to the powers conferred by such language the court had regard to the purpose for which the corporation was created, namely, for the good and orderly navigation of the canal.\nThen there are three cases of by-laws of municipal corporations incorporated by the English municipal corporations acts viz. Everett v. Grapes[40], wherein a by-law passed by the town council of the borough of New Port in the Isle of Wight in conformity with all the formalities prescribed by 5 & 6 Wm. IV., ch 76, and duly allowed under the provisions of the statute in that behalf by Her Majesty in Council, was in the following terms:\u2014\nEvery person who shall keep or suffer to be kept any swine within the said borough from the 1st day of May to the 31st day of October inclusive, in any year, shall for every such offence forfeit and pay the sum of 5s. and the further sum of 2s. 6d. for every day the same shall continue.\nThe section of the act 5 & 6 Wm. IV., ch. 76 sec. 90, in virtue of which the by-law was passed, enacted that:\nIt shall be lawful for the council of any borough to make such by-laws as to them shall seem meet for the good government of the borough, and for the prevention and suppression of all such nuisances as are not already punishable in a summary manner by virtue of any Act in force throughout such borough and to appoint by such by-laws such fines as they shall deem necessary for the prevention and suppression of such offences.\nUpon a conviction under that by-law it was set aside upon the ground that the by-law was ultra vires of the corporation to pass. The contention in support of the by-law was that it was not in restraint of but merely in regulation of trade, but the court held the by-law void as in restraint of trade, holding that all by-laws which restrict the common law right of trading always have the qualification annexed (to be good) that the trade is conducted so as to be a nuisance.\nSo in Johnson v. Mayor of Croydon[41], where by a by-law passed by the town council of the borough of Croydon under the powers conferred by 45 & 46 Vic., ch. 50, sec. 23, which is identical in its terms with sec. 90 of 5 & 6 Wm. IV., ch. 76, it was enacted that no person not being a member of Her Majesty\u2019s army or auxiliary forces acting under the commands of his commanding officers should sound, or play upon, any musical instrument in any of the streets of the borough on Sunday, and after a conviction had under this by- law it was held to be void as unreasonable and ultra vires, as it made playing a musical instrument an offence whether it caused a nuisance, or annoyed any body, or not.\nSo likewise in Munro v. Watson[42], where a by-law was passed by the town council of the borough of Ryde, under the authority of sec. 90 of 5 & 6 Wm. IV., ch. 76, whereby it was enacted that every person who in any street should sound, or play upon, any musical or noisy, instrument, or should sing, recite or preach in any street without having previously obtained a license in writing from the mayor, and every person who having obtained such license should fail to observe or should act contrary to any of the conditions of such license should forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding twenty shillings, nor less than one shilling, it was held that this by-law was ultra vires of the town council to pass as it professed to suppress what unless done in such a manner as to constitute a nuisance was upon the principles of the common law perfectly lawful. These cases seem to establish the principle that the municipal corporations in England created by act of Parliament, although being invested with most ample powers to pass all by-laws necessary for the good government of the municipality, have no authority to pass a by-law in restraint of the performance of any act by the inhabitants which in itself is lawful at common law, unless it be so done as to create a nuisance, or to impose any restraint partial or otherwise upon the exercise of any trade, unless either the trade restrained be in itself a nuisance or that not being in itself a nuisance is made a nuisance by the manner in which it is carried on.\nIt only remains therefore to consider whether the Municipal Institutions Act of Ontario, ch. 184 of the Revised Statutes, gives authority to the council of the municipality of the city of Toronto to pass the subsections of the by-law now under consideration.\nThe 283rd. section of the act invests the council with the most ample power to pass all such by-laws or regulations as the good of the inhabitants of the municipality requires. The 285th section enacts that in all cases where the councils are authorized by the act or by any other act to pass by-laws for licensing any trade, calling, &c., &c., or the persons carrying on or engaged in any such trade, calling, &c., they shall have power to pass by-laws for fixing the sum to be paid for such license and enforcing the payment thereof. By section 489, subsection 41, they are empowered to pass by-laws for preventing and abating public nuisances, and by section 495, which is the only section which has been appealed to by the respondents in support of the subsections of the by-law under consideration which are impugned, they are empowered to pass by-laws for the following purposes among others:\u2014\nSec. 495, subsection 2. For licensing, regulating and governing auctioneers and other persons selling and putting up for sale goods, wares, merchandise or effects by public auction, and for fixing the sum to be paid for every such license, and the time it shall be in force.\nSubsection 3. For licensing, regulating and governing hawkers or petty chapmen and other persons carrying on petty trades or who go from place to place or to other men\u2019s houses on foot or with any animal bearing or drawing any goods wares or merchandise for sale or in or with any boat, vessel or other craft, or otherwise, carrying goods, wares or merchandise for sale and for fixing the sum to be paid for a license for exercising such calling within the county, city, &c., and the time the license shall be in force. Provided always that no such license shall be required for hawking peddling or selling from any vehicle or other conveyance any goods wares or merchandise to any retail dealer, or for hawking or peddling any goods wares or merchandize, the growth produce or manufacture of this province not being liquors, &c., &c., if the same are being hawked or peddled by the manufacturer or producer of such goods wares or merchandise or by his bon\u00e2 fide servants or employees having written authority on that behalf; and provided also that nothing herein contained shall affect the powers of any council to pass by-laws under the provisions of section 496 of this act.\nNow the only clause of this section 496 which can be said to come within this proviso are subsections 27, and 36 of the section 496 by which the council of every city, &c., &c., are empowered to pass by-laws:\nSubsection 27. For regulating or preventing the encumbering, injuring or fouling by animals, vehicles, vessels or other means of any road, street, square, alley, lane, bridge or other communication.\nSubsection 36. For regulating the conveyance of traffic in the public streets and the width of the tires and wheels of all vehicles used for the conveyance of articles of burden, goods, wares or merchandise and for prohibiting heavy traffic and the driving of cattle, sheep, pigs and other animals on certain public streets named in the by-law.\nThe plain, and indeed the only, meaning which can be given to the second proviso to the third subsection of section 495 of the act is that nothing contained in the immediately preceding proviso to the same subsection, recognizing and affirming and confirming the common law right of all persons to hawk, peddle and sell from any vehicle or other conveyance goods, wares and merchandise to any retail dealer within the limits of the city, and the right of all manufacturers and producers of goods manufactured and produced by them within the province, to hawk and peddle such goods within the city of Toronto, without any license therefor from the city, should be construed to interfere in any respect with the right of the city council to pass by-laws in respect of the matters contained in subsections 27 and 36 of section 496. All the persons named in the first proviso of section 495 are, if the subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law under consideration be good, deprived of their right to carry on within the prohibited streets constituting a very large portion of the city of Toronto, their trades and callings, their right to carry on which in the entire city is recognized, affirmed and confirmed to them by the proviso. To hold the by-law to be valid as affecting those persons would be to enable the council of the city, by a by-law, to override and nullify rights confirmed by the act and by the very section of the act which is appealed to by the corporation as its authority for making the enactment in the by-law under consideration. As to those persons therefore who are named in the first proviso to sub-section 3 of section 495 as being entitled to carry on the business of hawkers, etc., without a license, the impugned subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law is clearly ultra vires and invalid. But it is equally so, in my opinion, as affecting hawkers, peddlers and petty chapmen requiring licenses to pursue their calling:\nFor, 1st. It is to be observed that the power to pass by-laws for licensing, regulating and governing hawkers, petty chapmen, etc., is given in precisely the same language as is used in the previous subsection, empowering the councils to pass by-laws \u201cfor licensing, regulating and governing auctioneers and other persons putting up goods for sale by auction.\u201d While all are subject to by-laws passed by the council of the municipality to prevent nuisances, all, that is to say, auctioneers, hawkers and petty chapmen as to any power in the municipal councils to impose any restraint upon them, partial or otherwise, in the exercise of their respective callings, are placed precisely on the same footing, so that if the enactment in subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law under consideration were made in relation to auctioneers, and as so made should be unreasonable or ultra vires and invalid, it must be equally so as respects hawkers and petty chapmen, and I must say it seems to me impossible to conceive any reason whatever sufficient to support a by-law imposing such a restraint upon the business of auctioneers. 2nd. From several sections in the act it is apparent that the legislature recognized the great difference which (as said by Harrison C.J. in Reg. v. Johnston,[43]) exists between the regulation and the prohibition or prevention of a trade, and from the language of those sections it is apparent that the legislature by the authority conferred upon municipal councils to pass by-laws for licensing, regulating and governing persons engaged in carrying on the trades of auctioneers, hawkers, peddlers and petty chapmen, never intended to authorize by-laws imposing such restraint upon any of them, in the exercise of their respective trades, as is purported to be imposed by the impugned subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law under consideration.\nThus subsection 3 of section 503 which authorizes municipal councils to pass by-laws for establishing markets expressly enacts that they may pass by-laws \u201cfor preventing or regulating the sale by retail on the public streets or vacant lots adjacent to the market of any meat, vegetables, grain, hay, fruit, beverages, small ware and other articles offered for sale\u201d and by subsection 4 also for preventing vendors of small ware (that is to say petty chapmen), from practising their calling in the market place, or in the public streets and vacant lots adjacent to the market. Now if the impugned subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law under consideration be good this special provision in section 503 for prevention of sales in certain cases and in particular streets adjacent to the markets would have been wholly unnecessary. Indeed the power of prevention here given being specially confined to streets in the neighbourhood of markets affords the strongest possible argument that the right asserted over the numerous streets mentioned in the impugned subsection 2a of section 12 is not conferred upon the plain principle that expressio unius est exclusio alterius. So likewise by sec- tion 489 councils are authorized to pass by-laws by subsection 25, \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d and licensing exhibitions of wax works, menageries, &c. &c., and by subsection 44 \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d the erection or continuance of slaughter houses, gas works, tanneries, distilleries or other manufactories or trades which may prove to be nuisances, and by subsection 45 \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d the keeping of cows, goats, pigs and other animals and defining limits within which the same may be kept, and by subsection 46 \u201cfor regulating or preventing\u201d the ringing of bells blowing of horns, shouting and other unusual noises, or noises calculated to disturb the inhabitants. And so likewise by section 496 subsection 3 \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d the firing of guns or other fire-arms and the firing or setting off of fire balls, squibs, crackers or fire works, and for preventing charivaries and other like disturbances of the peace, and by subsection 13 \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d the use of fire or lights in stables, cabinet makers\u2019 shops, carpenters\u2019 shops and combustible places, and by subsection 14 \u201cfor preventing or regulating\u201d the carrying on of manufactories or trades dangerous in causing or promoting fire. Now that the enactment under consideration in the said subsection 2a of section 12 is not an enactment for the prevention of any nuisance cannot admit of a doubt, for it prohibits absolutely all hawkers and petty chapmen from carrying on their trades in any of the streets named even though in the most orderly and unexceptionable manner possible. Neither can it admit of a doubt that it is an enactment which imposes restraint upon the exercise of the trade or calling of hawkers, petty chapmen, &c., nor are they the only persons prejudiced by such restraint, but the retail dealers also in the prohibited streets who have a right to look to hawkers and petty chapmen for such supplies as they think fit to buy from them, a right expressly secured to them by this ch. 184 section 495 itself, but householders also especially of the poorer class who more than the richer classes are accustomed to look to hawkers and petty chapmen to supply their wants and who might be much prejudiced by being prevented from so supplying themselves with vegetables, fruits and such like perishable articles and with other articles of prime necessity such as coal oil and the services of itinerant menders of kettles, tubs and other household goods, and for this prejudice to all these persons no reason whatever is suggested unless it be the reason given by the corporation under the item no. 5 of their printed reasons in support of their power to make the enactment in question, namely, that:\u2014\nPermanent shopkeepers who pay taxes on real property, and who are supposed to have more stake in the community, are favoured in law as against peddlers, because they are of more use to trade and the community.\nAnd in support of this, as a sufficient reason in support of the enactment, we are referred to Burns, Justice of the Peace[44], where no doubt it is said that:\nThe trade carried on by persons keeping fixed establishments is, generally speaking, much more beneficial to the state than that of itinerant hawkers and peddlers, the character of the local trader is better known, and therefore there is greater security for the respectability of his dealings. He contributes also by the number of persons he employs and the taxes he pays, much more than the itinerant trader, to promote the wealth and increase the prosperity of the country. Hence has arisen the expediency of framing laws which may operate as a restraint upon itinerant traders, may diminish their numbers, and while they prevent any illegal practices, may, by obliging such persons to take out licenses and to submit to certain other regulations, be productive of revenue and profit.\nGranting all this to be true, they are still entitled to the protection of the law in carrying on their humble trade equally as all other traders so long as they com- ply with the law. And the question simply is, as it was in The Calder Navigation Company v. Pilling[45], and in all other cases wherein a question as to the validity of a by-law has arisen, namely, whether the particular enactment which is questioned is within the authority conferred upon the municipal council of the city of Toronto by the chap. 184 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, or whether the subject matter with which the enactment in question assumes to deal is not a matter which ought to be left, and which doth by law appertain, to the general law of the land by which the general conduct of the Queen\u2019s subjects is regulated, and the answer to this question, in my opinion, must be that the municipal council of the city of Toronto had no authority whatever to enact the matter contained in subsection 2a of section 12 of the by-law under consideration, and upon the principle involved in all the cases above cited, and upon a true construction of chap. 184 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario that subsection is unreasonable, ultra vires and invalid. The cases of Barclay v. Darlington[46]; Davis v. Municipality of Clifton[47]; Regina v. Johnston[48]; and Brodie v. Bowmanville[49], are cases in the Upper Canada and Ontario courts which support the view I have taken. The observation of the late Chief Justice Wilson in In re Kiely[50], that the power to regulate livery stables confers the power to declare in what locality or localities they shall be allowed, is merely a dictum of that learned judge that the power to regulate will include a power to prohibit. Livery stables being kept in places where, or in a manner in which they would be nuisances, may be admitted, but the question whether the power to regulate would confer the power to prohibit any livery stable being kept in any of the streets named in the subsection of the by-law under consideration, and within which hawkers and petty chapmen are prohibited from pursuing their calling, is a question which I cannot think was present to the learned judge\u2019s mind when he gave expression to the dictum in question; such a question must be determined by reference to the same authorities as I have cited in connection with the language and intent of the legislature in passing the chap. 184 R.S.O., with which I have dealt.\nNow as to subsection 2 (a) of sec. 43, the by-law as affects the point now under consideration in short substance reads as follows:\u2014\nSec. 12. Licenses must be taken out by, all hawkers, petty chapmen &c., except that no license shall be required 1st for hawking or selling from any vehicle, goods, wares or merchandize to any retail dealer.\u2014Nor 2nd from any peddler of fish, farm and garden produce, tinker, cooper, &c., &c., &c. Then sec. 43 say:\u2014There shall be levied and collected from the applicant for every license granted for any object or business in this by-law specified as requiring a license, a license fee as follows:\u2014Subsection 2. For a license to any one following the calling of a hawker, peddler or petty chapman, with a two horse vehicle $40.00 (2) with a one horse vehicle $30.00; (3) on a street corner or other place where permission is given therefor other than in a house or shop $15.00; (4) on foot with a hand barrow or waggon pushed or drawn $7.50; (5) with a creel or large basket crate $2.50.\nSubsection 2 (a). Provided that the annual fee for a fish hawker or peddler shall be, (1) with a horse, mule or other animal and vehicle $10, or (2) on foot $2.50.\nNow the words \u201cgoods wares and merchandise\u201d in the first exception which all hawkers, &c., &c., are at liberty to hawk and sell from vehicles to retail dealers without requiring a license, are sufficiently large to include fish. But these persons, it is admitted, by the corporation are not required to pay the fee of $10 prescribed by subsec. 2 (a) of sec. 43 to be paid by hawkers of fish with a horse and vehicle, because that the by- law in its 43rd sec. enacts that license fees shall be paid only by the persons who are by the by-law required to take out licenses; and as the above persons named in the first exception in subsec. 2 of sec. 12, are not required by the by-law to take out licenses, the subsec. 2 (a) of sec. 43 cannot apply to them. But for the same reason and upon the same principle, as by the second exception in the same subsec. 2 of sec. 12, the by-law enacts that hawkers and peddlers of fish shall not be required to take out a license, the subsec. 2 (a), of sec. 43 cannot apply to them, and further, it is to be observed that by subsec. 2 of sec. 43, all persons, hawking, peddling, &c, with a two-horse vehicle are required to pay $40, and with a one horse vehicle $30, and on foot with a crate or basket $2.50. So that the persons respectively paying the said sums of $30 and $2.50 had by the provisions of subsec. 2 of sec. 43 a perfect right to sell fish without being obliged to pay any further fee. Now the contention is that subsec. 2 (a) of sec. 43, being subsequent in order to subsec. 2 of sec. 12 and to subsec. 2 of sec. 43, although in the same by-law, must be read not only as repealing the exception of peddlers of fish from subsec. 2 of sect 12, but further as enacting that the persons licensed as hawkers and petty chapmen under subsec. 2 of sec. 43, and paying the fees there provided, shall not be entitled to hawk and sell fish unless by paying the additional sum required by and specified in subsec. 2 (a) of the sec. 43. I find it difficult to concur in this mode of construing an instrument to which over the persons it affects the same force is given as to an act of Parliament, and which, therefore, should be passed with some care and accuracy of expression and certainty as to the persons to be affected by it especially in cases where restrictions and burthens are imposed upon the people in the exercise of their common law rights and the pursuit of their lawful trades and callings, and as the subsection in question purports to deprive persons of rights which they already possessed, it should be read strictly. I think, therefore, that this subsection cannot be read and construed as suggested, but that it should be pronounced to be ultra vires and void as purporting to impose a burden upon peddlers of fish to pay a fee to entitle them to pursue, while they are by the by-law exempted from requiring a license for that purpose, and because if such license were required the fee prescribed by subsec. 2 of sec. 43 covers the right to hawk fish as well as all other articles. The appeal therefore must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and an order be directed to be issued for quashing the two subsections, namely, subsec. 2 (a) of sec. 12 and subsec 2 (a) of sec. 43, of the by-law under consideration, viz. the by-law of the city of Toronto, no. 2453 as amended.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred.\nKING J.\u2014The question in this appeal is as to the validity of certain by-laws of the city of Toronto relating to peddlers, petty chapmen, and other like persons. The Municipality Act of Ontario section 495 (3) empowers the council of any county, city and town separated from the county for municipal purposes to make by-laws:\u2014\nFor licensing, regulating and governing hawkers or petty chapmen and other persons carrying on petty trades or who go from place to place or to other men\u2019s houses on foot or with any animal bearing or drawing any goods, wares or merchandise for sale, or in or with any boat, vessel or other craft or otherwise carrying goods, wares or merchandise for sale, and for fixing the sum to be paid for a license for exercising such calling within the county, city or town and the time the license shall be in force. * * * Provided always that no such licenses shall be required for hawking, peddling or selling from any vehicle or other conveyance any goods, wares or merchandise to any retail dealer, or for hawking or peddling any goods, wares or merchandise, the growth produce or manufacture of this province (not being liquors within the meaning of the law relating to taverns or taverns licenses) if the same are being hawked or peddled by the manufacturer or producer of such goods, wares or merchandise, or by his bon\u00e2 fide servants or employees, having written authority in that behalf.\nBy a by-law no. 2453, passed by the municipal council of the corporation of the city of Toronto on 13th January, 1890, it was ordained that licenses should be taken out by \u201call hawkers, petty chapmen or other persons carrying on petty trades\u201d (following the language of the act) excepting however those whom the act excepted, and further excepting:\u2014\nPeddlers of fish, farm and garden produce, fruit and coal oil, or other small articles that can be carried in the hand or in a small basket also tinkers, coopers, glaziers, harness menders and persons usually trading in or mending kettles, tubs, household goods or umbrellas, and persons going about and carrying with them proper materials for such mending.\nOn 26th October, 1891, a by-law no. 2934 was passed in amendment of the above by the addition of the following:\u2014\nNo person named and specified in subsection 2 of this section\u2014i.e. in the subsection already cited\u2014(whether a licensee or not) shall after the 1st day of July, 1892, prosecute his calling or trade in any of the following streets and portions of streets in the city of Toronto.\nThen follows an enumeration of streets and parts of streets which, it is said on argument, comprise the leading business streets of Toronto, and covers an extent of about ten miles.\nAn application to quash this latter by-law was dismissed by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and his decision was sustained by the Court of Appeal.\nThe business of hawkers, petty chapmen and other persons carrying on petty trades, who go from place to place, and to other men\u2019s houses carrying goods for sale, is a business that is carried on and prosecuted upon and in the streets. The legislature recognized it as a legitimate business, and contemplated that it might be carried on in accordance with what might be considered the natural right to carry on any lawful trade or business, but provided that it might be subjected to being licensed, regulated and governed by the municipal council through by-laws. But, by a proviso, the legislature declared that the business, or certain forms of it, might be carried on in a certain way without being hampered by license fees, or by the obligation to take out a license, with all that is implied in this. Thus any hawker, peddler, etc., is not to be required to procure a license for hawking, peddling, etc., from any vehicle or other conveyance any goods, wares or merchandise to any retail dealer, or for hawking or peddling any goods, wares or merchandise, the growth, produce or manufacture of the province, if the same is being hawked or peddled by the manufacturer or producer of such goods, etc., or by his bon\u00e2 fide servant or employee. It seems to me that this privilege of selling to any retail dealer without license is rendered in large degree nugatory (and entirely so, so far as regards, retail dealers whose places of business are on the prohibited streets) if the city council can prohibit the hawker, etc., from selling at all to such retail dealers. Can it be reasonably concluded that the legislature intended that the council might restrain all selling to retail dealers in large sections of the city, when it in terms declined to subject them to the comparatively small restriction involved in the obtaining and paying for a license in respect of such class of sales? The necessary effect of the by-law is to substantially impair rights and privileges recognized by the statute.\nSo as to the right or privilege to sell free from license to any one goods, etc., the produce or manufacture of the seller, provided they are produced or manufactured\n[Para 475]\nin Ontario. Is it consistent with this that all sale of such articles to any one in the large prohibited district of this by-law, or in any district or street whatever which the council are not empowered by this or some other clause of the Municipal Act to close to such or like traffic, shall be prohibited entirely? The prohibition is not limited to certain times for the promotion of an assumed or real public convenience in the use of the streets, or to regulate traffic therein, nor to certain articles referred to in section 497 subsec. 9, but is general as to the goods, and absolute in its terms, and covers the whole period of each day and of every day in the year. This is very different from regulations as to time or mode. It is said to be merely a regulation as to place, but the business which the legislature has said shall be kept free from the necessity of license is a business which is carried on by going from place to place and to other men\u2019s houses, and to exclude ten miles of populated city streets from the field of these people\u2019s operations, must seriously interfere both with their right freely to sell to retail dealers, and with the right freely to sell to any one goods, their own produce or manufacture, in the only way in which they can so sell.\nUnder sec. 493 subsec. 1 authorizing the council \u201cto license and regulate plumbers,\u201d can it possibly be that these may be restrained, as by way of regulation, from exercising their calling in and over a particular section of the city?\nIn Slattery v. Naylor[51] it was held that in certain cases mere words of regulation may authorize prohibition and the taking away of private property, but this follows upon the consideration that otherwise the matter cannot, in common understanding, be efficiently regulated. It was a case where a municipal act em- powered the council to make by-laws for regulating the interment of the dead, and the by-law prohibited interment altogether in cemeteries situated within a certain distance of any dwelling, place of worship, etc., the effect of which was to destroy, without compensation, the private property of owners of burial places therein.\nLord Hobhouse says[52]:\nIt is difficult to see how the council can make efficient by-laws for such objects as preventing fires, preventing and regulating places of amusement, regulating the killing of cattle and sale of butchers\u2019 meat, preventing bathing, providing for the general health, not to mention others, unless they have substantial powers of restraining people, both in their freedom of action and in their enjoyment of property. The interment of the dead is just one of those affairs in which it would be likely to occur that no regulation would meet the case, except one which wholly prevented the desired or accustomed use of the property.\nThe case also contains observations upon the setting aside of by-laws on the ground of their unreasonableness.\nThe regulating and governing of the business of hawkers does not, one would think, require that they be prohibited from carrying on their business in certain streets, which by the legislature are not authorized to be closed streets to such business and traffic, and which it is not suggested that the act anywhere gives the council authority to treat differently from the streets in general of the city, so far at least as this or like business is concerned. It was said that the business is objectionable by reason of the street cries used in carrying it on. Then the by-law should have been directed against this.\nIn addition to objections suggested by the words of the act I think that the by-law is in restraint of trade; in terms it is so. It says that the persons shall not carry on their trade in the streets named. It is true that all carrying on of the trade is not prohibited, but all carrying on of the trade in large areas is prohibited. It is a partial restraint of trade. As a general principle all by-laws in restraint of trade, general or partial, must be reasonable and beneficial to the public or they cannot be supported. Gun\u2011makers Co. v. Fell[53]; Bosworth v. Hearne[54]. The securing of any public benefit which the council are authorized to promote is strikingly absent from anything that appears likely to follow upon the enforcement of this by-law. In fact, what strikes one as not pleasant in this case is that the rights of these small people over a large part of their accustomed fields of labour are seriously affected, and that so far the respondents have condescended to give no consideration of public benefit for it. It was put as if the council were not to be called on to give reasons.\nThere is another point. It was suggested that the by-law might be sustained under the powers relating to markets. But while the council are by section 503 subsecs. 3 and 4 authorized to pass by-laws \u201cfor preventing or regulating the sale by retail in the public streets or vacant lots adjacent thereto of any meat, vegetables, grain, hay, fruit, beverages, small ware and other articles offered for sale and for regulating the place and manner of selling and weighing grain, meat, vegetables, fish, hay, straw, fodder, wood, lumber, shingles, farm produce of every description, small wares and all other articles exposed for sale and the fees to be paid therefor; and also for preventing criers and vendors of small ware from practising their calling in the market place, public streets and vacant lots adjacent thereto,\u2019\u2019 the restriction as to hawkers, etc., is limited to the market place, and public streets and vacant lots adjacent thereto. This not only does not authorize the by- law in question with its prohibition against selling on many other streets, but seems to show that it is ultr\u00e2 vires, for when the legislature would, as in this case, prevent hawkers selling on certain streets it does so in terms.\nAs to the other by-law complained of, no. 2934 (2a) in amendment of section 43 of no. 2453, as amended by no. 2717, I agree with the observations of Mr. Justice Maclennan, and think that although these by-laws may not be easy to construe it is a matter of construction, and that the by-law referred to in this objection should be allowed to stand. The result, in my opinion, is that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed as to by-law no. 2453 sec. 12 (2a) but reversed as to by-law no. 2453 sec. 43 (2a).\nAppeal allowed as to by-law no. 2453 section 12 (2a) and affirmed as to section 43 (2a).\nSolicitors for appellant: Du Vernet & Jones.\nSolicitor for respondents: C.R.W.

The plaintiff held a note made by Hogan which Hallett & Jackson had indorsed as security for payment. Subsequently, Hogan having failed to pay his said creditors as agreed his business was sold to a third party, and both creditors accepted such third party as debtor in place of Hogan, and plaintiff agreed to give him time to pay off Hogan\u2019s debt. It was under these circumstances that the action was brought on the note against Hogan as maker, and Jackson & Hallett as indorsers. On the trial the action as against Hogan was dismissed, but judgment was given as against the other defendants. The Chancery Division affirmed the judgment of the trial judge. Jackson & Hallett then appealed to the Court of Appeal where the judgment against them was reversed. Plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nJohnson Q.C., for the appellant, referred to Wyke v. Rogers[3]; Ludwig v. Iglehart[4].\nMoss Q.C. for the respondents.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favour of dismissing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s action was rightly dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Osler and of Mr. Justice Maclennan, shows, in my opinion, that no other conclusion is possible. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe evidence clearly established and the learned trial judge found that the plaintiff agreed to accept and did accept Singular as his debtor in lieu of Hogan as well in respect of the debt secured by the promissory note upon which Jackson and Hallett were indorsers as of a further sum secured by a chattel mortgage executed by Hogan to the plaintiff upon chattels in the Victoria Hotel which chattels and his interest in the hotel Hogan sold to Singular leaving $1,247 of the purchase money agreed upon on such sale in Singular\u2019s hands for the express purpose of his paying the plaintiff the two debts due by Hogan on the promissory note and the chattel mortgage. This purchase so made by Singular from Hogan having been communicated to the plaintiff he accepted Singular as his debtor in lieu of Hogan and at Singular\u2019s I request agreed to give him time for payment of the above sums for one or two years or as long as he, Singular, wished, he paying 5 per cent for such accommodation, to which Singular agreed. In fact the evidence clearly shows that the substitution of Singular in the place of Hogan as the keeper of the hotel, which the plaintiff, he being a brewer, supplied with beer and ale, was a step most acceptable to the plaintiff; accordingly the learned judge held that Hogan was discharged from all liability upon the note, from which judgment there has been no appeal taken; the plaintiff, in fact, admits it to be correct; but Hogan\u2019s discharge being due to the fact that the plaintiff had accepted Singular as his debtor in lieu of Hogan in respect of the said sum of $1,247, which included the note sued upon, that transaction constituted a complete novation of Hogan\u2019s debt secured by the note and an absolute release of Hogan in respect of that debt; and the sureties, the indorsers also, became discharged, the debt for which they had become sureties by their indorsement of the note being extinguished\u2014Commercial Bank of Tasmania v. Jones[5]. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Kenneth McLean.\nSolicitor for respondents: T.P.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTitle to lands in railway belt in British Columbia\u2014Unsurveyed lands held under pre-emption record prior to statutory conveyance to Dominion Government\u2014Federal and provincial rights\u2014British Columbia Lands Acts of 1873 and 1879\u201447 Vic., ch. 6 (D).\nOn 10th Sept., 1883, D. et al. obtained a certificate of pre-emption under the British Columbia Land Act, 1875, and Land Amendment Act, 1879, of 640 acres of unsurveyed lands within the 20 mile belt south of the C. P. R., reserved on the 29th Nov., 1883, under an agreement between the Governments of the Dominion and of the province of British Columbia, and which was ratified by 47 Vic., c. 14 (B.C.). On 29th Aug., 1885, this certificate was cancelled, and on the same day a like certificate was issued to respondents, and on the 31st July, 1889, letters-patent under the great seal of British Columbia were issued to respondents. By the agreement ratified by 47 Vic., c. 6 (D), it was also agreed that three and a half million additional acres in Peace River District should be conveyed to the Dominion Government in satisfaction of the right of the Dominion under the terms of union to have made good to it, from public lands contiguous to the railway belt, the quantity of land that might at the date of the conveyance be held under preemption right or by crown grant.\nOn an information by the Attorney General for Canada to recover possession of the 640 acres:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that the land in question was exempt from the statutory conveyance to the Dominion Government, and that upon the pre-emption right granted to D. et al. being subsequently abandoned or cancelled, the land became the property of the crown in right of the province, and not in right of the Dominion. Appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court[1], rendered on March 13, 1893, in favour of the defendants, upon an information of intrusion filed by the Attorney General of the Dominion of Canada, to recover possession of a lot of land within the Railway Belt in the province of British Columbia.\nThe statutes, agreements and facts bearing upon the case are as follows: \u2014\nBy the 11th section of the terms of union, under which Britith Columbia was admitted into confederation, the Province agreed to convey to the Dominion, in aid of a transcontinental railway, a belt of land not exceeding 20 miles on either side of the railway; and any deficiency caused by lands situate within the belt being held crown grant or under pre-emption right was to be made up from contiguous public lands[2].\nBy 43 Vic. cap. 11 (B.C.) passed 8th May, 1880, the Province granted to the Dominion a belt along the line of railway as it was then proposed to be located through Yellowhead Pass.\nBy 46 Vic. cap. 14 (B.C.) passed 12th May, 1883, an agreement between the Dominion and Province was ratified, and in accordance with it, and by reason of a contemplated change of route, a grant was made of a 20 mile belt on either side of the railway, wherever finally located. A difficulty in respect to ascertaining the exact qnantity of lands \"held under pre-emption right or crown grant\" was arranged by taking them roughly at 3,500,000 acres, and public lands to that extent in the Peace River district of British Columbia were granted to and accepted by the Dominion \"in satisfaction of all claims for additional lands under the terms of union. On September 10th, 1883, the lands now in dispute were pre-empted by Messrs. Dunbar, Wilson and Pillmore.\nOn November 5th, 1883, the Dominion Government agent notified the Provincial Government of the final adoption of practically the present line of railway, and requested the placing of a reserve on the lands within 20 miles on either side of such lines.\nOn November 29th, 1883, a notiee, reserving such belt, was published in the B. O. Gazette.\nBy 47 Vic. cap. 14 (B.C.), passed 19th December, 1883, the \"First Settlement Act\" was repealed, and the Province, among other things, granted to the Dominion the lands along the line of railway, \"whenever it may be finally located, to a width of 20 miles on either side of the said line, as provided in the Order in Council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into Confederation.\" The same arrangement was made as in the \"First Settlement Act,\" respecting lands in the belt theretofore alienated.\nBy 45 Vic., cap. 6 (D), the Dominion Parliament, on the 19th April, 1884, ratified the above settlement.\nOn 16th January, 1885, the line or the portion thereof which affected these lands was finally located and the lands which passed by the \"Second Settlement Act,\" would be capable of being ascertained.\nOn August 29th, 1885, Dunbar and associates abandoned their pre-emption in favour of the respondents, who on the same date received a pre-emption record from the Provincial Government land agent.\nOn July 31st, 1889, a grant under the great seal of the province was issued to respondents.\nHogg Q.C. for appellant contended:\u2014\n(1.) That the Dominion, upon the abandonment or cancellation of a pre-emption of land within the railway belt, is entitled to the lands, although the same were held under pre-emption right at the time of the statutory conveyance of the belt by the province.\n(2.) That Dunbar and his associates did not hold these lands under pre-emption right within the meaning of the terms of union, and cited and referred to Queen v. Farwell[3]; 11th paragraph terms of union, 1871[4].\nDalton McCarthy Q. C. for the respondent. The lands which were held under pre-emption right at the time of the statutory conveyance, were as much excepted from its operation as if they had been described by metes and bounds. The same argument, which would establish the right of the Dominion to these lands upon the abandonment of the pre-emption, would also give to the Dominion the right to the ultimate reversion of lands within the belt, which were at the same time \"held by crown grant,\" and this is not tenable. Mercer v. The Attorney General of Ontario[5].\nMoreover, the province has given for every acre held under pre-emption right at the time of the statutory conveyance a corresponding acre in the Peace River country, and the Dominion has no more interest in the subsequent dealings with such land than the province has in the disposal of the equivalent parcel in the Peace River district.\nThese lands were not included in the reserve of the 29th November, 1883, for the authority for making such reserve was section 60 of the Land Act, 1875 (1875, cap. 5), which authorizes the reserve of \"any lands not lawfully held by record, pre-emption, purchase, lease or crown grant, for the purpose of conveying the same to the Dominion Government in trust, * * for railway purposes, as mentioned in article 11 of the terms of union.\" The second contention of appellants, viz., that the Dunbar pre-emption was not a valid method of holding lands under pre-emption right, within the meaning of the terms of union, seems to be founded on a change in the terminology of the land laws. It is attempted to construe the words \"held under preemption right,\" in the light of the amended land law existing in 1885, instead of in the light of \"The Land Act, 1870,\" which alone was in existence when the terms of union were drawn up. At that time almost all the province was unsurveyed, it was sold by public auction with an upset price\u2014Land Act, 1870, sec. 44; Revised Laws, 1871, cap. 144.\nBy the \"Land Act, 1875\" (1875, cap. 5), this policy was changed, and both surveyed and unsurveyed lands were open to pre-emption, and the only material difference in the provisions was the necessary regulations provided for survey. For distinction's sake the proceedings relating to acquiring unsurveyed land were called \"recording,\" and surveyed lands \"pre-empting.\"\nThe settler had the privilege in the case of either class of land, upon performance of the statutory conditions, to acquire the title to his lot and this is the essence of pre-emption.\nThe following were cited and relied on:\u2014\nAnderson's Law Dictionary[6]; Dillingham v. Fisher[7]; Hosmer v. Wallace[8]; Sioux City Land Co. v. Griffey[9]; Hastings and Dakota Railroad Co. v. Whitney[10]; Kansas Pacific Railroad Co. v. Dunmeyer[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne. FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Were also of the same opinion.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed with costs. It cannot I think be doubted that the lands covered by the pre-emption certificate issued by the British Columbia Government to Dunbar, Wilson and Pillmore on the 10th Sept., 1883, did not form part of the lands within what is called the Railway Belt in British Columbia, which were granted by the Government and Legislature of British Columbia in virtue of the agreement between the Governments of British Columbia and of the Dominion of Canada affirmed and approved by the British Columbia statute 47 Vic. ch. 14, passed on the 19th December, 1883, and by the Dominion statute, 47 Vic. ch. 6, passed on the 19th April, 1884, but on the contrary that the land in question, consisting of 640 acres for which such pre-emption certificate had issued, constituted part of the lands within the said Railway Belt for which, because they were not included or intended to be included in the lands within the said belt so granted to the Dominion Government, they formed part of the lands for which the lands in the Peace River District were by the same acts granted and accepted by way of compensation. The land in question therefore never in law or fact passed or was intended to pass to the Dominion Government, and consequently, there is no place for the contention that upon the original pre-emption certificate being abandoned the land reverted to Her Majesty in right of the Dominion Government. The original preemption ticket remained beyond all question in full force until the 29th August, 1885, when what is relied upon as its abandonment took place as follows, and as would seem, although no evidence upon the point appears to have been asked for or given, for the purpose of substituting, with the consent of the British Columbia Government, the appellants in the place of Dunbar and the others named in the original pre-emption certificate with their consent. On the 29th August, 1885, Dunbar, Wilson and Pillmore appeared to have attended at the Government Land Commissioners Office and expressed their willingness to abandon and abandoned their certificate, the respondents at the same time attended at the same place and applied for and received a certificate of pre-emption record issued by the Government to them in the place and stead of the certificate so abandoned by Dunbar and his associates, which was filed away in the Government office and indorsed \"abandoned.\"\nUpon the 28th September, 1892, the Government of British Columbia having been duly satisfied as required by law that the respondents had made improvements upon the land exceeding $2.50 per acre, amounting in the whole to $1,860, issued letters patent under the great seal of the province of British Columbia granting the land to them.\nThe verbal distinction, if any there be, between the terms \"pre-empting\" and \"recording\" the rights of actual settlers apparently indifferently used in the British Columbia statutes, has no bearing whatever in my opinion upon the question under consideration. The claim made on behalf of the Dominion Government to the land in question appears to me to be utterly devoid of foundation.\nKING J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitor for respondents: A.

A. & Sons, assigned all his property and effects to H. for benefit of creditors. H., by power of attorney, authorized A. to collect all moneys due his estate, etc., and to carry on the business if expedient. A. continued the business as before and in the course of it purchased goods from F. to whom on some occasions he gave notes signed \"J. A. & Sons, H. trustee per A.\" All the goods so purchased from F. were charged in his books to J. A. & Sons, and the dealings between them after the assignment continued for five years. Finally, A. being unable to pay what was due to F. the latter brought an action against H. on notes signed as above and for the price of goods so sold to A.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the evidence at the trial of the action clearly showed that the credit for the goods sold was given to A. and not to H.; that A. did not carry on the business after the assignment at the instance or as the agent of H. nor for the benefit of his estate; that A. was not authorized to sign H.'s name to notes as he did; and that H. was not liable either as the person to whom credit was given or as an undisclosed principal.\nHeld further, that if H. was guilty of a breach of trust in allowing A. full control over the estate that would not make him liable to F. in this action.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nOne James Allen carried on business in Halifax under the firm name of John Allen & Sons and being unable to meet his engagements assigned all his estate and effects to his brother-in-law, the defendant Hechler, in trust for the benefit of his creditors. Hechler after the assignment gave to Allen a power of attorney authorizing him, among other things, \"to sign, draw, make and indorse my name as such trustee as aforesaid to any cheques or orders for the payment of money, bill or bills of exchange, or note or notes of hand, in which I am or shall be interested or concerned as such trustee as aforesaid and which shall be requisite.\" The trust deed provided that the trustee might employ Allen to carry on the trade if thought expedient.\nAllen continued after the assignment to carry on the business as before and in doing so continued to purchase goods from the plaintiff, giving him in some instances promissory notes signed \"John Allen & Sons, Hechler trustee, per James Allen.\" This went on for five years when, Allen having again become embarrassed and unable to meet his engagements, the plaintiff brought an action against Hechler on notes signed as above and for the price of goods sold to Allen.\nThe facts of the case are more fully stated in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick, who also sets out the material part of the evidence at the trial.\nAn action had been brought in the county court by one Anderson who had also sold goods to Allen after the assignment against Allen and Hechler, in which the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on appeal from the judgment in the county court, had held Hechler liable[1]. On the trial of the present action judgment was given against Hechler, the trial judge holding that the case was governed by the decision in the county court action. Borden Q.C., for the appellant referred to Smethurst v. Mitchell[2]; Scarf v. Jardine[3]; Evans on Agency[4].\nHarrington Q.C., for the respondent cited Watteau v. Fenwick[5], as stating the law as to an undisclosed principal.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 2nd of January, 1886, the firm of John Allen & Sons, composed of one James Allen only, being in financial difficulties made an assignment of its estate to the appellant Henry Hechler upon the trusts usual in such cases. It was by the assignment declared that the trustee Hechler might employ Allen or any other person in carrying out the trusts, and in carrying on the trade if thought expedient, and to pay Allen if thought expedient out of the trust moneys any sum not exceeding $100 per month. On the following day Hechler, by power of attorney, appointed Allen his attorney, giving him authority \"to sign, draw, make and indorse his name as such trustee as aforesaid, to any cheque or cheques, or orders for the payment of money, bill or bills of exchange, or note or notes of hand, in which he was or should be interested and which should be requisite.\" These two instruments were filed with the registrar of deeds in the city of Halifax where the business was carried on. It would appear that upon the execution of the assignment and power of attorney, Hechler, the trustee, left the whole conduct of affairs to James Allen, assignor, and that for several years afterwards, in fact until he was threatened with legal proceedings, he never in any way examined into the condition of the estate, or ascertained to what extent Allen, as his attorney, had administered the estate. In fact I infer from the evidence that previous to the assignment in question the firm of John Allen & Sons, being insolvent, were being sued, and the assignment was made with a view of preventing the institution of further legal proceedings, and that Hechler (who was Allen's brother-in-law) permitted his name to be used as trustee, trusting to Allen's honesty in his faithfully administering the trust, and practically giving himself no concern about the matter. Up to the time of the commencement of this suit the estate had never been wound up nor, so far as appears, had any creditor interested in the trust found fault in any way with Hechler's administration of it.\nAt the time of the assignment the plaintiff, Greorge E. Forsyth, a wholesale supply merchant in Halifax, was a creditor of Allen in the sum of $100. After the assignment it would seem that Allen continued carrying on business of the same character in the same place and under the same firm name as previously. When the assignment was made, according to the testimony of the plaintiff's chief clerk, Allen promised to pay him the $100 in full and the account was \"carried over\" from the date of the assignment in 1886 and charged in the usual way to the Allen firm. The plaintiff continued until September, 1891, more than five years, to sell goods to the firm of John Allen & Sons in the ordinary way, these goods for the most part being delivered upon orders signed by the Allen firm and charged in the plaintiff's account books to that firm without reference of any kind to the trustee Hechler. According to the evidence of the plaintiff's book-keeper the plaintiff never read or saw the power of attorney above referred to and could not tell when first he knew of its existence. Until about the commencement of these proceedings the defendant Hechler never received any account from the plaintiff nor did he ever receive any intimation from him that he was considered as liable in connection with any of Allen's transactions subsequent to the date of the assignment. The original debt of $100 was paid by Allen as agreed shortly after the assignment, so that the transactions in question in this suit are all transactions subsequent to the date of the assignment. It would appear that sometime thereafter Allen began giving notes to the plaintiff, not in connection with any specific purchase of goods but generally in connection with his indebtedness. These notes were signed as follows:\u2014\"John Allen & Sons, Henry Hechler, trustee, per James Allen;\" and it is upon one of these notes so signed, and for the price of goods sold and delivered, that this action is brought.\nTwo questions only, I think, arise upon this appeal First, to whom was credit given, Allen or Hechler? Secondly, did. Allen in the dealings in question act as the agent of Hechler or did he act on his own account? In reference to the first question I am of opinion that the plaintiff gave credit to Allen only. There is not a scintilla of evidence to show the contrary, the evidence in my view conclusively demonstrating that Forsyth contracted with Allen alone. The plaintiff himself did not give any evidence at the trial, nor is his absence in any way accounted for. It is, I suppose, upon the testimony of James Billman, his chief clerk, that he relies in order to make out a case against Hechler; yet he testifies that \"the account before the trust was charged against John Allen & Sons; about $100 then due. It was carried over. Allen promised to pay in full and it was just carried on; the account was continued with the same heading, John Allen & Sons, after the trust deed.\" I can gather no idea from the phrases \"carried over\" and \"carried on\" except that of continuing the same kind of business between the same parties. There is not even a suggestion by Billman that Hechler was in any way responsible for purchases subsequent to the trust deed. It is true that in one case Billman thinks he sent an account to Hechler, but Hechler testifies that he never received it and I think it extremely doubtful if he did. It must have been present to the minds of both Forsyth and Allen when the promise to pay in full was made that Allen was to continue to carry on business. He had divested himself of all his property. It was understood that subsequent to the assignment there was to be a continuance of their old dealings, and as a matter of fact these old dealings did continue in precisely the same old way for more than five years when it appears Allen again got into difficulties, and then, for the first time, Hechler was sought to be made liable for Allen's account. In addition to these facts there is the undisputed evidence of Allen himself, and of his chief clerk, that Hechler had no connection whatever with any dealings in question after the assignment. So much in regard to the first question.\nIt might be, however, that even although the plaintiff gave credit to Allen alone yet, if as a matter of fact Allen was acting throughout as the agent of Hechler in carrying on the business for the benefit of the trust estate, Hechler would, under such circumstances, be liable as an undisclosed principal for the claim in question. In my view, however, the evidence does not point to any such conclusion. It is true that under the assignment the trustee had power, at his own discretion, to employ Allen or any other person in carrying on the trade if thought expedient, and to pay Allen a salary for that purpose. The onus of showing, first, that it was thought expedient to carry on the trade for the benefit of the trust, and secondly, that Allen was employed by Hechler for the purpose of carrying on that trade, is on the plaintiff. He has, of course, proved that Allen did carry on that business, but has signally failed in proving that he carried it on either at the instance and as the agent of Hechler or for the benefit of his estate. The sworn testimony is undisputably the other way. That testimony it is sought to overcome by inferences of the most doubtful and ambiguous character. It must be borne in mind that Allen's status, his right to trade, to buy and sell, his capacity to contract on his own account and for his own benefit, remained precisely the same after as before the assignment. His was not the position of an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. Had that been his position there might have been some ground for the inference that he was carrying the business on as an agent and for the benefit of his estate, but I myself am at a loss to understand how that inference can be drawn from the facts in the present case. Hechler himself swears that he never authorized Allen to purchase goods; that he never received anything out of the estate or any profits from the business; that although he knew he was doing business of some kind (as I suppose every person in business in Halifax knew as well), he did not know what business he was doing; that he seldom went there, even although he was his brother-in-law, and that he never looked at the books until 1891, after proceedings seeking to make him liable for Allen's subsequent debts were instituted against him. All this evidence is corroborated by the testimony of Allen and Russell, his book-keeper, and there is not any evidence whatever pointing in a contrary direction except the giving of notes signed by Allen in Hechler's name. It would seem that some time after the assignment\u2014it does not appear how long after, it may have been years\u2014Allen began to give notes to Forsyth, signed as above mentioned. These notes, as I have stated, were signed in the manner indicated above by Allen himself without the knowledge or special authority of Hechler. In order to make Hechler liable upon them it was necessary to show agency or authority. The only authority, apart from inference, was the power of attorney put in evidence; that power of attorney authorized Allen to sign Hechler's name, as trustee of his estate, to any notes of hand in which Hechler was interested or concerned as trustee. If, as a matter of fact, the business was not being carried on by Hechler, then he was neither interested nor concerned as trustee in these notes, and Allen was acting in bad faith, to say the least of it, in signing them. The evidence, as I have shown, is all the other way. Forsyth never made any inquiries in regard to Allen's authority, wanting, I suppose, to use the notes, as it would appear from the evidence he did for the purposes of discount The question of liability on these notes depends altogether upon the question: Was the business being carried on by Allen, on Hechler's account, for the benefit of his estate? If so then Hechler was liable, if otherwise he was not liable. I have unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that the business was Allen's alone; Hechler's liability upon the notes, therefore, has not been established.\nIt would appear that in the case of Anderson v. Allen before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on appeal from the County Court, the court held, under circumstances similar to those in the present case, that Hechler was liable. I understand that it was solely in consequence of that ruling that Mr. Justice Graham, the trial judge, here decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. I regret that I have not had the benefit of a perusal of the judgment of the appeal court in that case, no public report of it having as yet reached me[6].\nI entirely concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Townshend in this case. I wish to add, that the question here is not whether any breach of trust has been committed by Hechler; he may in that event be called upon to account and make good the consequences of his confidence in Allen (his brother-in-law.) By no process of reasoning known to me can I conclude that for such failure of duty he is to be made responsible for all debts which Allen may happen to have contracted after he took upon himself the trust in question.\nIn my view the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment should be entered for the defendant Hechler with all his costs in the cause, including the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal involves nothing but a question of fact namely, to whom was credit given? I do not think that the appellant has made the clear case necessary to justify our interfering with the finding of the trial judge, approved of as it has been by the court in banco.

Beaver (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1893: November 2; 1894: February 20.\nPresent: Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Co.\u2014Passenger\u2014Purchase of ticket by\u2014Production of ticket to conductor\u2014Refusal to produce\u2014Ejectment from train\u2014Liability of company\u2014General Railway Act, 51 Vic. c. 29 (D), secs. 247 and 248.\nBy sec. 248 of the General Railway Act (51 V. c. 29), any passenger on a railway train who refuses to pay his fare may be put off the train.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Fournier J. dissenting, that the contract between the person buying a railway ticket and the company on whose line it is intended to be used implies that such ticket shall be produced and delivered up to the conductor of the train on which such person travels, and if he is put off a train for refusing or being unable so to produce and deliver it up the company is not liable to an action for such ejectment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only question to be decided by this appeal, is whether or not a passenger on a railway train who has purchased a ticket, but has lost or mislaid it, can be lawfully put off the train under the provisions of the Railway Acts of Canada and the act of incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. for refusing to produce and deliver up such ticket to the conductor. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court which maintained the passenger\u2019s right of action for being ejected.\nThe facts of the case and the statutes are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Nesbitt for the appellants. In construing an act of Parliament its scope and the purposes for which it was passed are to be considered; In re Anglesea Colliery Co.[3]; and if these defendants are liable sec. 248 of the Railway Act could not operate.\nThe American decisions are strongly against the plaintiff. Chicago and Alton Railroad Co. v. Willard[4]; Hibbard v. New York and Erie Railroad Co.[5]; Crawford v. Cincinnati, etc., Railroad Co.[6] And see Duke v. The Great Western Railway Co.[7]\nDuVernet for the respondent. The defendants contracted to carry the plaintiff to Caledonia and have failed to fulfil their contract. See Butler v. The Manchester, etc., Railway Co.[8], on which the Court of Appeal relied; Henderson v. Stevenson[9]; Maples v. New York, etc., Railroad Co.[10]; The Queen v. Caister[11].\nAs to the liability of the defendants for the conductor\u2019s acts see Ferguson on Rights and Duties of Railways[12].\nMcCarthy Q.C. in reply. In Butler v. Manchester, etc., Railway Co.5 the only penalty for not producing a ticket was payment of fare from the nearest station, and the conductor ejected the passenger. That case is distinguishable from this where the statute expressly authorizes ejectment. FOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by Osler J. in his dissenting opinion. The following United States cases support that view of the case:\u2014\nChicago & Alton Railroad Company v. Willard[13]. The Illinois statute provides \u201cthat if any passenger on any railroad, car or train shall refuse upon reasonable demand to pay his fare, or shall etc. (relating to disorderly conduct) it shall be lawful for the conductor of the train to remove or cause to be removed such passenger from the train.\u201d In this case, the facts were almost identical with those in the present.\nIn Hibbard v. New York and Erie Railroad Co.[14] it was held that a passenger who had once exhibited his ticket and refused to do so again when requested by the conductor might be put off the train.\nIn Crawford v. The Cincinnati Hamilton and Drayton Railroad Co.[15] it was held that the purchaser of anon-transferable commutation ticket who had lost it, and refused on account of such loss to pay his fare upon the train, could not maintain an action of tort against the company to recover damages for being ejected by the conductor in compliance with a rule requiring him to do so in case of non-production of a ticket and refusal to pay fare.\nTo the same effect is Shelton v. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Co.[16]\nAlso Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co. v. Fleming[17]. The court in its judgment quotes from and adopts the language used in Frederick v. Marquette, etc., Railroad Co.[18]: There is but one rule which can safely be tolerated with any decent regard to the rights of railroad companies and passengers generally. As between the conductor and passenger, and the rights of the latter to travel, the ticket produced must be conclusive evidence, and he must produce it when called upon as the evidence of his right to the seat he claims.\nIn Jerome v. Smith[19] Wheeler J., in delivering the judgment of the court, says at page 234:\nHaving lost his ticket he was called upon by the proper conductor to pay his fare. He had not any ticket or cheque to pay it with, and refused to pay it in money, consequently there was a refusal to pay it at all and the conductor rightfully expelled him from the train.\nIn Haley v. Chicago and North-western Railway Co.[20], where an intoxicated man was forcibly ejected from a train upon failing to show a ticket or to pay fare, and was killed, it was held that he was rightly ejected.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case has proceeded in the courts below upon the authority of Butler v. Manchester & Sheffield Railway Co.[21], which case, as has been ably pointed out by Mr. Justice Osler in his judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, has no application in the circumstances of the present case. Judgments of the courts in England upon cases arising there upon statutes wholly different in terms from the statutes of the Dominion of Canada affecting the same subject matter cannot have any binding effect upon the courts in this country in cases arising upon the statutes in force here. In Butler v. The Manchester & Sheffield Railway Co.21 there was no statute authorizing the conductor of a railway train to put a passenger off the train either because of non-payment of his fare to the conductor or for non-production of a ticket.\nThe company were empowered by statute to make by-laws for regulating their passenger traffic. They did make such by-laws among which they enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo passenger will be allowed to enter any carriage used on the railway unless furnished by the company with a ticket specifying the class of carriage and the stations for conveyance between which the ticket is issued.\nEvery passenger shall show and deliver up his ticket to any duly authorized servant of the company when required to do so for any purpose, and any passenger travelling without a ticket or failing or refusing to deliver up his ticket as aforesaid shall be required to pay the fare from the station whence the train originally started to the end of his journey.\nAnd it was held that this by-law did not authorize the conductor to put a passenger off a train who did not produce a ticket authorizing him to travel on the train and who excused himself by the allegation that he had purchased a ticket but had lost it, for the by-law had imposed in such a state of facts an obligation only upon the passenger to pay the fare from the place whence the train had originally started to the place of his destination, and therefore that putting the passenger off the train was an actionable wrong. Now in the present case it is true that the Grand Trunk Railway Company, ever since their incorporation in 1852, have had power to make by-laws regulating the traffic on their railway; and they have done so, but there is among them no by-law in relation to the particular subject under discussion nor, as the company contend, is there any necessity for such a by-law inasmuch as their case is, as they contend, provided for by statute. As far back as 1851 the General Railway Clauses Act, 14 & 15 Vic. ch. 51 which is incorporated with the Grand Trunk Railway incorporation act, 16 Vic. ch. 37, in its 21st sec. subsec. 1, which is incorporated into the Consolidated Railway Act, 51 Vic. ch. 29, as sec. 247 of that act, enacted as follows:\u2014 Every servant of the undertaking employed in a passenger train or at stations for passengers shall wear upon his hat or cap a badge which shall indicate his office, and he shall not without such badge be entitled to demand or receive from any passenger any fare or ticket or to exercise any of the powers of his office, nor meddle or interfere with any passenger or his baggage or property.\nAnd in the sixth subsection of the same sec. 21, which is incorporated as sec. 248 of the Railway Act 51 Vic. ch. 29, it was enacted that:\u2014\nPassengers refusing to pay their fare may by the conductor of the train and the servants of the company be, with their baggage, put out of the cars using no unnecessary force at any usual stopping place or near any dwelling house as the conductor shall elect, first stopping the train.\nThe statute law which the defendants invoke in their defence was enacted as far back as 1851 and has ever since continued in force without any alteration in its terms and must be construed now, appearing as it does verbatim et literatim in the Railway Act of 1888 sections 247 and 248, precisely as it would have been construed immediately after the first passing of the act in 1851, that is to say, having regard to the circumstances and condition of the country and the ordinary practice of railway companies in their first institution in the province and which has continued to the present day in relation to the collection of the fares of passengers travelling on railways\u2014the practice being for passengers to pay their fares to the conductors on the trains either in money or by handing to him a ticket purchased by the passenger before entering the train. In modern times the purchasing tickets before entering the train is more general than it formerly was but it is still quite optional with passengers to purchase a ticket for the purpose of being delivered to the conductor on the train as and for the passenger\u2019s fare, or to pay the fare in money to the conductor. It is in relation to this state of things so existing at the time of the passing of the act that we must construe the provisions of the law invoked by the defendants. That law, for the security of the passenger, enacts that no person on a passenger train shall be entitled to receive or demand from any passenger any fare, or ticket, unless he shall wear a badge indicating his office. This section plainly implies a dealing by the legislature with a practice well known to exist of the companies, through some servant of theirs, collecting upon the trains when in course of travelling on the railway the fares of passengers either in money or in tickets, if any there should be, authorizing the holder to travel on the train upon which he should produce it. Then for the protection of the companies the statute enacts that it should be lawful for the conductor of a train of cars to put off the train a passenger refusing to pay his fare. It is obvious that this refusal spoken of in the statute is a refusal to pay the fare to the conductor the person recognized by the statute as the person authorized to collect the fares of all passengers travelling upon the train of which he is conductor and who for such refusal is empowered to put the passenger off the train. Now a passenger may pay his fare to the conductor in money or in a ticket or bon issued by the company as \u201cgood\u201d for the fare if used of the date for which it is issued; but to avoid being in the position of a person refusing to pay his fare to the conductor the passenger must upon demand by the conductor deliver to him either money or such a bon in satisfaction of his fare for being conveyed upon that train. The conductor of any passenger train is, in a plain, common sense understanding of the terms of the statute, the person responsible for the collection of the fares of all passengers upon his train and the person to be satisfied of such payment either in money or by the production of a ticket allowing the person producing it to travel on the train of which he is the conductor. The judgment appealed from is to the effect that this is not so, but that when a railway company issues a ticket to a purchaser thereof for a passage on a particular train such ticket constitutes a contract between the purchaser and the company that the company will carry the purchaser upon such train, and that they must do so whether he produces the ticket to the conductor or not; and that in case even of his refusal to produce to the conductor or to pay his fare in money to him he cannot under the terms of the statute be put off the train but must be carried to whatever place upon the railway to which the train by which he is travelling goes that he may select as the point of his destination. In short that the conductor is a wrong doer, and the company responsible for his wrong, if he should put a passenger off his train who excuses himself for not paying the conductor his fare in money by the simple allegation that he had purchased a ticket which authorized him to travel upon the train on which he was but that he had forgotten to bring it with him\u2014or that he had lost it\u2014or that he had destroyed it\u2014or that he had it in his pocket but would not produce it; such a construction would render the statute absolutely inoperative.\nBut let us consider what is the true nature of the contract involved in the ticket which the plaintiff had purchased, and which he had not with him, or if he had did not produce, when on the train from which he was put off.\nIt was upon its face declared to be:\nGood only for a continuous trip from Detroit to Caledonia until October 14, 1892.\nNow, construing the contract evidenced by that ticket in the language of Lord Esher in Butler v. The Manchester and Sheffield Railway Co.[22] as implying only such terms as were clearly and obviously in the contem- plation of the parties, can it be doubted for a moment that both parties had in contemplation what had been the practice and user ever since the introduction of railways into Canada, without ever a doubt being entertained upon the point, namely, that the ticket was purchased by the purchaser and was issued by the company for the sole purpose of being produced to the conductor of the train upon which the purchaser should travel upon the faith of it, to be taken up by such conductor as and for the fare of the purchaser for his being carried upon such train, and upon the thorough understanding and intent that, unless so produced, it was utterly valueless and good for nothing? It was only when so produced within the period mentioned on the ticket that it was to be, or could be, good for the continuous trip also mentioned on the ticket. The contract simply was to convey the purchaser upon one continuous trip from Detroit to Caledonia (up to the 14th October, 1892) upon any train of the company travelling between those two places upon which the purchaser should travel, and when called upon for his fare should produce and deliver up the ticket to the conductor of the train as and for such fare.\nNo other construction of the contract is admissible, and this being the plain, sensible construction of the contract the plaintiff, upon the facts in evidence, was, when called upon for his fare by the conductor, in the same position precisely as if he had never purchased the ticket, and not having paid his fare to the conductor was, in the terms of the provision of the statute in that behalf, liable to be put off the train by him.\nIn 1857, in Duke v. The Great Western Railway Co.[23], a precisely similar question arose upon the pleadings under an act relating to the Great Western Railway 16 Vic. chap. 99, the twelfth section of which (the Great Western Railway not being subject to the provisions of the general Railway Act of 1851, was similar to the above provisions extracted from 14 & 15 Vic. chap 51. The late Chief Justice Sir John B. Robinson, delivering judgment in that case, makes use of language precisely applicable to the present case. He says there:\nMrs. Duke had paid for a ticket, and got it. Yet we must know what every one else knows, that still, after such payment, each passenger has to account for his passage to the conductor, in effect to pay him, for the company does not know to what person by name tickets are issued, nor does the officer that issues them at the station know. He only exchanges tickets for money without any reference to the person paying, and the system can only be carried out so as to prevent fraud by its being considered that the reckoning between the individual and the company takes place when the conductor goes round and receives payment from every person he sees there, taking money from those who have no ticket, and receiving tickets as money from those who have procured them by paying at the station.\nThis practical common sense understanding of the statute, as here expressed, has never been questioned, that I am aware of, until the decision in the present case now under consideration in appeal. It was doubtless in view of the facts and circumstances above treated by the learned chief justice, as being in the knowledge of every one, that the sections extracted from 14 & 15 Vic. chap. 51 were enacted, and were re-enacted in 22 Vic. chap. 66, secs. 95 and 106; and again in the Railway Act of 1868, 31 Vic., chap. 68, sec. 20, subsecs. 1 and 12; and again in the Railway Act of 1879, 42 Vic. chap. 9, sec. 25, subsecs. 1 and 12; and again, in 1886, in chap. 109 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, sec. 25, subsecs. 1 and 12; and again, lastly, in 1888, in 51 Vic. ch. 29 sections 247 and 248. In the courts of the United States where the practice as to the mode of issuing and collecting tickets in payment of fares is identical with that existing in Canada the law is laid down in the same manner. In one of them, Frederick v. The Marquette Railroad Co.[24], the court pronouncing judgment say:\u2014\nIt is within the common knowledge and experience of all travellers that the uniform and perhaps the universal practice is for all railroad companies to issue tickets to passengers with the places designated thereon from whence and to which the passenger is to be carried\u2014and that these tickets are presented to the conductor or person in charge of the train and that he unhesitatingly accepts such tickets.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThere of course will be cases where a passenger who has lost his ticket, or where through mistake a wrong ticket has been issued to him, will be obliged to pay his fare a second time.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThere is but one rule which can safely be tolerated with any decent regard to the rights of railroad companies and passengers generally. As between the conductor and passenger and the right of the latter to travel the ticket produced must be conclusive evidence and he must produce it when called upon as the evidence of his right to the seat he claims.\nIn the acts of the state of New York 1850, ch. 140 section 35, is a provision in language so identical with that of subsection 6 of section 21 of 14 & 15 Vic. ch. 51 that the latter seems to have been taken from the former. And in Willets v. The Buffalo and Rochester Railroad Co.[25], the Supreme Court of the state of New York, with reference to that statute, say:\u2014\nIt is however argued that as the fare has been paid to Buffalo the act of the conductor cannot be justified (for putting off the train before reaching Buffalo a passenger who neither produced a ticket or paid the fare in money). Our attention has been directed to a provision of the general railroad act of 1850 which makes it lawful for a conductor if a passenger refuses to pay his fare to put him and his baggage off the cars.\nAnd again:\u2014\nCan it be maintained that the company and its servants are bound to know whether the particular individual has paid his fare? This under the present mode of travelling would be impossible. In another case Townsend v. The New York Central Railroad Co.[26], it was held by the Court of Appeal for the state of New York that the conductor of a train is not bound to take the word of a passenger that he had purchased a ticket showing his right to a passage on that train. Indeed it stands to reason and common sense that nothing but the production of a ticket to the conductor on the train upon which a passenger is travelling will fulfil the purpose for which the ticket was issued, namely, to be delivered up to the conductor of the train which the passenger enters to be carried upon the faith of his ticket which when so produced operates as a payment to the conductor of the passenger\u2019s fare for his being carried on that train.\nThe only question in the present case is whether the facts in evidence bring the case within the purview of the statute which has equal, if not greater, binding effect than a by-law, rule or regulation of the company in like terms would have, and for the reasons given I am of opinion, both upon principle and authority, that they do, and that therefore the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose restored.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitor for respondent: V.

Clark (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nEliza Hagar (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1893: November 6, 7; 1894: February 20.\nPresent: Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nConveyance\u2014Illegal or immoral consideration\u2014Intention of grantor\u2014Character of grantee\u2014Pleading.\nUnder the judicature Act of Ontario an action for foreclosure is not to be regarded as including a right to recover possession of the mortgage premises as in ejectment, and the rule that in such action the plaintiff may obtain an order for delivery of possession does not apply to a case in which the mortgage sought to be foreclosed is held void and plaintiff claims title as original owner and vendor.\nUnder said Judicature Act, as formerly, the plea to an action on a contract that it was entered into for an immoral or illegal consideration must set out the particular facts relied upon as establishing such consideration.\nQu\u0153re: Can the purchaser of the equity of redemption set up such defence as against a mortgagee seeking to foreclose or is the defence confined to the immediate parties to the contract?\nA contract for transfer of property with intent by the transferor, and for the purpose, that it shall be applied by the transferee to the accomplishment of an illegal or immoral purpose is void and cannot be enforced; but mere knowledge of the transferor of the intention of the transferee so to apply it will not avoid the contract unless, from the particular nature of the property, and the character and occupation of the transferee, a just inference can be drawn that the transferor must also have so intended. Judgment of the Court of Appeal affirmed, Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of this case are full set out in the judgment of the court and may be summarized as follows:\u2014 The plaintiff, Hagar, had sold a house to one Jennie O\u2019Neill who was, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, a prostitute. A mortgage was given for part of the purchase money and plaintiff brought an action against said O\u2019Neill and the defendant Clarke to whom the equity of redemption had been conveyed to foreclose it. At the trial defendants did not appear and judgment for possession of the land was given against them. Clarke then applied for and obtained a new trial on affidavits showing that part of the purchase money on the sale to O\u2019Neill was for the good will of the house as a house of ill-fame and he claimed, therefore, that the mortgage was void to the extent of such immoral consideration. The present appeal was from a decision of the Court of Appeal holding the mortgage valid.\nClarke, appellant in person. The courts will not aid the enforcement of an immoral or illegal contract. Harris v. Fontaine[1]; Furlong v. Russell[2]; Smith v. Benton[3]; Peoples Bank v. Johnson[4].\nAs to the right to plead illegality not appearing on the face of an instrument see Collins v. Blantern[5]; Bonisteel v. Saylor[6]; Jones v. Merionethshire Building Soc.[7]\nThe appellant referred also to Windhill Local Board v. Vint[8]; Sprott v. United States[9]; Hanauer v. Doane[10].\nArmour Q.C. for the respondent. The acts constituting illegality should be set out in the defence. In re Vallance[11]: Gray v. Mathias[12]; Hall v. Palmer[13]; Waugh v. Morris[14]. On the merits the learned counsel referred to Taylor v. Bowers[15]; Roberts v. Roberts[16]; Pawson v. Brown[17].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action for foreclosure of a mortgage instituted by the mortgagee against the mortgagor and the appellant, to whom the mortgagor sold and conveyed the premises, subject, however, expressly to the mortgage and to payment of the moneys thereby secured. The plaintiff, having at the trial waived all relief against the mortgagor, we may, under the circumstances, treat the appellant, who is solely seized of the equity of redemption, as the sole defendant. In his statement of defence he alleged that the consideration for the execution of the mortgage was illegal and immoral, and that therefore the mortgage was void and of none effect. To this the plaintiff replied, denying what was so alleged, and saying that if it should be found that the consideration was illegal the mortgagor was a party thereto, and that neither she nor the appellant, her grantee of the premises, could set up such a defence to plaintiff\u2019s claim. The case came down for trial in October, 1890, when the defendant applied for a postponement of the trial, upon grounds which did not appear to the learned trial judge to be sufficient. Thereupon the case proceeded, and no defence being offered judgment for foreclosure of the mortgage, as prayed by the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, was rendered for the plaintiff Subsequently a motion for a new trial was made to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, founded upon affidavits of the mortgagor and the appellant, to the effect in substance that the mortgage was executed to secure payment of part of the purchase money of a dwelling house purchased from the mortgagee by the mortgagor, who was, as the mortgagee well knew, a prostitute, and that $2,000 of the purchase money for the house was in the contract of purchase and sale estimated as the value of the house as a house of prostitution, for the good-will, as it is called, of the house as a house used for purposes of prostitution. Upon these affidavits the court made an order that upon payment by the defendant to the plaintiff, on or before the. 27th of February then next, of the full amount found due for debt, interest and costs by the judgment for foreclosure rendered in the action, less the interest not then yet accrued, and less the sum of $2,000 of principal money and the interest thereon, together with the costs of the motion to set aside the judgment, the judgment should be set aside, and the court thereby further adjudged that upon the said 27th of February there would be due to the plaintiff for balance of principal money $1,625, and for balance of interest $140.17, and for taxed costs up to judgment $206.02, and for subsequent costs $115.39, amounting together to $2,086.58, and the court did further order that upon payment of that sum to the plaintiff, on or before the said 27th day of February, the plaintiff should execute and deliver to the defendant a release of the mortgage, save as to the amount of $2,000, for principal and interest thereon from the 5th December, 1889, and the court did further order that upon such payment being made then a new trial should be had, and that in default of such payment the motion to set aside the judgment for foreclosure should be dismissed. Upon this order being made the now appellant paid the said sum of $2,086.58 in pursuance of the order, and the case came down again for trial in April, 1891, before Street J., when the mortgage was put in, and its execution being admitted the plaintiff\u2019s case closed, whereupon counsel for the defence opened the defence as follows, as stated in the appeal case as presented to us:\u2014\nThe contention (he said) is that this mortgage was given as part of the purchase money of the house No. 32 Albert St., Toronto. As a defence to this action the defendants set up that the house was bought to the knowledge of the plaintiff by the mortgagor for the purpose of carrying on a house of ill-fame\u2014that part of the consideration was the good\u2011will of the place as a house of ill-fame and therefore being an illegal consideration the plaintiff cannot recover. The amount paid is the full value of the place at the time it was bought and we say the amount in dispute now, $2,000, was for the good-will of the place.\nThis latter is the special point for the purpose of establishing which the new trial was granted to the defendant, and after hearing all the evidence offered in support of this contention the learned trial judge set aside the evidence of the mortgagor as not worthy of belief when wholly unsupported by other evidence as he found it to be, and the learned judge found as a matter of fact that the market value of the house at the time of the sale was at least $5,000 at which sum it could readily have been sold to other persons, and that the character of the house formed no element in the consideration paid for it and that nothing took place to induce the belief that the purpose of the sale was other than that of turning $5,000 worth of land into that sum of money, and accordingly he rendered judgment for foreclosure in favour of the plaintiff. Against this judgment the appellant appealed, and the judgment having been maintained in the Ontario Courts the case comes before us upon appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nBefore entering into the case of the appellant, who argued his appeal in person, it will be convenient here to notice certain objections taken by the learned counsel for the plaintiff which if well founded go to the root of the right of the appellant to be heard at all upon his appeal. His contention is that since the Administration of Justice Act of 1873, whereby the courts of law and equity were made auxiliary to each other, an action instituted as the present was against the mortgagor and the appellant as purchaser of the mortgaged premises subject to the mortgage had a threefold aspect, and was to be regarded as three separate actions, namely, besides being an action for foreclosure of the mortgage that it was at the same time an action against the mortgagor upon the covenant in the mortgage to pay the mortgage money and as against the appellant an action in the nature of ejectment for recovery simply of possession of the land mortgaged; but neither in the act of 1873 nor in the Ontario Judicature Act, nor in the rules passed by the judges under the authority of that act can I find anything in support of the contention. But on the contrary, rule 341 of the Supreme Court of Judicature puts the question beyond all doubt if any could exist. By that rule, which has the force of an act of the legislature, it is enacted that: No cause of action shall unless by a leave of a court or a judge be joined with an action for the recovery of land except a claim in respect of mesne profits or arrears of rent or double value in respect of the premises claimed or any part thereof and damages for breach of any contract under which the same or any part thereof is held, or for any wrong or injury to the property claimed. And although it is by subsec. (a), of that rule declared that the rule should not prevent a plaintiff in an action for foreclosure or redemption from asking for and obtaining judgment or an order against the defendant for delivery possession of the mortgaged premises to the plaintiff, either forthwith, or on or after a final order for foreclosure or redemption, yet it is there expressly provided that such an action should not be deemed to be an action for the recovery of land within the meaning of the rule. Since the Judicature Act all the courts, no doubt, administer legal and equitable principles in all suits properly framed for the purpose, but the act countenances no such confusion of remedies and principles as the form of action in triplicate suggested would introduce. There are some observations of Lord Justice Cotton in Clements v. Matthews,[18] and Joseph v. Lyons[19] pertinent upon this point. In those cases it was decided that neither detinue nor an action for conversion would lie for the recovery of chattels acquired by a mortgagor after the execution of a chattel mortgage which professed in express terms to pass to the mortgagee after acquired chattels although, as decided in Holroyd v. Marshall[20], equity does give relief in such a case upon a suit properly framed. In the former of the above cases the Lord Justice said:\u2014\nIt is true that every court now administers and deals with the rights of parties having regard to law and equity but the legal position and the equitable position are still different and distinct.\nAnd in the latter he says:\u2014\nIt was not intended that legal and equitable interests should be identical but that the court should administer both legal and equitable principles.\nSuch principles being those applicable to the case as framed.\nThe purpose for which the contention was made was in order to open to the plaintiff this further contention made by her learned counsel, viz.:\u2014that although the plaintiff should fail in obtaining judgment for foreclosure of the mortgage upon the ground that the mortgage was void by reason of illegality in the consideration for which it was executed, still that she might and should have in the action so failing a judgment to recover, as in ejectment, possession of the land comprised in the mortgage so adjudged to be void. This contention is rested upon the judgment in Doe D. Roberts v. Roberts[21], but obtains no support whatever from that judgment which as relied upon in the argument seems to me to have been misunderstood. That action was instituted in pursuance of an order of the Court of Equity Exchequer in Roberts v. Roberts[22]. The bill there was filed by the devisee of one George Roberts for, the purpose of setting aside a deed executed by the testator to the defendant and for a re-conveyance of the premises thereby demised. The deed was alleged in the bill to have been executed to the defendant for the consideration expressed therein of natural love and affection, but that it was in truth executed upon the express promise and assurance of the defendant that the deed when executed should be merely nominal and that as to any beneficial interest in the property the defendant would be a mere trustee of the testator. The bill then alleged that on the execution of the deed the testator delivered it to the defendant and though it had ever since been in his possession yet the testator retained all the title deeds and other writings relating to the property in his own possession, and that neither the defendant nor any other person had ever made use of the deed, nor was the defendant ever in occupation of any part of the property, nor did he in any way derive any advantage from the conveyance, the testator having continued in possession until the time of his death. The defendant in his answer alleged that being for many years much addicted to field sports and not being qualified to kill game he had been threatened with prosecutions, and that he therefore applied to the testator, who was his brother of the half blood, to qualify him which the testator agreed to do, and for that purpose executed the deed mentioned in the bill. The defendant denied however that the deed was executed for the sole purpose of affording him a qualification to kill game, but alleged that the testator in executing the same had it also in view to secure the property to the defendant after testator\u2019s decease. He admitted that no use had ever been made of the deed and that the property had always continued in the possession of the testator. From the evidence it clearly appeared that the intention of the testator in executing the deed was solely to give the defendant a qualification to kill game. The Lord Chief Baron during the argument said:\u2014\nIf the deed be void the plaintiffs want no re-conveyance. They might defend themselves in ejectment and I can render them no assistance.\nAt the close of the argument he said:\u2014\nI do not think that I can interfere in this case without first referring it to a court of law. My present opinion is that it is not void at law.\nThen pronouncing judgment on a subsequent day he said:\u2014\nIt appears that the conveyance was made for the purpose of giving the defendant a qualification to kill game, and I feel myself at a loss to know in what manner I am to grant relief. I don\u2019t think the plaintiffs are entitled to a re-conveyance\u2014the deed was executed maturely\u2014the grantor knew the effect of it. There was no fraud between the brothers, with respect to them the whole transaction was perfectly fair. But it appears by the evidence that the object of the deed was to give to the defendant the appearance of a qualification and that it was executed for no other purpose. That was a fraud on the law and I cannot conceive what right that gives the plaintiffs to come to a court of equity to call for a re-conveyance. It is said nothing was done under the deed, but I cannot see the distinction.\nAnd again:\u2014\nIt appears to me that it is not in the power of equity to call back a deed so given. It has been urged that the deed is void at law and I will not shut out that question. If it be void the plaintiffs have a complete defence at law and I have no objection to retain the bill for a year for the purpose of giving them an opportunity to try that question.\nAccordingly a decree was made whereby the defendant in the equity suit was ordered to proceed to the trial of an action of ejectment which had been stayed by injunction in the equity suit until the hearing and this is the action of ejectment which is reported in 2. B. & Ald. 367. The only object of that trial and the sole question in it was whether or not the deed was void at law. The court entertained no doubt upon the point, and it is difficult to conceive that there could be any. The statute which required all persons killing game to have a certain qualification in real property did not declare any deed executed for the purpose of giving a qualification to kill game to be void; nor even that a deed giving an interest in real property sufficient to give the qualification should be void if executed in pursuance of an agreement that as between the parties to the deed it should be regarded as intended only to give the appearance of qualification for the purpose of protecting the grantee from prosecutions; but that for any other purpose, or as to any beneficial interest in the premises purported to be conveyed by the deed to the grantee, the deed should be deemed to be of no force or effect. As between the parties themselves to the deed it was perfectly good. It was competent to give a good qualification. The only fraud relied upon was one wholly collateral to the deed, namely, that although the deed was competent to give the qualification, yet there was a secret agreement between the parties that it never should be used except to prove the qualification and that it should not be regarded by the grantee as passing to him any beneficial interest, save only to prove his qualification to kill game. Holroyd J. held the case to be similar to that of Hawes v. Loader[23], wherein it was held that as between the parties to a deed it could not be avoided by showing that it was executed for the purpose of defeating creditors, such deeds being only by the \u2018statute made void as against creditors. Abbott C.J. proceeded wholly upon the case of Montefiori v. Montefiori[24], which he held to be expressly in point. Now that case was that a person who had given his brother a promissory note for a large sum of money for the purpose of promoting the brother\u2019s marriage by representing him to be a man of means, could not after the marriage maintain a bill to have the note given up, nor could he defend an action on the note by showing it was given without consideration. Lord Mansfield C.J. rested his judgment upon the following principle; he says:\u2014\nThe law is that where upon proposals of marriage third persons represent anything material in a light different from the truth even though it be by collusion with the husband they shall be bound to make good the thing in the manner in which they represented it. It shall be as represented to be.\nTherefore, in Doe Roberts v. Roberts[25] the grantor having by the deed represented the grantee to be the owner of the property which constituted his qualification to kill game, \u201cit shall be as represented to be,\u201d and the grantor is estopped from proving an agreement to the contrary effect, which if given effect to would be at variance with the deed. The grantee shall hold the property and the grantor shall not be permitted to say that it was agreed that the deed should not pass to the grantee the beneficial estate which it purported to pass. The principle upon which Montefiori v. Montefiori[26] proceeded and which Abbott C.J., made the foundation of his judgment in Doe Roberts v. Roberts25, is thus stated by Lord Chancellor Thurlow, in Neville v. Wilkinson[27]. The Court, he says, proceeded upon the single ground that where one brother has given to another a note for \u00a31,730, to enable him to make a contract of marriage, he could not revoke it. It amounted to a contract to perform what he had done.\nAnd Doe Roberts v. Roberts25 is thus referred to by Sir J. Plumer, Master of the Rolls in Cecil v. Butcher[28].\nIf the deed is complete whether it is a qualification to sit in Parliament or to kill game as in Roberts v. Roberts,[29] the party cannot be heard to allege his own fraudulent purpose, it being a fraud upon the law to attempt to give another a qualification without making him owner of the estate. He is estopped from confining the operation of the deed by averring that he had such a purpose.\nThat is, that the grantee, while having the property conveyed for the purpose of having a qualification, should not be the owner of the estate. The principle of Doe Roberts v. Roberts25 as here explained is that a grantor is estopped from setting up a secret oral agreement to defeat the operation of the express terms of his own deed. In Bessey v. Windham[30] where it was decided that an assignment of goods in fraud of creditors is valid as between the parties to the deed, Lord Denman C.J., delivering judgment, proceeded upon the authority alone of Doe Roberts v. Roberts[31], while in the latter case, as already shown, Holroyd J., proceeded upon the authority of Hawes v. Loader,[32] wherein the same point Was decided as in Bessey v. Windham[33]. These cases, therefore, may well be held to be based upon the same principle, and that the principle of estoppel. So in Phillpotts v. Phillpotts,[34] which was the case of an action of covenant upon an annuity deed, wherein it was held that the defendants\u2019 executors were estopped from pleading that the deed was made fraudulently and collusively between the testator and the plaintiff, for the purpose of multiplying voices, in order to increase the electorate of certain counties at the parliamentary elections therein, and subject to a secret trust and condition that no estate or interest should pass beneficially to the plaintiff by the deed. Jervis C.J. says:\u2014\nIt is to my mind exceedingly difficult to discover any distinction between this case and that of Doe Roberts v. Roberts31. It may be that a deed may be bad so far as concerns the law of Parliament and yet as between the parties it may not be competent for either to set up its invalidity; the very point was discussed where though the jury expressly found that the parties never intended anything to pass by the deed the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held the deed to be operative to convey an interest in the goods upon the principle laid down in Doe Roberts v. Roberts31.\nAnd upon the same principle he maintained that the deed in Phillpotts v. Phillpotts34 might be supported. Williams and Talfourd JJ. concurred that Doe Roberts v. Roberts31 was conclusive upon the point that the defendants, executors of the grantor, were estopped from setting up the secret understanding that the deed should not operate beneficially to the grantee. The same doctrine was affirmed in Bowes v. Foster[35], where Doe Roberts v. Roberts31 was put upon this ground that the transfer was made for the purpose of giving to the transferree a qualification to kill game, and the property therefore passed by the deed, and having passed it was not competent for the defendants claiming under the grantor to allege that the conveyance was made merely to give the semblance of a qualification but in reality upon a secret trust beneficially for the grantor, and that in such a case the transferree in violating the secret agreement was guilty only of a breach of honour and not of a legal obligation. The case of Doe Roberts v. Roberts[36] is plainly referable to the principle that to an action founded upon a deed which as between grantor and grantee passed the property the grantor and those claiming under him are estopped from setting up that the deed was executed upon a secret agreement that it should not operate to give to the grantee the beneficial interest purported by the deed to be given. The principle applied was the same as that applied inter partes in the case of a deed of conveyance of property in fraud of creditors; it therefore can have no application where the defence if established is that the instrument upon which an action is founded was void ab initio as made in violation of the principles of the common law.\nThen it was contended upon the authority of Simpson v. Bloss[37], and other cases which have proceeded upon the authority of that case as Cannan v. Bryce[38], McKinnell v. Robinson[39], and other cases of that class, that the test whether a demand connected with an illegal transaction is capable of being enforced at law is whether the plaintiff requires any aid from the illegal transaction to establish his case; and the contention is, that as the plaintiff is not required in the present action to prove the consideration for the mortgage sought to be foreclosed, but upon proof of the mortgage establishes her case, she cannot be said to require any aid from the illegal transaction to establish it.\nIn Simpson v. Bloss38 the action was in indebitatus assumpsit founded upon mutual promises, where the plaintiff had to prove, in support of his case, the consideration for defendant\u2019s promise sued upon. Cannan v. Bryce39 was in like manner an action in indebitatus assumpsit founded upon mutual promises. At the trial a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a case stated wherein all the circumstances of the transaction were set out, by which it appeared that the defendant\u2019s promise to repay money lent was made upon an illegal consideration, without relying upon which the plaintiff could not recover, and so it was held that he could not recover. McKinnell v. Robertson[40] was also an action in indebitatus assumpsit for money lent, and on account stated; the defendant pleaded to the whole declaration that the money was lent for the purpose of the defendant illegally playing and gaming therewith at the illegal game of hazard. To this plea the plaintiff demurred upon the ground that the plea did not cover the count upon an account stated, but the plea was held to be good and judgment was given accordingly. But in Taylor v. Chester[41] the action was in detinue for half a \u00a350 Bank of England note. Defendant pleaded that the half note was deposited as a pledge in security for a sum of money due from the plaintiff to the defendant, and which was still due and unpaid. To this plea the plaintiff was obliged to reply that the alleged debt in the plea mentioned in justification of detention of the half-note was incurred for wine and suppers supplied by the defendant in a brothel and disorderly house kept by the defendant, for the purpose of being consumed there, etc., etc. There Millar J., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\u2014\nThe true test for determining whether or not the plaintiff and defendant were in pari delicto, is by considering whether the plaintiff could make out his case otherwise than through the medium of the illegal transaction to which he was himself a party.\nAnd he proceeds:\nHad no pleading raised the question of illegality a valid pledge would have been created and a special property conferred upon the defendant in the half-note, and the plaintiff could only have recovered by showing payment or tender of the amount due. In order to get rid of the defence arising from the plea which set up an existing pledge of the half\u2011note the plaintiff had recourse to the special replication, in which he was obliged to set forth the immoral and illegal character of the contract upon which the half-note had been deposited. It was there- fore impossible for him to recover except through the medium, and by the aid, of the illegal transaction to which he was himself a party.\nAnd so it was held that he could not recover being himself in pari delicto.\nWhat is meant in this case, and in all cases as to the application of the test is, that in every case, whether in indebitatus assumpsit or in an action upon a bond, note or other instrument, it appears either by admission on the pleadings, or in the evidence given upon the issues joined upon the pleadings in the case, that the action is connected with an illegal transaction to which the plaintiff was a party, the question arises whether he can or cannot succeed in his action without relying upon the illegal transaction. If he cannot, the action fails; if he can, it prevails. But it never has been held, nor so far as I have been able to find hitherto contended, that in an action upon a note or other instrument in security for money requiring prim\u00e2 facie no evidence of consideration the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon the mere production of the instrument, notwithstanding that the defence is that the instrument sued upon was executed for an illegal consideration in respect of a transaction to which the defendant was himself a party. Such a proposition could not be maintained without reversing a legion of cases from Guichard v. Roberts[42], down to Windhill Board of Health v. Vint[43], which establish that illegality in the consideration of an instrument, whether under seal or not, to enforce which an action is brought, not only may be pleaded, but if it does not appear upon the plaintiff\u2019s own pleading must be pleaded.\nThere remains now the question which was argued by the appellant with much ability, namely, whether he has pleaded and proved sufficient to establish his contention that the mortgage was void ab initio by reason of illegality in the consideration for which it was given.\nIn considering this question a point arises which in view of the very peculiar circumstances of this case cannot be overlooked. The defence is one of which it may be said that it is without a parallel in the reported cases. The appellant purchased from the mortgagor the property mortgaged at what he himself considered to be its fair market value such value being nearly $2,000 in excess of the amount for which the plaintiff had sold the property, and he paid to the mortgagor only the difference between the amount remaining upon the security of the mortgage and the amount so fixed by himself as the value of the property to him purchasing it as he admits he did upon speculation and in the expectation that by reason of the erection of a large public building for a city hall and other purposes of the city of Toronto in the immediate neighbourhood it would become much more valuable as other property which he had purchased in the neighbourhood and had sold at a large advance had proved to be a good speculation. He took from the mortgagor a conveyance of the property subject expressly to the mortgage and to the payment of the sum of $3,700 and interest which in the deeds under which the appellant claims title is stated to be due under the mortgage and by that deed he covenanted with the mortgagor his grantor that he would pay off and discharge the mortgage. By this deed the appellant acquired no legal estate in the mortgaged premises but an equity of redemption therein only, that is to say, the right, by paying the moneys secured by the mortgage, to acquire the legal estate. Upon an action being instituted by the mortgagee to foreclose this mortgage he sets up by way of defence and for the purpose of evading payment of the money secured by the mortgage that the consideration for the execution of the mortgage was illegal and immoral and that the mortgage therefore is void and of no effect. Now the deed executed by the mortgagee conveying the property in fee simple to the mortgagor constituted the consideration for the execution of the mortgage. If then the consideration for the execution of the mortgage was illegal and immoral and the mortgage therefore void, the deed and the estate thereby conveyed which constituted that consideration must be null and void; yet the appellant\u2019s argument before us was to the effect that his succeeding in establishing the mortgage to be void for the reason suggested would be to vest in him the land which he had purchased expressly subject to the mortgage discharged from the mortgage. The case therefore may truly he said to be one sui generis and without parallel in the reported cases. In Holman v. Johnson[44] Lord Mansfield lays down the principle upon which the court proceeds in respect of contracts that are immoral and illegal. As between the parties to the illegal contract, he says:\nThe objection that a contract is immoral and illegal as between plaintiff and defendant sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded on general principles of public policy which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may so say; the principle of public policy is ex dolo malo non oritur actio.\nNow, here it is to be observed: 1st. That the language is applied as between the immediate parties to the illegal or immoral contract, who, in the case of such a contract, are in pari delicto, and the test as to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery where such a defence is set up by the other party to the contract is whether the plaintiff is or is not in pari delicto with the defendant. It does, I must say, seem to me to be an unwarranted extension of the rule so laid down by Lord Mansfield, not supported by any decided case, to apply it to the case of a mortgagee seeking to foreclose a mortgage given to secure purchase money of land sold by the mortgagee, against a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for valuable consideration from the original vendee, whose deed of conveyance from such vendee subjects the premises and the estate therein transferred to such purchaser, in express terms, to payment of the mortgage and the moneys secured thereby. And it is to be observed, 2nd. That in order to procure the court to abstain from enforcing a contract upon its face perfectly good and for valuable consideration the objection must be taken by the defendant. Now, although when properly taken as required by the recognized course of proceedings in the particular action, and established by legal evidence, the court does not act in the interest of, or for the sake of, the defendant making the objection, but upon principles of public policy, by which the defendant may obtain an advantage over the plaintiff, contrary to the real justice of the case, and so by accident, as it were, yet before he can obtain such even accidental advantage against the real justice of the case he must take the objection by a plea specially stating the particular facts relied upon as constituting the immorality or illegality, so that the court may see upon the record that the facts pleaded, if proved, do constitute illegality in the contract or instrument sued upon; and also in order that the evidence offered in support of the plea may be confined to the particular facts so pleaded. No public policy would justify a court in withholding its aid to enforce a deed executed upon its face for good and valuable consideration, except upon its being shown by the facts specially pleaded and proved in the action wherein the deed is sought to be enforced, that it is void as illegal or immoral. Prior to the passing of the Judicature Act the invariable rule was that the facts relied upon as constituting the illegality relied upon as a defence to an action upon a contract must be specially pleaded. In Colborne v. Stockdale[45] it was held that a plea of illegality in a bond, that it was given for money won at play, ought to state at what game, that it was like a usurious or simoniacal contract where the agreement must be shown, for that it was matter of law and that the court should have the means of judging whether the facts stated constituted illegality; and in Mazzinghi v. Stephenson[46], it was held that a plaintiff was entitled to recover upon such a bond where the defendant failed to prove that the money for which the bond was given was won at the particular game stated in the plea, viz., \u201cfaro.\u201d To the like effect as to the necessity of particularity in the statement of the facts relied upon as constituting illegality are Hill v. Montagu[47]; Potts v. Sparrow[48]; Martin v. Smith[49]; Fenwick v. Laycock[50]; Cooke v. Stratford[51]; Allport v. Nutt[52]; and Grizewood v. Blane[53]. In this latter case the court unanimously held that the facts relied upon as making the contract illegal must be specially pleaded; that illegality must not be stated by simple, inexplicit allegation, but that the plea should contain an allegation of facts which would enable the court to say whether or not they constituted illegality, and for that purpose that the facts should be expanded on the record.\nNow the Judicature Act has made no difference in this respect for by rule 399 of the General Rules passed under the authority of the act it is enacted that pleadings shall contain a concise statement of the material facts upon which the party pleading relies. Under a similar rule in England it was decided, in Hanmer v. Flight[54], that the facts from which the court is to judge the result must be stated. So a statement of claim which merely alleged that a good donatio causa mortis had been made to the plaintiff without stating the facts relied upon as constituting the donation was held bad[55]. The form of setting up the defence as invariably used in practice under the Judicature Act appears from the statement of defence in Windhill Board of Health v. Vint[56].\nThe plea of the appellant which merely alleged that the consideration for the execution of the mortgage in the statement of claim mentioned was illegal and immoral was a bad plea as presenting no facts relied upon as constituting illegality or immorality. It is true that the plaintiff did not take any objection to the plea for this defect; but when after a regular judgment of foreclosure in favour of the plaintiff in the action the appellant applied to the court for a special indulgence to be granted to him, namely, that the regular judgment should be set aside and a new trial given to him to enable him to prove that $2,000 of the purchase money for the house sold by the plaintiff to the mortgagor, and for securing which the mortgage was given, was for what has been called the good-will of the house, or a value attached to it as a house of ill\u2011fame, and that the residue of the purchase money or $2,000 was the agreed value of the premises irrespective of such so called good-will; and when he accepted the new trial upon condition of paying the balance of the money remaining due upon the security of the mortgage and availed himself of the special indulgence so granted to him, and went down to try the truth of the allegation as to the $2,000\u2014part of the purchase money\u2014and wholly failed to establish the matter alleged in respect thereof, no principle of law or public policy requires the court to entertain a further objection made ore tenus, not set out on the record, namely, that in the evidence offered to establish the contention to try which alone the appellant was granted the indulgence of setting aside a regular judgment, and in which he failed, it sufficiently appeared that the person to whom the house was sold by the plaintiff, and by purchase from whom the appellant claims, was to the knowledge of the plaintiff a prostitute, and that the plaintiff knew or had reason to know or believe that the purchaser of the house intended when the house should be conveyed to her to continue to lead therein her dissolute and immoral life. \u201cWhether these facts, assuming them to be established, would or would not make void the mortgage given to secure part of the purchase money bon\u00e2 fide agreed upon as being the fair marketable value of the house, I can see no principle of law or public policy requiring the court to relax the rules of law governing the mode of presenting a defence of that kind to an action upon a mortgage given for such purchase money for the purpose of permitting the appellant, after judgment against him upon the point upon which alone the court granted the new trial, to raise such new contention. In my opinion, however, the cases relied upon by the appellant do not support this new contention assuming it to be open to him.\nIn Lloyd v. Johnson[57], where the action was for work and labour bestowed by the plaintiff in washing clothes for a prostitute, which were used by her for the purpose of appearing in public places in pursuit of her immoral calling, the plaintiff having knowledge of her being a prostitute, and of the purpose to which the articles washed were applied, it was held that such \u2018 knowledge did not disentitle the plaintiff to recover for his work and labour.\nIn Lightfoot v. Tenant[58] the plea to an action on a money bond alleged that the bond was given for the price of goods sold by the plaintiff to the defendant for a purpose the facts of which were specially stated, and which were contrary to the provisions of an act of Parliament, and the plea being proved it was held that the plaintiff could not recover.\nIn Paxton v. Popham[59], to an action on a bond, a plea that the bond was given to cover the price of goods illegally (stating the facts constituting the illegality) contracted to be sold and shipped in contravention of an act of Parliament, was held upon demurrer to be a good plea in bar of the action.\nIn Bowry v. Bennet[60], in an action for the value of clothes furnished to the defendant, the defence was that the defendant was, as was well known to the plaintiff, a woman of the town and that the clothes were furnished to her for the purpose of enabling her to carry on her business of prostitution. Lord Ellenborough held that the plaintiff must not only be shown to have had notice of the defendant\u2019s way of life but that he had expected to be paid from the profits of defendant\u2019s prostitution, and that he had sold the clothes to enable her to carry it on, and the plaintiff recovered.\nIn Hodgson v. Temple[61] Lord Mansfield held that the mere selling goods knowing that the buyer would make an illegal use of them is not sufficient to deprive the vendor of the right of just payment. In Langton v. Hughes[62] the case was of drugs sold with the knowledge that they were bought for the purposes of being used in a manner prohibited by act of Parliament, and it was held that as the act also expressly prohibited the causing or procuring the drugs to be so used, the sale with knowledge that the goods were bought for the purpose of being so used was a causing or procuring them to be so used within the prohibition in the act, and that therefore the plaintiff could not recover the price of goods so sold.\nIn Cannan v. Bryce[63] the plea was that the money sued for was lent for the express purpose of enabling the defendant to pay certain losses incurred in illegal stock jobbing transactions; and it was held that the plaintiff could not recover money lent for the express purpose of accomplishing an illegal object.\nIn McKinnell v. Robinson[64], to an action of indebitatus assumpsit for money lent, the plea was that the money was lent for the purpose of defendant illegally playing and gaming therewith at hazard. On demurrer the plea was held a good plea in bar, upon the principle, \u201cnot for the first time\u201d (as said by Lord Abinger on delivering judgment) \u201claid down but fully settled in the case of Cannan v. Bryce64 namely that the repayment of a sum of money lent for the express purpose of accomplishing an illegal object and of enabling the borrowers to do a prohibited act cannot be enforced.\nIn Jennings v. Throgmorton[65] the action was in assumpsit for the use and occupation of rooms let to defendant as weekly tenant. After the tenant entered the plaintiff became aware that she lived by prostitution. Abbott C.J. charged the jury that if the plaintiff after he became aware of the defendant\u2019s mode of living suffered her to occupy the premises for the express pur- pose of continuing a life of prostitution, and that the demand sued for accrued afterwards, he could not recover.\nIn Gas Light Co. v. Turner[66] in an action upon the covenant in a lease for payment of rent the plea was that the premises were demised for express purpose of violating an act of Parliament in the manner specially stated in the plea\u2014upon demurrer the plea was held to be good, Tindal C.J. saying:\u2014\nThe allegation that the tenements and premises were demised to the defendant for the express purpose, &c., &c., necessarily implies and even in a more especial manner declares that the express purpose was the purpose of the party who made the demise viz., the plaintiff.\nAnd with reference to an argument urged on behalf of the plaintiff that if the defendant should succeed on the plea the consequence would follow that he could hold the premises for the whole term granted by the lease free from rent he answered:\u2014\nIf an ejectment were brought by the lessors to recover possession on the ground that the lease was void it would be difficult for the lessee to maintain his right to hold under the lease after having pleaded in the present action that the indenture was void and obtained the judgment of the court in his favour on that plea.\nIn Ritchie v. Smith[67] the action was in assumpsit for the use and occupation by the defendant of certain premises under a written agreement; plea that the agreement, setting it out at length, was made for the express purpose of enabling one of the defendants, party to the agreement, to contravene the provisions of a statute passed for the protection of public morals, showing the manner of contravention. The facts alleged in the plea being proved it was held that the plaintiff could not recover, Williams J. saying:\u2014\nThis is an agreement by which the plaintiff co-operated with other persons for the avowed purpose of contravening and evading the pro- visions of an act having for its object the protection and advancement of public safety and morals.\nIn Smith v. White[68] the question arose in relation to a lease of premises which had been used as a brothel. Kindersley V.C., proceeded upon the cases of Jennings v. Throgmorton[69] and Bowry v. Bennet[70], in which latter case, however, he is erroneously reported to have said that the plaintiff was held to be not entitled to recover. In his judgment, however, he rests upon the same principle which enabled the plaintiff to succeed in Bowry v. Bennet71 and the defendant in Jennings v. Throgmorton70. He there says\u2014\nIt cannot be doubted that in the present case the plaintiff knew that the means of paying the high rent which was to be paid for the premises would be derived from the profits of the immoral trade carried on in the house, and although he had no lien on these profits he expected to be paid out of them, and knew that unless the tenant carried on such trade he would not be able to pay the rent.\nIn Feret v. Hill[71], with reference to a lease of premises acquired by a lessee with the intention of using the premises as a brothel, it is said that no intention existing in the lessee\u2019s mind could make the lease void.\nIn Pearce v. Brooks[72], in an action for the use of a brougham had under an agreement between plaintiff and defendant for the purpose, the plea was that the agreement was made for the supply of a brougham to be used by her as a prostitute, which she was known to the plaintiff to be, and to assist her, as the plaintiff also well knew, in carrying on her immoral vocation. The question was as to whether the evidence supported the plea. At the trial Bramwell B., put the case to the jury thus:\u2014\nThat in some sense everything which was supplied to a prostitute is supplied to her to enable her to carry on her trade, as, for instance\u00bb shoes sold to a street walker, and that the things supplied must not be merely such as would be necessary or useful for ordinary purposes, and also be applied to an immoral purpose, but that they must be such as would, under the circumstances, not be required except with that view.\nAnd he submitted certain questions to the jury which they answered by finding that the brougham was used by the defendant as part of her display to attract men, and that the plaintiff knew it was supplied to be used for that purpose. Upon this finding a verdict was entered for the defendant, with leave for the plaintiff to enter a verdict for him for 15 guineas. Upon the argument of a motion to that effect it was held that the finding of the jury supported the allegation in the plea that the brougham was supplied to the defendant to be used by her as a prostitute, and to assist her in carrying on her immoral vocation. During the argument Bramwell B., after stating what his charge had been, as above, added:\nThe jury, by the mode in which they answered the question, showed that they appreciated the distinction, and on reflection I think they were entitled to draw the inference which they did. They were entitled to bring their knowledge of the world to bear on the facts proved. The inference that a prostitute (who swore that she could not read writing) required an ornamental brougham for the purpose of her calling, was as natural a one as that a medical man would want a brougham for the purpose of visiting his patients, and the knowledge of the defendant\u2019s condition being brought home to the plaintiffs, the jury were entitled to ascribe to them also the knowledge of her purpose, which, being established, was sufficient to support the allegation in the plea, to the effect that the brougham was supplied by the plaintiffs to the defendant to be used by her as a prostitute, and to assist her in carrying on her immoral vocation.\nSo regarding the case Pollock C.B. says[73]:\u2014\nIf evidence is given which is sufficient to satisfy the jury of the fact of the immoral purpose and of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of it and that the article was required and furnished to facilitate that object, it is sufficient.\nAnd Martin B. says:\u2014 The real question is whether sufficient has been found by the jury to make a legal defence to the action under the third plea.\nThen stating the substance of that plea he adds:\u2014\nIf therefore there is evidence that the brougham was to the knowledge of the plaintiffs hired for the purpose of such display as would assist the defendant in her immoral occupation the substance of the plea is proved and the contract was illegal.\nAnd he added:\u2014\nAs to Cannan v. Bryce[74] I have a strong impression that it has been questioned to this extent that if money is lent the lender merely handing it over into the absolute control of the borrower, although he may have reason to suppose that it will not be employed illegally he will not be disentitled from recovering. But no doubt if it were part of the contract that the money should be so supplied the contract would be illegal.\nThis language implies that the learned Baron considered that the evidence that the plaintiff knew that the defendant was a prostitute and that she hired the brougham to be used by her in attracting men and in assisting her to carry on her immoral vocation, for which purpose alone in her condition in life she could have been supposed to require such an article, was equivalent to a contract for the letting by the plaintiff of the brougham to her for that purpose. And so Pollock C.B., agreeing with what had fallen from Martin B. as to the case of Cannan v. Bryce,75 says[75]:\u2014\nIf a person lends money but with a doubt in his mind whether it is actually to be applied to an illegal purpose it will be a question for the jury whether he meant it to be so applied, but if it were advanced in such a way that it could not possibly be a bribe to an illegal purpose and afterwards it was turned to that use neither Cannan v. Bryce75 nor any other case decides that this act would be illegal.\nThen Pigott B. said:\u2014\nI think that the jury were entitled to call in aid their knowledge of the usages of the day to interpret the facts proved before them. If a woman who is known to be a prostitute wants an ornamental brougham there can be very little doubt for what purpose she requires it. It can- not be necessary that the plaintiff should look to the proceeds of the immoral act for payment, the law would indeed be blind if it supported a contract where the parties were silent as to the mode of payment, and refused to support a similar contract in the rare case where the parties were imprudent enough to express it. The plaintiff knew the woman\u2019s mode of life and where the means of payment would come from.\nThese observations were applied to an allegation in the plea, that the agreement for letting the brougham was made by the plaintiffs in the expectation that the defendant would pay the plaintiffs the moneys to be paid by the agreement out of her receipts, of which expectation being entertained by the plaintiffs there was no express evidence, but as it would seem, sufficient evidence in the opinion of the learned Baron from which that inference if it had been necessary might have been drawn. The judgment in this case does not extend the principle involved in Cannan v. Bryce[76], The Gas Light Co. v. Turner[77], or any other of the cases above cited. It merely lays down the rule that for the purpose of proving an allegation in a plea that an article for the price or use of which an action is brought was supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant to be used by her in the pursuit of an illegal and immoral purpose, and to assist her in accomplishing such illegal and immoral purpose, the jury should take into consideration the nature of the article supplied and the condition in life of the person to whom it was supplied, and the question whether the article supplied was such as under the circumstances in evidence might be required for some necessary purpose other than the illegal purpose, or on the contrary could only be required for such illegal purpose, and that in order to enable them to draw a proper inference from the facts in evidence they were entitled to apply their knowledge of the world as bearing upon those facts, and, it having been proved that the plaintiffs knew the defendant to whom they had let an ornamental brougham to be a prostitute, were, in the exercise of their knowledge of the world, justified in finding that the plaintiffs who supplied the brougham to the defendant knew that it was supplied by them to be used by her as part of her display as a prostitute and to attract men. The judgment of the court in the case is that such finding proved the plea, and so in effect was equivalent to an express finding that the brougham was let as alleged in the plea to be so used, that is to say for the purpose of being so used by the defendant, and so the case came within Cannan v. Bryce[78], Gas Light Co. v. Turner[79], and other similar cases.\nIn Fisher v. Bridges[80] in the Exchequer Chamber it was pleaded and proved that the bond upon which the action was brought was given to secure payment of the consideration money for lands sold and conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendant for the express purpose of being sold, and upon an express agreement entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant that the lands so conveyed should be sold, by the defendant by lottery in contravention of two acts of Parliament by which not only were all lotteries prohibited, but all sales of houses, lands, &c., by lottery were declared to be absolutely void.\nNow the principles involved in, and to be collected from, all of the above cases are as it appears to me\u2014\n1st. That a plea setting up as a defence to an action upon a contract entered into or an instrument under seal or in writing without seal executed by the defendant, that the contract or instrument upon which the action is founded was executed for an illegal or immoral purpose or consideration must state the particular facts relied upon as establishing the illegality or immorality, and must not merely make the inexplicit allegation that the contract was entered into or the instrument executed upon or for an illegal or immoral purpose or consideration.\n2nd. That all contracts entered into between a plaintiff and defendant and all instruments executed for the purpose of passing property from the former to the latter, with the intent and for the purpose, operating in the mind of the transferor, that the property transferred shall be applied by the transferree in the accomplishment of a purpose which is in contravention of the principles of the common law or the provisions of a statute, are void and incapable of being enforced by either of the parties against the other upon the illegality being made to appear in due form of law in an action upon the contract or instrument, and that an instrument executed by the transferee for the purpose of securing to the transferor payment of the consideration money for the property so transferred is in like manner void and incapable of being enforced by the transferor against the transferree upon the illegality being made to appear in like manner.\n3rd. Knowledge in the mind of the transferor that the transferee intended to apply the property when transferred to him to an illegal purpose will not avoid a contract between the parties or an instrument which transfers the property from the one to the other unless, having regard to the particular nature of the property transferred, and to the condition in life and occupation of the person to whom it is transferred, a just inference can be drawn from the facts in evidence that the property was so transferred with the intent and for the purpose, operating in the mind of the transferor, that the property when transferred should be applied by the transferee to the illegal purpose alleged in the plea.\nApplying these principles to the present case I am of opinion, for all of the reasons above stated, that the appellant has wholly failed in establishing that the deed executed by the plaintiff to the appellant\u2019s grantor, and which constitutes the consideration for the execution of the mortgage sued upon and the root of the appellant\u2019s title to the premises mortgaged, is void. If the contention of the appellant should prevail I cannot see that it would be possible for any of these unfortunate creatures who lead a life similar to that led by the appellant\u2019s grantor to enter into any contract with any person knowing her character for the purchase in fee of a house to shelter her or for the purchase of any of the necessaries of life; and the golden rule laid down in Pearce v. Brooks[81] upon which case the appellant so much relied would be utterly ignored and set at naught, namely\u2014that it is necessary in cases like the present to distinguish between such things as, while being necessary or useful for the ordinary purposes of life, may also be applied to an immoral purpose, and those which are such as under the circumstances in evidence would appear not to be required except for an immoral purpose. No such principle has yet been laid down, or is sanctioned, by any of the decided cases, and there is not in my opinion any principle of law or of public morals or of christian morality which could sanction the affirmation of such a principle.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appellant has, in my opinion, made a strong, a very strong case. Mr. Justice Meredith\u2019s remarks in the Divisional Court, also, it seems to me, support the appellant\u2019s legal propositions. I dissent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAppellant in person: R.S.

(1) that the answers contained in the application contained a true statement of the manner in which the business was conducted and accounts kept and that they would be so kept, and (2) that the employers should immediately upon its becoming known to them, give notice to the guarantors that the employee had become guilty of any criminal offence entailing or likely to entail loss to the employers and for which a claim was liable to be made under the policy. There was a defalcation in W.'s. accounts and the evidence showed that no proper supervision had been exercised over W.'s books and the guarantors were not notified until a week after employers had full knowledge of the defalcation and W. had left the country.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as the employers had not exercised the stipulated supervision over W. and had not given immediate notice of the defalcation they were not entitled to recover under the policy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing appellants' action with costs.\nThis was an action upon two contracts of guarantee as to the fidelity of Mr. H. D. \"Whitney, formerly secretary-treasurer of the Harbour Board of Montreal, who absconded in June 1887 being a defaulter in an amount exceeding that covered by the two contracts of guarantee.\nThe plea set up in effect the grounds:\u2014\nThat in 1877 the then chairman of the Harbour Commissioners made an employer's proposal, which was to form the basis of the contract of guarantee and thereby answered certain questions which were declared to be true and the supervision named therein was to be duly observed by the plaintiffs, and that the appellants, relying upon the truth of all the answers and representations, entered into the contract.\nThe following are the questions and answers, as set out;\nIn what capacity do you require this security from him, and from when do you wish this security to date?\nWhen and how often will his accounts be balanced and closed?\nWill the cash and securities appearing to your credit at each balancing time be examined and verified, and if so, by whom?\nPlaintiffs answered in words following:\u2014\nHe acts as assistant-secretary; first November; books balanced every month and closed at the 31st December each year cash, etc. examined by auditors.\nWhat is the greatest amount of money or negotiable or convertible securities which will at one time be in his custody? Please state how long such amounts will remain under his control and whether all such moneys and securities are deposited in the bank daily, or how and by whose authority will they be drawn out?\nAnswer Custom is to deposit in bank frequently every few days; drawn out by cheque signed by chairman and by order of Finance Committee. Thee plea also alleged: \u2014\nThat it was a condition of the policy that it should only remain in force so long as the contract by the said declaration created should be strictly performed and observed by the employer.\nThat it was also stipulated that the policy was granted upon the express condition that the answers contained in the declaration contained a true statement of the manner in which the business was conducted, and accounts kept; and that the business should be so continued to be conducted, and accounts so kept, and proper supervision exercised and that the policy should not extend to cover any loss by reason of neglect or omission but only of the fraud and dishonesty of the employee. And the respondents averred that the answers and representations were false.\nThat another condition of the policy was that every description of aid and assistance (not pecuniary) for the purpose of bringing an offender to justice should be given by the employer, and the employer should immediately, upon its becoming known to him that the employee had been guilty of a criminal offence, give notice so as to give the directors an opportunity of instituting legal proceedings.\nThat the appellants neglected to give immediate notice of the criminal offences charged against Whitney, and refused to aid the respondents in bringing Whitney to justice and failed to notify them as required by the provisions of the policy.\nThat they thereby forfeited all claims under the policy of guarantee.\nThe evidence in the case is reviewed in the report of the case in the court below and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nAbbott Q.C. for appellants, contended that in a contract of suretyship the appellants statements, even if incorporated in the contract, are not warranties. The appellants were not bound to carry them out on pain of absolute forfeiture of their rights. They are statements of a course of conduct intended to be pursued and that only. Unless they could show fraud or collusion even the non-observance of the course of conduct independently of the observance of this course of con duct does not vitiate the contract North British v. Lloyd ([2]). Cites also Towle v. National Guardian Assurance Co. ([3]); American Surety Co, v. Thurber ([4]); Let Banque Nationale y. LE Esperance ([5]); Benham v. United Guarantee and Life Assurance Co. ([6]).\nGeoffrion Q.O. and Cross for respondents, contended that the notice was given after defalcation was known and not until the respondents thought it was too late to arrest Whitney, and that Whitney's books had not been balanced, as the agreement distinctly expressed, and that they had violated the essential conditions of the guarantee bond.\u2014Commercial Building Society v.

Un second contrat de m\u00eame nature est intervenu entre les m\u00eames parties le 1er novembre 1882.\nPendant qu'il \u00e9tait au service des appelants et dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses devoirs, comme assistant secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et comme secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier depuis son entr\u00e9e en office jusqu'au 30 juin 1887, le dit Whitney est devenu d\u00e9ficitaire et a laisse le pays avec un d\u00e9ficit dans sa caisse de $8,000.\nLes appelants ont alors donn\u00e9 avis \u00e0 la compagnie du d\u00e9ficit et out porte contre l'intim\u00e9e une action r\u00e9clamant $5,000, le montant des deux polices de garantie.\nAvec l'action, les deux polices et une lettre de Alexander Robertson, pr\u00e9sident des demandeurs appelants, furent produites. Cette lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Edward Rawlings, le g\u00e9rant de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, en date du 29 septembre 1887, contenait un \u00e9tat de la d\u00e8flcation commise par Whitney.\nL'existence de la d\u00e9falcation est hors de doute. La d\u00e9fense se base uniquement sur les conditions du contrat il s'agit de savoir si ces conditions sont suffisantes pour autoriser la compagnie \u00e0 repousser une demande fond\u00e9e pour perte r\u00e9elle occasionn\u00e9e par l'infid\u00e9lit\u00e9 de Whitney, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'une perte contre laquelle les appelants se sont pourvus par les conditions du contrat de garantie.\nLa defense all\u00e8gue qu'en 1877, le pr\u00e8sident de la commission du havre fit \u00e0 la compagnie une proposition qui devait \u00eatre la b\u00e2se d'un contrat de garantie et donna \u00e0 certaines questions des r\u00e9ponses qu'il d\u00e8clara vraies, et que la survelilaance mentionn\u00e9e dans ces questions serait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement exerc\u00e9e par les appelants, que l'intim\u00e8e se fiant sur lav\u00e8rit\u00e8 de ces r\u00e8ponses etrepr\u00e8sentations consentit \u00e0 donner les dites polices de grarantie ([10]).\nPar la seconde police du ler novembre 1882 il \u00e8tait stipule qu'une surveillance active serait exerc\u00e9e sur l'employ\u00e9, et sur l'ex\u00e9cution de toutes les r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements et que s'il y avait quelque changement important dans les devoirs de l'employ\u00e9, la compagnie intim\u00e9e en serait avertie qu'elle le serait aussi dans le cas ou l'employ\u00e9 commettrait d'autres infractions aux r\u00e8glements ou qu'\u00e0 la connaissance des appelants il s'engagerait dans des entreprises de speculations ou d'une nature dangereuse.\nPar une autre condition il \u00e8tait stipul\u00e8 que si l'employ\u00e8 devenait d\u00e8falcataire dans des circonstances-pou-vant donner lieu \u00e0 une poursuite criminelle les appelants prendraient imm\u00e9diatement tous les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour faire arr\u00eater l'empoy\u00e9 pendant l'enqu\u00eate sur sa conduite et en avertiraient la compagnie.\nLa defence all\u00e8gue aussi que les appelants out n\u00e9gli\u00e9\u00e9 d'exercer sur Whitney une surveillance diligente dans l'exercice de ses devoirs et n'ont pris aucune des pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour se pr\u00e9munir contre la d\u00e8falcation de Whitney, laquelle n'est que le r\u00e9sultat de leur faute et negligence.\nQue les dits appelants, longtemps avant la fuite de Whitney et avant d'en avoir averti l'intim\u00e9e connaissaient ses malversations et ont toujours n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'en avertir l'intim\u00e9e e qu'ils out aussi neglig\u00e9 de lui donner imm\u00e9diatement avis de l'affaire criminelle port\u00e8e contre lui et refuse d'aider l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intime\u00e8 \u00e0 justice.\nAinsi qu'on le voit par les conditions ci-dessus rapport\u00e9es le contrat ne devait pas avoir d'effet \u00e0 moins que les appelants n'eussent ex\u00e8cut\u00e9 les obligations qui'ls avaient assum\u00e9es envers l'intim\u00e9e et dont ils avaient garanti l'ex\u00e9cution.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e8geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e8ala donn\u00e9 gain de cause aux appelants, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 en cour d'appel sur le principe que la preuve a \u00e9tabli qu'ils n'avaient pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 leurs obligations envers l'intim\u00e9e. En effet,. les livres de compte de Whitney, au lieu d'\u00eatre balances tous les mois comme l'avait dit le pr\u00e9sident Robertson dans ses r\u00e9ponses ne l'\u00e9taient Qu'une fois l'ann\u00e9e, et pour les ann\u00e9es 1884 et 1885, ils ne l'ont ete qu'une seule fois pour ces deux ann\u00e8es.\nLe pr\u00e9sident des commissaires M. Robertson, dit qu'il n'a jamais examine la caisse de Whitney.\nA I never looked, into his cash I did. not consider it my duty to look into his cash. It was not my special duty. I never counted his ' cash. It was a matter for the auditor to do.\nQu'il n'a jamais examine les compets de Whitney avant sa fuite; admet qu'il n'y a eu qu'une audition des comptes pour les ann\u00e9es 1884 et 1885; qu'il n'a jamais v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les balances consid\u00e9rables port\u00e9es au credit, n'a jamais v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 non plus l'argent en caisse, et n'avait aucune m\u00e9thode de contr\u00f4ler les entr\u00e9es du livre de caisse qu'il laissait tout cela \u00e0 l'auditeur qu'il ne lisait pas non plus les lettres re\u00e7ues.\nUn cheque de $14,000 du gouvernement pour le compte des phares et des bou\u00e9es, en date du 11 juin 1886, a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par M. Whitney ainsi qu'il l'a reconnu dans une lettre entr\u00e9e au livre des lettres en date du 19 juin. Ce montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 par Whitney, mais la d\u00e9couverte n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que le 30 juin de l'ann\u00e9e suivante, le jour de sa fuite.\nLe pr\u00e9sident n'a jamais eu le livret de banque et ne l'a jamais compar\u00e9 avec le livre de caisse. Personne n'\u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de la surveillance des comptes de Whitney.\nIl \u00e8tait tenu un livre pour l'enregistrement des obligations (bonds), mais ce livre n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par personne dans l'office.\nM. Cameron associ\u00e9 de M. Riddell, l'auditeur des appelants, qui a fait presque tout I'ouvrage de l'audition dit: qu'aucun examen des comptes de Whitney n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait depuis le commencement de 1884 jusqu'au commencement de 1885. Il dit aussi que le livre de caisse n'\u00e9tait pas balanc\u00e9 tous les mois et probablement pas m\u00eame tous les trois mois. En suivant une semblable m\u00e9thode, ajoute Cameron, il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de constater une d\u00e9falcation avant la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\nDes le mois de mai ou juin 1887, Whitney avait commis une d\u00e9falcation, par la soustraction d'une obligation de $500 \u00e0 $600 qu'il avait r\u00e9alis\u00e9e et d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e \u00e0 son profit. Aussi \u00e0 bonne heure que le 17 on 22 juin ce fait \u00e9tait connu des auditeurs Riddell et Cameron ainsi que du pr\u00e9sident des commissaires.\nCameron dit aussi qu'aucune entr\u00e9e n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite an graudlivre depuis six mois. Tous les t\u00e9moins qui en parlent, disent que la caisse n'\u00e9tait pas compt\u00e9e tous les mois et en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pas plus de deux fois dans l'ann\u00e9e. Cameron dit que la d\u00e9falcation eut \u00e9t\u00e9 probablement connue plus tot, si la caisse e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 balanc\u00e9e tous les mois, mais elle ne l'\u00e9tait que rarement pas m\u00eame tons les quatre mois.\nD'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Riddell, la caisse n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 balanc\u00e9e que tous les six mois pendant les trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, qu'il n'y a pas en d'examens mensuels ni de v\u00e9rification des fonds en caisse, qu'elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 balanc\u00e9e que le 5 janvier 1887, et ne l'a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite jusqu'au 30 juin, apr\u00e8s la fuite de Whitney.\nD'apr\u00e8s Cameron, des balances consid\u00e9rables non collect\u00e9es-\u00e9taient rapport\u00e9es d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e, et que ceci, ajout\u00e9 a la n\u00e9gligence avec laquelle la caisse \u00e9tait tenue et l'absence de tout contr\u00f4le sur l'\u00e9mission des debentures, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 si irr\u00e9gulier que les auditeurs avaient jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos dans l'automne de 1886 d'en pr\u00e9venir Whitney et le pr\u00e9sident lui-m\u00eame et de recommander l'adoption d'un nouveau syst\u00e8me qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9.\nDans le mois d'avril 1887, Cameron avait eu connaissance du d\u00e9tournement d'une somme de cinq a six cents piastres, produit d'une obligation que Whitney avait r\u00e9alis\u00e9. Le 17 ou le 22 juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e Riddell et le pr\u00e9sident eurent connaissance du d\u00e9tournement de la somme de cinq ou six cents piastres produit d'une obligation des commissaires. Le 29 juin Riddell \u00e9crivit au pr\u00e9sident au sujet du d\u00e9tournement de l'obligation et le 29 lui \u00e9crivit encore pour lui dire que Witney \u00e8tait d\u00e9ficitaire pour un montant consid\u00e9rable. Le lendemain Whitney s'\u00e9tait enfui. Malgr\u00e9 toutes ces preuves de la d\u00e9falcation de Whitney aucun avis n'en fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Au contraire Riddell qui \u00e9tait convaincu depuis le 17 ou 22 juin de la d\u00e9falcation de Whitney, discutant le sujet avec le pr\u00e9sident des commissaires fut \u00e9tonn\u00e9 et m\u00eame alarm\u00e9 de voir celui-ci accorder huit jours de d\u00e9lai \u00e0 Whitney pour remettre ses affaires en ordre. il lui dit aussi que la compagnie intim\u00e9e devait \u00eatre notifi\u00e9e, et que quelqu'un devrait passer la nuit avec Whitney. Ceci se passait peu apr\u00e8s quatre heures p. m. il revit le pr\u00e9sident ensuite vers cinq heures, mais il avait alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas donner avis a la compagnie;\nNon-seulement les appelants ont manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 leur obligation d'avetir l'intim\u00e9e, mais le lendemain apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de Whitney, le pr\u00e9sident h\u00e9sita pendant si longtemps \u00e0 donner son consentement pour son arrestation que Whitney eut le temps de s'enfuir. Rawlings, le g\u00e9rante l'intim\u00e9e se rendit avec un d\u00e9fectif au bureau des appelants, pour demander le consentement de M. Robertson pour l'arrestation, mais celuici tarda si longtemps \u00e0 le donner que l'on apprit que le train qu'avait pris Whitney \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Prescott et que Whitney s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9chapp\u00e9.\nL'obligation de surveiller Whitney dans ses proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ne s'appliquait pas seulement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re police de garantie comme assistant secr\u00e9taire mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 celle de secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier. Pans cette seconde police il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence par son num\u00e9ro \u00e0 la proposition des appelants et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 quelle est \u00e9mise sur les repr\u00e9sentations contenues dans ce document et sur la d\u00e9claration que les r\u00e9ponses sont vraies et sur la promesse que la m\u00eame surveillance sera exerc\u00e9e sur Whitney dans son nouvel office de secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier que dans celui d'assistant secr\u00e9taire qu'il exer\u00e7ait auparavant. il ne peut pas y avoir de doute que la proposition des appelants s'applique aussi bien \u00e0 la seconde qu'\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re police et que leur obligation quant \u00e0 la surveillance est parfaitement \u00e9tablie.\nLa Cour du Banc de la Reine est tout-\u00e0-fait fond\u00e9e sur la preuve lorsqu'elle d\u00e9clare que les appelants n'ont pas exerc\u00e9 sur leur employ\u00e9 Whitney la surveillance \u00e0 laquelle ils s'\u00e9taient engages par les polices d'assurances \u00e9mises par l'intim\u00e9e; qu'ils ne lui ont point accord\u00e9 toute l'aide et l'assistance qu'ils \u00e9taient tenus de lui donner d'apr\u00e8s les conditions des dites polices, qu'ils ne lui ont donn\u00e9 aucun avis des d\u00e9falcations de Whitney dont ils avaient connaissance depuis longtemps et que leur manque de diligence \u00e0 faire arr\u00eater Whitney a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause qu'il a pu \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la justice. Que ces violations des engagements des appelants sont suffisantes pour d\u00e9gager l'intim\u00e9e de toute responsabilit\u00e9 envers eux. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9, ainsi que l'action avec d\u00e8pens.\nTaschereau J.-The appellants in this case claim from the respondents the amount of two policies of guarantee of the fidelity of one Whitney, their secretary-treasurer, who absconded in 1887, being a defaulter to an amount exceeding these two policies.\nThe two policies are not precisely in the same terms. However the variances between them do not affect the conclusion I have reached, that this appeal should be dismissed. The respondent s defence to the action is that the appellants failed to fulfil the undertaking's assumed by them under the policies; that they violated the essential conditions thereof; more particularly that Whitney's books were not balanced, nor his cash counted every day, as expressly covenanted; that no supervision whatever was exercised over Whitney; that no immediate notice of the defalcation was given, as agreed. The appeal court found these pleas proved and in my opinion the evidence amply supports that finding. The impression left in my mind from the consideration of the witness's depositions is that the commissioners are proved to have been grossly negligent of their duties in the matter. They say in their factum that they are public trustees existing not for the purpose of making money but for public purposes. That is so, and I am inclined to think that if their business had been to make money they would have shown more care, and exercised more supervision over their cashier. The appeal should be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Meredith & Campbell.\nSolicitors for respondents : Hall, Cross Brown & Sharp.\n[1] Q.R.2 QB.6.\n[2] 24 L.J.

The Queen v. Farwell (14 Can. S. C. R. 392.)\nThe appellant having registered his grant and taken steps to procure an indefeasible title from the registrar of titles of British Columbia, thus preventing grantees of the crown from obtaining a registered title, another information was exhibited by the Attorney Generel to direct the appellant to execute to the crown in right of Canada a surrender or conveyance of the said lands.\nHeld. 1. That the judgement in intrusion was conclusive against the appellant as to the title. The Queen v. Farwell (14 Can. S. C. R. 392) and Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada, (14 App. Cas. 295) commented on and distinguished.\n2. That the proceedings on the information of intrusion did not preclude the crown from the further remedy claimed.\n3. That the crown in right of the Dominion had a right to take proceedings to restrain an individual from making use of a provincial grant in a way to embarrass the Dominion in the exercise of its territorial rights. 4. That the rights of the crown, territorial or prerogative, are to be passed under the Great Seal of the Dominion or Province (as the case may be) in which is vested the beneficial interest therein.\n5. And that the Parliament of Canada had the right to enact that all actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity, in which the crown in right of the Dominion is plaintiff or petitioner, may be brought in the Exchequer Court. Taschereau J. dubitante.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], ordering the appellant to execute to Her Majesty the Queen, in the right of Canada, a surrender or conveyance of certain lands in British Columbia and reserving to the crown the right to apply for an order restraining the defendant from further prosecuting his proceedings before the Registrar General of Titles.\nThis was an information at the suit of Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada, to obtain an order of the court directing the defendant to execute a conveyance to Her Majesty, in right of the Dominion, of certain lands in the railway belt of British Columbia.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgment hereinafter given. See also the report of the case in the Exchequer Court (1).\nMcCarthy Q.C. for appellant contended, 1st, that the Parliament of Canada could not give concurrent original jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court in actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity.\n2. That the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction in the premises, inasmuch as the respondent is not entitled to the legal estate in the said lands by reason of the judgment of the Privy Council in the \"Precious Metals Case.\"[2]\n3. That the said court had no jurisdiction to entertain an action, the gist of which is the direct impeachment of a provincial crown grant. 4. That if the said court had jurisdiction the court erred in holding that the matter of the validity of the appellant's crown grant was res judicata, the respondent's right to possession being alone determined.\n5. That if the question of the validity of the said crown grant is res judicata by reason of the former judgment of this court, no further relief in respect of the same should be awarded against the appellant, said judgment being erroneous.\n6. That the appellant was protected by virtue of the provisions of the Land Registry Act which bound the Government of Canada.\n7. That if the whole matter of the appellant's title by conveyance from Prevost was res judicata, and the court had jurisdiction, then the respondent was barred from bringing this action by reason of the former recovery. And in addition to the cases and authorities cited in the Exchequer Court[3], the learned counsel referred to British North America Act, section 101, and section 92, subsections 13 and 14; Clement's Canadian Constitution[4]; Chitty on Prerogatives[5]; Freeman on judgments[6]; Sawyer v. Woodbury[7]; Barrs v. Jackson[8]; Queen v. Hutchings[9]; Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[10]; Russell v. Place[11]; Bell v. Merrifield[12]; Consolidated Acts, 1888, B. C. ch. 31, secs 18 and 35; Flint v.

(d); British North America Act, sec. 101. As to res judicata the decision of this court in the former action of Farwell v.

R. p. 279 et seq.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I have also come to the same conclusion.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have doubts on the question of jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court on this information. On the merits, I concur in the dismissal of the appeal upon the grounds set forth in the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014By the judgment of the Exchequer Court the appellant (the defendant below) was ordered to execute to the Queen, in right of Canada, a surrender or conveyance of the unsold portions of certain lands in British Columbia.\nThese lands are within what is known as the railway belt, a tract of land transferred to the Dominion by Act of British Columbia, 47 Vic. ch. 14 (1883). In October, 1885, an information of intrusion was filed against Farwell in respect of the lands in question. He then set up as a defence that his possession was under a grant to him issued by the Queen under the great seal of British Columbia in January, 1885, and that prior thereto the lands were in the hands and possession of the Queen. To this the Attorney General of Canada replied that, at the date referred to, the lands were in the hands and possession of the Queen, in right of the Dominion, and not in right of the province. It was so held by the Supreme Court of Canada,[28] and the defendant was put out of possession on 6th January, 1892.\nPrior to the filing of information of the intrusion, i.e., in March, 1885, Farwell began to take steps to secure for himself a certificate of indefeasible title under the \"Land Registry Act\" of British Columbia, and upon the lapse of the statutable period of seven years, sought to perfect his title under the land laws of the province by applying to the registrar of titles for certificate of indefeasible title. The effect of this, if granted, would be to prevent any purchaser from the crown in right of Canada from obtaining registry of his title, and to put a blot upon the title of the crown; and accordingly, upon public notice by the Registrar General of defendant's application, objections to the issue of the certificate were made on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, and subsequently it was agreed that the matter before the registrar should stand over until the final determination of the present action that had been previously begun.\nThe appellant contends that he is not concluded by the former judgment, because it related to the possession only, and that no further effect should be given to the judgment in that case, because, as he contends, the judgment of the judicial committee in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada[29] has subverted or weakened the foundations of the judgment in Queen v. Farwell[30]. As to the first point: Where the parties (themselves or privies) are the same, and the cause of action is the same, the estoppel extends to all matters which were, or might properly have been, brought into litigation. Where the parties (themselves or privies) are the same, but the cause of action is different, the estoppel is as to matters which, having been brought in issue, the finding upon them was material to the former decision. Here the rights of the province and the Dominion were before the court, not as a matter collateral or incidentally cognizable, but as material, upon the pleadings, in the determination of whether there had been an intrusion or not.\nBut, secondly, there is no inconsistency between Queen v. Farwell (2), and Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada (1). The former case held that the act of British Columbia transferred to the Dominion the rights in the lands which had been formerly enjoyed by the province. The latter held that the act transferred to the Dominion those rights only, and did not transfer the jura regalia, including 'therein the precious metals then in question. These were held to be in the crown, subject to the control and disposal of the Government of British Columbia. Certain expressions in the latter judgment, at pp. 301 and 302 are relied upon by the learned counsel for appellant to show that the right of the Dominion is not as great as the respondent contends for. Mr. Justice Burbidge has, however, explained these passages satisfactorily.\nPerhaps a reference to other passages in confirmation may not be superfluous.\nIn the St. Catherines Milling Co. v. The Queen[31], the same learned Lord who delivered the opinion of the judicial committee in the \"precious metal case,\" speaking of the effect of the Imperial Civil List Act of 1840, in relation to the crown lands in Canada, says:\u2014\nThere was no transfer to the province of any legal estate in the crown lands, which continued to be vested in the Sovereign; but all moneys realized by sales or in any other manner became the property of the province. In other words, all beneficial interest in such lands within the provincial boundaries belonging to the Queen, and either producing or capable of producing revenue, passed to the province, the title still remaining in the Crown.\nAnd then, speaking of the distribution of property under the British North America Act:\u2014\nIt must always be kept in view that, wherever public land with its incidents is described as 'the property of' or as 'belonging to' the Dominion or a province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use, or to its proceeds, has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province, as the case may be, and is subject to the control of the legislature, the land of itself being vested in the crown.\nThen in the case under consideration, the \"precious metal case,\"[32] the same principles are stated in their application to the territorial rights of the crown on the one hand, and to the prerogative rights of the crown in connection with such lands on the other. In the one case, as in the other, the title is in the Sovereign; but whilst, prior to the act of 1883, the entire beneficial interest, both as to the territorial and the prerogative rights of the crown, was in the province, and subject to the control of the government and legislature of the province, the effect of that act was to sever the beneficial interests, and to assign or appropriate the beneficial interest in the crown's territorial rights to the Dominion, retaining to the province the beneficial interest in the jura regalia or prerogative rights of the crown in connection with such lands.\nThus, at page 302, it is said:\u2014\nIn British Columbia the right to public lands, and the right to precious metals in all provincial lands, whether public or private, still rest upon titles as distinct as if the crown had never parted with its beneficial interests; and the crown assigned these beneficial interests to the Government of the province, in order that they might be appropriated to the same state purposes to which they would have been applicable if they had remained in the possession of the crown. Although the Provincial Government has now the disposal of all revenues derived from prerogative rights connected with land or minerals in British Columbia, those revenues differ in legal quality from the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown. It therefore appears to their Lordships that a conveyance by the province of 'public lands,' which is, in substance, an assignment of its right to appropriate the territorial revenues arising from such lands, does not imply any transfer of its interest in revenues arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown.\nAgain at page 305:\u2014\nThe expression 'lands' in the 11th article of Union admittedly carries with it the baser metals, i.e. 'mines' and 'minerals' in the sense of section 109 of the British North America Act. Mines and minerals, in that sense, are incidents of land. But jura regalia are not accessories of land; and their Lordships are of opinion that the rights to which the Dominion Government became entitled under the 11th article did not, to any extent, derogate from the provincial right to 'royalties' connected with mines and minerals under section 109 of the British North America Act.\nIt is thus abundantly (and perhaps unnecessarily) shown that the beneficial interest in the crown's territorial rights, as distinguished from the jura regalia, are appropriated to and held by the Dominion as fully and effectually, and by the same tenure, as the same had been previously appropriated to and held by the province. The title is in the Sovereign in right of the Dominion, in the same sense (as to territorial rights) as it was in the Sovereign in the right of British Columbia before the act of 1883. Mr. Justice Burbidge has effectually disposed of the suggestion that, upon a sale of the lands by the Dominion, the grant is to be passed under the great seal of British Columbia on application of the Dominion. The rights of the crown, territorial or prerogative, are to be passed under the great seal of the Dominion or province (as the case may be) in which is vested the beneficial interest therein, otherwise they cannot be said to be enjoyed by it, or under its control.\nIt is further contended that the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action to impeach a provincial crown grant. But the effect of this action is to restrain an individual from making use of a provincial grant in a way to embarrass the Dominion in the exercise of territorial rights which a statute of the province had previously vested in the Dominion. Having taken his provincial grant with knowledge of the Dominion's rights, and having put a blot on the title of the Dominion in the registry of titles in British Columbia, he is required to remove the blot, and so give unrestrained effect to what the province had agreed to do.\nIt is then said that the crown should have sought this remedy in the action for intrusion. This is also dealt with effectually in the judgment appealed from, and, on principle, there is nothing requiring dissimilar rights to be enforced at the same time.\nThe remaining objection is that the Parliament of Canada had no power to give to the Exchequer Court original jurisdiction \"in all actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the crown is plaintiff or petitioner.\" It is contended that the power of Parliament, in the establishment of courts, is limited by the British North America Act to the establishing of a court of appeal or other courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada. But \"the King has the undoubted privilege of suing in any court he pleases.\" Chitty on Prerogatives.[33]\nAnd where the matter in suit in another court concerns the revenue, or touches the profit of the King, he has the right to remove the suit into the Exchequer.\nSee the illustrations given of this in Cawthorne v. Campbell[34]. This privilege is said to be \"without the least mixture of prerogative process; or whether it is a proper subject for prerogative process only to act upon or not, that is not an ingredient.\"[35]\nIt follows, in my mind, that the crown, by and with the advice and consent of the Houses of Parliament, must have the right (a right which it would need clear words to take away) to enact that all actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity, in which the crown in right of the Dominion is plaintiff or petitioner, may be brought in the Exchequer Court\u2014the right to establish which with its other branches of jurisdiction is undisputed and indisputable.\nAgreeing with the judgment of Mr. Justice Burbidge I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McIntyre, Code & Orde.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor & Hogg.\n[1] 3 Ex.

The form of the jurat to such affidavit in the schedule is: \"Sworn to at in the county of , this day of A.D. Before me a commissioner,\" etc.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Gwynne J. dissenting, that where the jurat to an affidavit was \"sworn to at Middleton this 6th day of July, A.D. 1891, etc., without naming the county, the mortgage was void, notwithstanding the affidavit was headed \"in the county of Annapolis.\" Archibald v. Hubley (18 Can. S.C.R. 116) followed; Smith v. McLean (21 Can. S.C.R 355) distinguished.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of defendant.\nThe action in this case was against the sheriff of the County of Annapolis, N.S., to try the title to goods claimed by plaintiff under a chattel mortgage from the owner, Lewis Landers, and by defendant under execution issued on a judgment against Landers. The chattel mortgage to plaintiff was attacked on the ground that it did not comply with the provisions of R.S.N.S., 5th ser., ch. 92, sec. 4, which requires every such instrument to be accompanied by an affidavit, as nearly as may be, in the form prescribed by a schedule to the act, of the good faith of the mortgagor in giving it, or else the mortgage shall be void. By the said form the jurat to the required affidavit is to be as follows: \"Sworn to at in the county of this day of A.D. , before me a commissioner,\" etc. The affidavit of Landers accompanying the mortgage to the plaintiff, was headed, \"Canada, province of Nova Scotia, County of Annapolis,\" and the jurat was, \"sworn to at Middleton, this 6th day of July,\" etc., without containing the name of the county in which Middleton is situated. Defendant contended that this departure from the form vitiated the mortgage, while plaintiff urged that section 11 of said chapter 92, providing that slight deviations from prescribed forms, not affecting the substance nor calculated to mislead, shall not vitiate them, operated to cure this defect, and that as the affidavit showed on its face that it was sworn in Annapolis County, in which Middleton is situate, the case is within the decision in Smith v. McLean[1].\nThe trial judge held the chattel mortgage void on the authority of Archibald v. Hubley[2]. His judgment was reversed by the full court from whose decision the defendant appealed.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellant, referred to Archibald v. Hubley (2); Parsons v. Brand[3]; Thomas v. Kelly[4]; Ford v. Kettle[5]; Furber v. Cobb[6]; Blankenstein v. Robertson[7].\nHarrington Q.C. for the respondent, cited Cheney v. Courtois[8]; Bird v. Davie[9]; Ex parte Johnson[10]; Emerson v. Banner man[11]. FOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is an action against the sheriff of Annapolis County, for the return of goods taken by him under a writ of execution against one Lewis Landers. The goods were in possession of Landers when taken by the sheriff, but are claimed by the plaintiff under a chattel mortgage from Landers to him. The defendant justified under the execution, and also pleaded that the chattel mortgage under which the plaintiff claims is invalid under chapter 92 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia.\nThe action was tried before Chief Justice McDonald, without a jury. The learned Chief Justice gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court in banco. The appeal was heard by Weatherbe, Ritchie, Graham and Meagher JJ. A majority of the learned judges consisting of Weatherbe, Graham and Meagher JJ., were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, Meagher J. dubitante. Ritchie J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. A rule was granted allowing the appeal. The defendant now appeals.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia allowed the appeal on the ground that the chattel mortgage under which the plaintiff claims is a valid instrument as against the defendant under chapter 92, Revised Statutes, Nova Scotia, fifth series.\nUpon the true construction of chapter 92, R.S. N.S., fifth series, the chattel mortgage under which the plaintiff claims is, in my opinion, invalid as against the defendant for non-compliance with the statute. Section 2, of chapter 92, is imperative that the affidavit accompanying the chattel mortgage shall be as nearly as may be in the form prescribed by the statute. Archibald v. Hubley[12]; Emerson v. Bannerman[13]; Parsons v. Brand[14]; Thomas v. Kelly[15]; Furber v. Cobb[16]; Re Andrews[17].\nThe form of affidavit prescribed by the statute requires the commissioner or person before whom the affidavit is sworn to certify that it was sworn \"in the county of \" leaving a blank for the county. The person before whom this affidavit was sworn has omitted this statement from his certificate. The jurat to this affidavit does not state, either expressly or by reference, the county in which the oath was administered, and the person administering the oath does not state for what county he is a justice of the peace.\nThis omission, it seems to me, brings the present case directly within the authority of Archibald v. Hubley (1) as held by Chief Justice Macdonald at the trial.\nIn that case the person swearing the affidavit omitted to certify that the affidavit was sworn before him, and in this case the person swearing the affidavit omitted to certify that it was sworn in the county where the oath was administered. If the form requires the one fact to be certified it also requires the other.\nThe decision in that case of Archibald v. Hubley (1) is not modified, and never was intended to be, by the decision in Smith v. McLean[18].\nI would allow this appeal and restore the judgment which dismissed the action.\nGWYNNE J. The judgment of this court in Archibald v. Hubley (8), does not hold or purport to hold that section 11 of ch. 1 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia 5th series has no application to a case like the present. That section enacts that where forms are prescribed in statutes slight deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead shall not vitiate them. By the 4th and 5th sections of ch. 92 of the same series it was enacted that chattel mortgages and bills of sale therein respectively mentioned should be accompanied by an affidavit of the grantor of its bona fides to the effect in these sections respectively mentioned, and by section 11 it was enacted that the affidavits mentioned in the said 4th and 5th sections should be as nearly as may be in the form given in schedules A and B respectively. At the foot of the forms in these schedules is given the form of the jurat as follows:\u2014\n\"Sworn to at in the county of this day of A.D. 18\n\"Before me\"\nNow what the court decided in Archibald v. Hubley[19] was that the omission of the words \"before me\" in the jurat to the affidavit of the grantor of the bill of sale in that case wholly vitiated the affidavit; made it in fact no affidavit, although the commissioner who took it testified in court upon oath in an issue as to the title to the property purported to be conveyed by the bill of sale which accompanied the affidavit, that the affidavit was sworn to before him.\nThe result of that case then simply is that the omission of the words \"before me\" in the jurat of such an affidavit was not such a slight deviation from the prescribed form not affecting the substance as would come within the protection and saving influence of ch. 1, section 11. That is all that case can be said to have decided. The court did not attempt to lay down and indeed could not lay down any fixed rule applicable to the determination in all cases of the question what deviation would and what would not be within the protection of the section 11 of ch. 1. Then in Smith v. McLean[20], a question arose upon the same statute ch. 92.\nThe form prescribed for an affidavit to be made by the grantor of the bill of sale commenced as follows:\u2014 \"I A. B. of in the county of (occupation) make oath and say as follows, &c.\" In the affidavit under consideration the \"occupation\" of the person making the affidavit was omitted wholly, but the court held that that omission did not vitiate the affidavit as his occupation appeared on the face of the bill of sale to which the affidavit referred. That omission was plainly one which constituted such a slight deviation from the prescribed form as brought it within the protection of ch. 1 section 11.\nThe question in the present case is simply this: Does the deviation from the prescribed form in the present case constitute only such a slight deviation not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead, as to bring it within the protection of the statute\u2014and so not vitiate the instrument; or is it, on the contrary, so substantial a variance or so calculated to mislead as not to come within the protection of the statute and to be fatal to the validity of the instrument? The variance is this. The affidavit is headed as made in \"Canada\u2014Province of Nova Scotia,\n\"County of Annapolis.\"\nThe jurat was\u2014\"Sworn to at Middleton this 6th \"day of July, A.D. 1891\n\"Before me\nA. W. PHINNEY, J.P.\nleaving out the name of the county in which Middleton is. But that the affidavit was sworn in the county of Annapolis appears from the heading to the affidavit, and that Middleton is situated in the county of Annapolis is not disputed. Now without impugning in the slightest degree the judgment of this court in Archibald v. Hubley[21] I must say that this omission does appear to me to constitute just such a slight deviation from the prescribed form, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead, as to come within the protection of ch. 1 section 11, and that we must therefore hold that the omission does not vitiate. It certainly appears to me to be as harmless a deviation from the prescribed form as was that in Smith v. McLean[22].\nAll cases of this description must be brought to the test of the statute ch. 1 section 11.\nI am of opinion therefore that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is as to the validity of a chattel mortgage given by one Landers to the respondent, the plaintiff below. Upon the trial the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia held that the instrument was invalid for want of compliance with the statute, ch. 92, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, per Weatherbe, Graham and Meagher JJ., (Ritchie J. dissenting) reversed the judgment and this appeal is from that decision.\nThe statute referred to requires that\nEvery bill of sale of personal chattels made either absolutely or conditionally, subject or not subject to any trust, shall be filed with the registrar.\nIt also provides (sec. 4) that:\nEvery bill of sale or chattel mortgage of personal property other than mortgages to secure future advances shall hereafter be accompanied by an affidavit of the party giving the same or his agent or attorney duly authorised in that behalf, that the amount set forth therein as being the consideration thereof is justly and honestly due and owing by the grantor * * *; otherwise such bill of sale or chattel mortgage shall be null and void as against the creditors of the grantor or mortgagor.\nBy sec. 11 it is provided that the affidavits mentioned in secs. 4 and 5 shall be as nearly as may be in the form in schedules A and B, respectively, and the following is the form of jurat in said schedules:\u2014\n\"Sworn to at , in the county of , this day of , A. D., 18 , before me.\n(Signed), A. B.\"\nIn the jurat to the affidavit accompanying and filed with this chattel mortgage there was no reference to the county. The jurat was as follows: \"Sworn to at Middleton, this 6th day of July, A.D., 1891, before me, (Signed), A. W. P., J. P.\"\nIn Archibald v. Hubley,[23] (a case under the same statute), it was held that the omission of the day of the month and the words \"before me\" from the jurat rendered the bill of sale void. This was a decision of the late Chief Justice, and of Justices Fournier and Patterson, Justices Taschereau and Gwynne dissenting. At page 112 the late Chief Justice says:\u2014\nIf these can be omitted why may not the place where sworn be likewise dispensed with and so the whole jurat be got rid of?\nPatterson J., (p. 135) says:\u2014\nBy sec. 4 the mortgage or bill of sale is to be null and void as against creditors unless the prescribed affidavit of bona fides is made, and sec. 11 is imperative that it shall be as nearly as may be in the given form. This is undistinguisable from the English Act of 1882 which provides in sec. 9 that the bill of sale shall be void if not made in accordance with the form in the schedule to the act * * * Some of the decisions in Ontario which have been cited have gone as far as liberal construction of the facts would allow to uphold defective affidavits in cases of this kind, but no case has gone the length we are asked to go in this case and besides they have no provision in Ontario like that of the 11th sec. of the Nova Scotia Act.\"\nIf it were not for this decision, it might perhaps be open to point out a possible distinction between the English and the Nova Scotia act, in this, that, by the former, the formal characteristics, are expressly made matters of substance by the direct provision avoiding the bill of sale if not made in accordance with the form, while in the case of the act in question the penalty is laid for non-compliance with a provision requiring an affidavit setting forth certain matters of substance; and then by a further provision (sec. 11) it is enacted that such affidavit shall be as nearly as may be in the forms in the schedules, which forms deal with both formal and substantial requirements.\nBut as already observed the decision in Archibald v. Hubley[24] makes no account of this verbal difference and treats the enactment in question as though it in terms enacted that the bill of sale, &c. should be void if not made as nearly as may be in the form given in the schedule. In this state of things the form given in the schedule cannot be treated merely as a model (as is ordinarily the case when forms are prescribed) for the form becomes a matter of substance; the essence of the thing is in the form, and the provision is unaffected by the general statutory provision that \"forms when prescribed shall admit variations not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead.\" It has not been held under the English Statute that slavish or literal adherence to the form is required, but it has been held that in a case where form is prescribed and departure from it penalized, divergence from the form in what is characteristic of it is fatal.\nIn Ex parte Stamford,[25] Bowen C. J., delivering the judgment of five judges of the Court of Appeal, says:\u2014\nBut a divergence only becomes substantial or material when it is calculated to give the bill of sale a legal consequence or effect either greater or smaller than that which would attach to it if drawn in the form which has been sanctioned. And he adds:\u2014\nWe must consider whether the instrument as drawn will in virtue either of addition or omission, have any legal effect which either goes beyond or falls short of that which would result from the statutory form.\nIn Thomas v. Kelly,[26] Lord Fitzgerald says:\u2014\nI would hesitate, my lords, to criticise a proposition coming from a tribunal so important and so weightily constituted (Lord Esher M. R., and Cotton, Lindley, Bowen and Lopes JJ., Fry L. J. diss). I am not now called on to do so, nor shall I say more than that I am not now to be taken as adopting in all its terms that rule of construction, as affording an inclusive as well as exclusive test.\nLord Macnaghten (p. 519) says that:\u2014\nThe section seems to me to deal with form and form only. So purely is it, I venture to think, a question of form, that I should be inclined to doubt whether a bill of sale would not be void which omitted the proviso referring to section 7, though I cannot see that the omission would alter the legal effect of the document in the slightest degree, or mislead anybody. It has been held, and I think rightly, that section 9 does not require a bill of sale to be a verbal and literal transcript of the statutory form. The words of the act are \"in accordance with the form,\" not \"in the form.\" But then comes the question: When is an instrument which purports to be a bill of sale not in accordance with the statutory form? Possibly when it departs from the statutory form in anything which is not merely a matter of verbal difference. Certainly I should say, when it departs from the statutory from in anything which is a characteristic of that form.\nIn his dissenting judgment in Ex parte Stamford[27], Fry J. says:\u2014\nThe act of 1882 is a remarkable statute, imposing stringent fetters on the power of contracting in respect of loans on chattels * * * It is a statute which deals in an imperious manner, not with the substance only, but with the form of the instrument * * Again, the particular section now in question (the 9th) is an enactment of a remarkable, and so far as I know of late years, novel description, for it is aimed, not at the operation or substance of an instrument, but at its form, and in its demand for accordance with the scheduled form, it has no words of indulgence, such as, \"or to the like purport or effect,' and in default of such accordance it makes the instrument void not as against third persons only, but as against the maker himself. Parsons v. Brand[28], was a case where a bill of sale was held void because both the address and description of the attesting witness did not appear in the attestation clause in accordance with the direction to that effect contained in the form. The omission was not held to be one which altered the legal effect of the instrument, but Thomas v. Kelly[29], was considered as clearly holding that divergence from the form was not necessarily immaterial because it did not alter the effect of the instrument. Lord Justice Cotton also says that the word \"form\" does not refer only to what expresses the contract between the parties. He also pointed out that the test laid down in Ex parte Stamford[30], was one applicable only where the alleged divergence relates to the effect of the contract, and says that that case \"must not be taken as intended to lay down a rule that nothing is a material departure from the form unless it alters the effect of the instrument.\"\nLindley L.J. (a party also to Ex parte Stamford (3), says:\u2014\nIt is a hard thing to be obliged to upset a fair transaction because t's are not crossed and i's not dotted, but we must give effect to the act, and I cannot see that a document is in accordance with the form unless all particulars are filled up which the form requires to be filled up.\nIn Bird v. Davey [31] the bill of sale had two attestation clauses attesting the execution of the instrument by two different grantors respectively. The signature to both attestation clauses was the same, and in one of them the address and description of the attesting witness was given, but in the other they were not. It was held that the form was complied with because, from what appeared on the face of the bill itself, an irresistible inference, in the opinion of the court, arose that the witness in the two attestation clauses was the same person. Pollock B. and Day J. had decided adversely to the bill of sale on the authority of Parsons v. Brand[32], but the Court of Appeal (Lord Esher, Lindley and Lopes L. JJ.) reversed the decision. The effect of the act is that the name, address and description of the attesting witness must appear on the face of the bill of sale. Lord Esher says[33]:\nIf any extraneous evidence were necessary to show that the two signatures were those of the same man I should say that such evidence could not be given, and that the requirements of the act had not been satisfied. But if on looking at what appears on the face of the bill of sale, the inference is irresistible, so that the court can have no doubt that it was the same man who signed both attestation clauses, then the result is that the address and description of the attesting witness to the second attestation clause are given on the face of the bill of sale. To say that the address and description must be given in any particular order, as suggested by the counsel for the execution creditor, would, I think, be construing the act too strictly. In this case each member of the court, on looking at the bill of sale, has not the smallest doubt that the evidence is irresistible that the two attestation clauses are signed by the same person. Under these circumstances the case is distinguishable from Parsons v. Brand (1).\nLindley L.J. says:\u2014\nThe form in the schedule says: \"Add witness's name, address and description.\" Therefore the name, address and description must appear on the face of the instrument, and in the attestation clause somewhere; but the act does not say that where the same witness is attesting several signatures, he must set out his address and description as often as he attests. I cannot bring myself to think that the act requires such strictness as that. If it plainly appears on the face of the instrument that it is the same witness that is attesting in each case, and his address and description be given once, it appears to me to be sufficient.\nLopes J. says:\u2014\nIf from what appears on the face of the bill of sale, without any external evidence an irresistible interference arises, there is nothing to prevent us from drawing that inference.\nThis latter case appears to introduce a new element, the right of the court in such cases to draw inferences of fact from the physical appearance of the instrument, inferences of fact based on their knowledge of handwriting, as distinguished from conclusions as to the construction of the written matter. Still it lays down that there must be an irresistible inference to the same effect as the form requires.\nThen there is the case of Smith v. McLean[34], a case under the statute now in question. The form requires that in the affidavit the occupation of the deponent shall be stated. The affidavit referred to the deponent as \"the within named grantor,\" and in the body of the bill of sale the occupation of the grantor was given. It was held, following Bird v. Davey [35] that it was sufficient if the required fact appeared upon the face of the instrument, and that it did so appear by virtue of the words of reference contained in the affidavit and the fact referred to in the body of the bill of sale. It was, as the learned counsel for the appellant contends, a case of the deponent making a reference, and not of the court making an inference.\nPatterson J says[36]:\u2014\nBut whatever the deed shows respecting the grantor the affidavit also shows respecting the deponent, who swears that he is the same person as the grantor; by this reference to the deed the occupation is shown and the statute satisfied.\nIt was said that there should be a presumption of regularity, but in Ford v. Kettle[37], Jessel M.R. says that where there is no act of Parliament things may be presumed to have been done which are not to be presumed where an act requires it to be stated.\nIt appears to me that, in principle, Archibald v. Hubley [38] is not to be distinguished from the case before us. It is a substantial thing that the affidavit should be sworn before the justice or commissioner. Archibald v. Hubley (5) holds that it is a substantial part of the form that this matter of substance should be stated. It is no less a substantial thing that the affidavit should be taken in the county where the justice or commissioner has jurisdiction to administer it. It must be equally, as in the other case, a substantial matter of form that this matter of substance should be stated.\nIf the jurat had any words of reference by which the place of swearing could be made to appear anywhere on the face of the instrument e.g. if it ran thus: \"Sworn to at Middleton aforesaid,\" then as the deed made reference to but one Middleton and to it as being in the county of Annapolis, the case would be within Smith v. McLean[39]. Id certum est quod certum reddi potest. The naming of the county at the head of the affidavit does not advance the matter at all. What is required is that the place of swearing shall be rendered reasonably certain as to the county by the jurat, and be so certified to in terms by the official administering the oath, as is done by a jurat following the form. It is a not unimportant matter as tending to the authentication of the swearing that the jurat should state the place where sworn.\nGrant v. Fry[40], cited by the learned judge, is not to the contrary of this. The jurat there stated the affidavit to have been sworn in Cheltenham aforesaid, and the deponent was in the body of the affidavit described as of Cheltenham in the county of Gloucester.\nThe affidavit failing to satisfy the requirement of the act in substantial matters of form, the bill of sale is avoided. The result is that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cummings & Lovitt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. G. H. Parker.\n[1] 21 Can.

McGEE,\nClerk of the Privy Councit.\nCASE.\nAnnexed hereto is an order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, made on the 29th December, 1892, approving of a report of a sub-Committee of Council thereto annexed upon certain memorials complaining of two statutes of the Legislature of Manitoba, relating to education, passed in the session of 1890. The memorials therein referred to, and all correspondence in connection therewith, are hereby made part of this case, together with all statutes, whether Provincial, Dominion, or Imperial, in any wise dealing with, or affecting the subject of education in Manitoba, and all proceedings had or taken before the Court of Queen's Bench, Manitoba, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the causes of Barrett v. the City of Winnipeg, and Logan v. the City of Winnipeg; and all decisions or judgments in such cases are to be considered as part of this case and are to be referred to accordingly. The questions for hearing and consideration by the Supreme Court of Canada being the same as those indicated in the report of the Sub-Committee of Council above referred to, are as follows:\u2014\n(1.) Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions, and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by sub-section 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, or by sub-section 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 33 Victoria (1870), chapter 3, Canada?\n(2.) Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the sub-sections above referred to, or either of them?\n(3.) Does the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the cases of Barrett v. the City of Winnipeg, and Logan v. the City of Winnipeg, dispose of or conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union under the statutes of the province have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained of in the said petitions and memorials?\n(4.) Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, apply to Manitoba?\n(5.) Has His Excellency the Governor General in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions, assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises?\n(6.) Did the Acts of Manitoba relating to education, passed prior to the session of 1890, confer on or continue to the minority a \"right or privilege in relation to education\" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, or establish a \"system of separate and dissentient schools within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 93 of 'the British North America Act, 1867,'\" if said section 93 be found to be applicable to Manitoba; and if so, did the two Acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council?\nReport of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 29th of December, 1892.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had under consideration a report, hereto annexed, from a sub-committee of Council, to whom where referred certain memorials to Your Excellency, complaining of two statutes of the Legislature of Manitoba, relating to education, passed in the session of 1890.\nThe Committee, concurring in the report of the subcommittee, submit the same for Your Excellency's approval, and recommend that Saturday, the 21 st day of January, 1893, at the chamber of the Privy Council, at Ottawa, be fixed as the day on which the parties concerned shall be heard with regard to the appeal in the matter of the said statutes.\nThe Committee further advise that a copy of this minute, if approved, together with a copy of the report of the sub-committee of Council, be transmitted to the Lieutenant-governor of Manitoba.\nJOHN J. McGEE,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\u2014\nThe sub-committee to whom were referred certain memorials, addressed to Your Excellency in Council, complaining of two statutes of the Legislature of Manitoba, relating to education, passed in the session of 1890, have the honor to make the following report:\nThe first of these memorials is from the officers and executive committee of the \"National Congress,\" an organization which seems to have been established in June, 1890, in Manitoba.\nThis memorial sets forth that two Acts of the Legislature of Manitoba, passed in 1890, intituled respectively, \"An Act respecting the Department of Education\" and \"An Act respecting Public Schools,\" deprive the Roman Catholic minority in Manitoba of rights and privileges which they enjoyed with regard to education previous to the establishment of the province, and since that time down to the passing of the Acts aforesaid, of 1890.\nThe memorial calls attention to the fact that soon after the passage of those Acts, (and in the year 1891) a petition was presented to Your Excellency, signed by a large number of the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Manitoba, praying that Your Excellency might entertain an appeal on behalf of the Roman Catholic minority against the said Acts, and that it might be declared \"that such Acts had a prejudicial effect on the rights and privileges, with regard to denominational schools, which the Roman Catholics had, by law or practice, in the province, at the union;\" also that directions might be given and provision made in the premises for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the Province of Manitoba.\nThe memorial of the \"National Congress\" recites, at length, the allegations of the petition last hereinbefore referred to, as having been laid before Your Excellency in 1891. The substance of those allegations seems to be the following: That, before the passage of the Act constituting the Province of Manitoba, known as the \"Manitoba Act,\" there existed, in the territory now constituting the province, a number of effective schools for children, which schools were denominational, some of them being erected and controlled by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, and others by the authorities of various Protestant denominations; that those schools were supported, to some extent by fees, and also by assistance from the funds contributed by the members of the church or denomination under whose care the school was established; that at that period the Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of Protestant denominations, nor had Protestants any interest in or control over the schools of Roman Catholics; that there were no public schools in the province, in the sense of State schools; that members of the Roman Catholic Church supported schools for their own children and for the benefit of Roman Catholic children, and were not under obligations to contribute to the support of any other schools.\nThe petition then asserted that, in consequence of this state of affairs, the Roman Catholics were separate from the rest of the community, in the matter of education, at the time of the passage of the Manitoba Act.\nReference is then made to the provisions of the Manitoba Act by which the legislature was restricted from making any law on the subject of education which should have a prejudicial effect on the rights and privileges, with respect to denominational schools, \"which any class of persons had, by law or practice, in the province at the \"'union.'\"\nThe petition then set forth that, during the first session of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, an Act was passed relating to education, the effect of which was to continue to the Roman Catholics the separate condition, with reference to education, which they had enjoyed previous to the union; and that ever since that time, until the session of 1890, no attempt was made to encroach upon the rights of the Roman Catholics in that regard; but that the two statutes referred to, passed in the session of 1890, had the effect of depriving the Roman Catholics altogether of their separate condition with regard to education, and merged their schools with those of the Protestant denominations, as they required all members of the community, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to contribute to the support of what were therein called \"Public Schools,\" but what would be, the petitioners alleged, in reality a continuation of the Protestant schools.\nAfter setting forth the objections which Roman Catholics entertain to such a system of education as was established by the Acts of 1890, the petitioners declared that they appealed from the acts complained of and they presented the prayer for redress which is hereinbefore recited.\nThe petition of the \"Congress\" then sets forth the minute of Council, approved by Your Excellency on the 4th April, 1891, adopting a report of the Minister of Justice, which set out the scope and effect of the legislation complained of, and also the provisions of the Manitoba Act with reference to education. That report stated that a question had arisen as to the validity and effect of the two statutes of 1890, referred to as the subject of the appeal, and intimated that those statutes would probably be held to be ultra vires of the legislature of Manitoba if they were found to have prejudicially affected \"any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had, by law or practice, in the province at the union.\" The report suggested that questions of fact seemed to be raised by the petitions, which were then under consideration, as to the practice in Manitoba with regard to schools, at the time of the union, and also questions of law as to whether the state of facts then existing constituted a \"right or privilege\" of the Roman Catholics, within the meaning of the saving clauses in the Manitoba Act, and as to whether the acts complained of (of 1890) had \"prejudicially affected\" such \"right or privilege.\" The report set forth that these were obviously questions to be decided by a legal tribunal, before the appeal asserted by the petitioners could be taken up and dealt with, and that if the allegations of the petitioners and their contentions as to the law, were well founded, there would be no occasion for Your Excellency to entertain or to act upon the appeal, as the courts would decide the act to be ultra vires. The report and the minute adopting it, were clearly based on the view that consideration of the complaints and appeal of the Roman Catholic minority, as set forth in the petitions, should be deferred until the legal controversy should be determined, as it would then be ascertained whether the appellants should find it necessary to press for consideration of their application for redress under the saving clauses of the British North America Act and the Manitoba Act, which seemed, by their view of the law, to provide for protection of the rights of a minority against legislation (within the competence of the legislature), which might interfere with rights which had been conferred on the minority, after the union.\nThe memorial of the \"Congress\" goes on to state that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in England, has upheld the validity of the acts complained of, and the \"memorial \"asserts that the time has now come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act. There was also referred to the sub-committee a memorial from the Archbishop of Saint Boniface, complaining of the two Acts of 1890, before mentioned, and calling attention to former petitions on the same subject from members of the Roman Catholic minority in the province. His Grace made reference, in this memorial, to assurances which were given by one of Your Excellency's predecessors before the passage of the Manitoba Act, to redress all well founded grievances and to respect the civil and religious rights and privileges of the people of the Red River territory. His Grace then prayed that Your Excellency should entertain the appeal of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba and might consider the same, and might make such directions for the hearing and consideration of the appeal as might be thought proper, and also give directions for the relief of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba.\nThe sub-committee also had before them a memorandum made by the \"Conservative League\" of Montreal remonstrating against the (alleged) unfairness of the Acts of 1890, before referred to.\nSoon after the reference was made to the sub-committee of the memorial of the \"National Congress\" and of the other memorials just referred to, intimation was conveyed to the sub-committee, by Mr. John S. Ewart, counsel for the Roman Catholic minority in Manitoba, that, in his opinion, it was desirable that a further memorial, on behalf of that minority, should be presented before the pending application should be dealt with, and action on the part of the sub-committee was therefore delayed until the further petition should come in.\nLate in November this supplementary memorial was received and referred to the sub-committee. It is signed by the Archbishop of St. Boniface, and by the President of the \"National Congress,\" the Mayor of St. Boniface, and about 137 others, and is presented in the name of the \"members of the Roman Catholic Church resident in the province of Manitoba.\"\nIts allegations are very similar to those hereinbefore recited, as being contained in the memorial of the congress, but there is a further contention that the two acts of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, passed in 1890, on the subject of education, were \"subversive of the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority provided for by the statutes of Manitoba, prior to the passing of the said acts of 1890, thereby violating both the British North America Act and the Manitoba Act.\"\nThis last mentioned memorial urged:\u2014\n(1.) That Your Excellency might entertain the appeal and give directions for its proper consideration.\n(2.) That Your Excellency should declare that the two acts of 1890 (chapters 37 and 38), do prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of the minority, with regard to denominational schools, which they had by law or practice, in the province, at the union.\n(3.) That it may be declared that the said acts affect the rights and privileges of Roman Catholics in relation to education.\n(4.) That the re-enactment may be ordered by Your Excellency of the statutes in force in Manitoba, prior to these acts of 1890, in so far, at least, as may be necessary to secure for Roman Catholics in the province the right to build, maintain, &c., their schools in the manner provided by such statutes, and to secure to them their proportionate share of any grant made out of public funds of the province for education, or to relieve such members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholic schools from payment or contribution to the support of any other schools; or that these acts of 1890 should be so amended as to effect that purpose.\nThen follows a general prayer for relief.\nIn making their report the sub-committee will comment only upon the last memorial presented, as it seems to contain, in effect, all the allegations embraced in the former petitions which call for their consideration and is more specific as to the relief which is sought.\nAs to the request which the petitioners make in the second paragraph of their prayer, viz.: \"That it may be declared that the said Acts (53 Vic., chs. 37 and 38) do prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which the Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province of Manitoba at the time of the union,\" the sub-committee are of opinion that the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is conclusive as to the rights with regard to denominational schools which the Roman Catholics had at the time of the union, and as to the bearing thereon of the statutes complained of, and Your Excellency is not, therefore, in the opinion of the sub-committee, properly called upon to hear an appeal based on those grounds. That judgment is as binding on Your Excellency as it is on any of the parties to the litigation, and, therefore, if redress is sought on account of the state of affairs existing in the province at the time of the union, it must be sought elsewhere and by other means than by way of appeal under the sections of the British North America Act and of the Manitoba Act, which are relied on by the petitioners as sustaining this appeal.\nThe two Acts of 1890, which are complained of, must, according to the opinion of the sub-committee, be regarded as within the powers of the Legislature of Manitoba, but it remains to be considered whether the appeal should be entertained and heard as an appeal. against statutes which are alleged to have encroached on rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which were acquired by any class of persons in Manitoba, not at the time of the union, but after the union.\nThe sub-committee were addressed by counsel for the petitioners as to the right to have the appeal heard, and from his argument, as well as from the documents, it would seem that the following are the grounds of the appeal:\u2014\nA complete system of separate and denominational schools, i.e., a system providing for Public Schools and for Separate Catholic Schools, was, it is alleged, established by Statute of Manitoba in 1871, and by a series of subsequent Acts. That system was in operation until the two Acts of 1890 (chapters 37 and 38) were passed.\nThe 93rd section of the British North America Act, in conferring power on the provincial legislatures exclusively to make laws in relation to education, imposed on that power certain restrictions, one of which was (sub-section 1) to preserve the right with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law in the province at the union. As to this restriction it seems to impose a condition on the validity of any Act relating to education, and the subcommittee have already observed that no question, it seems to them, can arise, since the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nThe third sub-section, however, is as follows:\u2014\n\"Where in any province a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law at the union, or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or decision of any provincial authority, affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\"\nThe Manitoba Act passed in 1870, by which the province of Manitoba was constituted, contains the following provisions, as regards that province:\u2014\nBy section 22 the power is conferred on the legislature exclusively to make laws in relation to education, but subject to the following restrictions:\n(1) \"Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have, by law or practice, in the province at the union.\"\nThis restriction, the sub-committee again observe, has been dealt with by the judgment of the judicial committee of the Privy Council.\nThen follows:\n(2) \"An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or decision of the legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority, affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\"\nIt will be observed that the restriction contained in subsection 2 is not identical with the restriction of subsection 3 of the 93rd section of the British North America Act, and questions are suggested, in view of this difference, as to whether subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act applies to Manitoba, and, if not, whether subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act is sufficient to sustain the case of the appellants; or, in other words, whether, in regard to Manitoba, the minority has the same protection against laws which the legislature of the province has power to pass, as the minorities in other provinces have, under the subsection before quoted from the British North America Act, as to separate or denominational schools established after the union.\nThe argument presented by counsel on behalf of the petitioners was, that the present appeal comes before Your Excellency in Council, not as a request to review the decision of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, but as a logical consequence and result of that decision, inasmuch as the remedy now sought is provided by the British North America Act, and the Manitoba Act, not as a remedy to the minority against statutes which interfere with the rights which the minority had at the time of the union, but as a remedy against statutes which interfere with rights acquired by the minority after the union. The remedy, therefore, which is sought, is against acts which are intra vires of the provincial legislature. His argument is also that the appeal does not ask Your Excellency to interfere with any rights or powers of the legislature of Manitoba, inasmuch as the power to legislate on the subject of education has only been conferred on that legislature with the distinct reservation that Your Excellency in Council shall have power to make remedial orders against any such legislation which infringes on rights acquired after the union by any Protestant or Roman Catholic minority in relation to separate or dissentient schools.\nUpon the various questions which arise on these petitions the sub-committee do not feel called upon to express an opinion, and, so far as they are aware, no opinion has been expressed on any previous occasion in this case or any other of a like kind, by Your Excellency's Government or any other Government of Canada. Indeed, no application of a parallel character has been made since the establishment of the Dominion.\nThe application comes before Your Excellency in a manner differing from applications which are ordinarily made, under the constitution, to Your Excellency in Council. In the opinion of the sub-committee the application is not to be dealt with at present as a matter of a political character or involving political action on the part of Your Excellency's advisers. It is to be dealt with by Your Excellency in Council, regardless of the personal views which Your Excellency's advisers may hold with regard to denominational schools and without the political action of any of the members of Your Excellency's Council being considered as pledged by the fact of the appeal being entertained and heard. If the contention of the petitioners be correct, that such an appeal can be sustained, the inquiry will be rather of a judicial than a political character. The sub-committee have so treated it in hearing counsel, and in permitting their only meeting to be open to the public. It is apparent that several other questions will arise, in addition to those which were discussed by counsel at that meeting, and the sub-committee advises that a date be fixed at which the petitioners, or their counsel, may be heard with regard to the appeal, according to their first request.\nThe sub-committee think it proper that the Government of Manitoba should have an opportunity to be represented at the hearing, and they further recommend, with that view, that if this report should be approved, a copy of any minute approving it, and of any minute fixing the date of the hearing with regard to the appeal, be forwarded, together with copies of all the petitions referred to, to His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, for the information of His Honour's advisers.\nIn the opinion of the sub-committee the attention of any person who may attend on behalf of the petitioners, or on behalf of the Provincial Government, should be called to certain preliminary questions which seem to arise with regard to the appeal. Among the questions which the sub-committee regard as preliminary are the following:\u2014\n(1.) Whether this appeal is such an appeal as is contemplated by sub-section 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, or by sub-section 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act:\n(2.) Whether the grounds set forth in the petitions are such as may be the subject of appeal under either of the sub-sections above referred to.\n(3.) Whether the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in any way bears on the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890 before referred to.\n(4.) Whether subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act applies to Manitoba.\n(5.) Whether Your Excellency in Council has power to grant such orders as are asked for by the petitioner, assuming the material facts to be as stated in the petition.\n(6.) Whether the Acts of Manitoba, passed before the session of 1890, conferred on the minority a \"right or privilege with respect to education,\" within the meaning of sub-section 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, or established \"a system of separate or dissentient schools,\" within the meaning of sub-section 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, and if so, whether the two Acts of 1890, complained of, affect, \"the right or privilege\" of the minority in such a manner as to warrant the present appeal.\nOther questions of alike character may be suggested at the hearing, and it may be desirable that arguments should be heard upon such preliminary points before any hearing shall take place on the merits of the appeal.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJno.

Mayne Daly.\nSt. Boniface, 22nd September, 1892.\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to transmit to you herewith inclosed a petition for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General in Council concerning the appeal of the Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba with regard to education.\nI have, etc.,\n\u2020 ALEX. TACH\u00c9,\nArch. of St. Boniface, O.M.I.\nTo the Honourable\nThe Secretary of State for Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\nThe humble petition of the undersigned, Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church in the province of Manitoba, respectfully sheweth:\u2014\n1st. That two statutes, 53 Vic., chap. 37 and 38, were passed in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba to merge the Roman Catholic Schools with those of the Protestant denominations, and to require all members of the community, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to contribute, through taxation, to the support of what are therein called Public Schools, but which are in reality a continuation of the Protestant Schools.\n2nd. That on the 4th of April, 1890, James E. P. Prendergast, M.P.P. for Woodlands, transmitted to the honourable the Secretary of State for Canada a petition, signed by eight members of the legislative assembly of Manitoba, to make known to His Excellency the Governor General the grievances under which Her Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects of the province of Manitoba were suffering by the passage of the said two acts, respectively intituled: \"An Act respecting the Department of Education,\" and \"An Act respecting Public Schools,\" (53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38). The said petition ended by the following words:\u2014\"Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that Your Excellency may be pleased to take such action and grant such relief and remedy as to Your Excellency may seem meet and just.\"\n3rd. That on the 7th of April, the same year, 1890, the Catholic section of the Board of Education, in a petition signed by its president, the Archbishop of St, Boniface, and its secretary, T. A. Bernier, \"most respectfully and earnestly prayed His Excellency the Governor General in Council that said last mentioned acts (53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38) be disallowed to all intents and purposes.\"\n4th. That on the 12th of April, 1890, the undersigned brought before His Excellency some of the facts concerning the outbreak which occurred at Red River during the winter of 1869-70; the part that the undersigned was invited, by Imperial and Federal authorities, to take in the pacification of the country; the promise intrusted to the undersigned in an autograph letter from the then Governor General that the people of Red River \"may rely that respect and attention will be extended to the different religious persuasions;\" the furnishing the undersigned with a proclamation to be made known to the dissatisfied population, in which proclamation the then Governor General declared:\u2014\"Her Majesty commands me to state to you that she will be always ready, through me as her representative, to redress all well-founded grievances.\" By Her Majesty's authority, I do therefore assure you that on your union with Canada \"all your civil and religious rights and privileges will be respected.\" In the strength of such assurance the people of Red River consented to their union with Canada, and the Act of Manitoba was passed, giving guarantees to the minority that their rights and privileges, acquired by law or practice, with regard to education, would be protected. The cited Acts, 53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38, being a violation of the assurances given to the Red River population, through the Manitoba Act, the undersigned ended his petition of the 12th April, 1890, by the following words:\u2014\n\"I therefore most respectfully and most earnestly pray that Your Excellency, as the representative of our most beloved Queen, should take such steps that in your wisdom would seem the best remedy against the evils that the above mentioned and recently enacted laws are preparing in this part of Her Majesty's \/?\/doain.\"\n5th. That later on, working under the above mentioned disadvantage and wishing for a remedy against laws which affected their rights and privileges, in the matter of education, 4,267 members of the Roman Catholic Church, in the province of Manitoba, on behalf of themselves and their co-religionists, appealed to the Governor General in Council from the said acts of the legislature of the province of Manitoba, the prayer of their petition being as follows:\u2014\n\"(1.) That Your Excellency, the Governor General in Council, may entertain the said appeal, and may consider the same, and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought proper. \"(2.) That it may be declared that such Provincial law does prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province at the union.\n\"(3.) That such directions may be given and provisions made for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the Province of Manitoba, as to Your Excellency in Council may seem fit.\"\n6th. That in the month of March, 1891, the Cardinal Archbishop of Quebec and the Archbishops and Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, in a petition to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, shew that the 7th Legislature of the Province of Manitoba, in its 3rd session assembled, had passed an Act intituled: \"An Act respecting the Department of Education,\" and another Act to be cited: \"The Public School Act,\" which deprived the Catholic minority of the province of the rights and privileges they enjoyed with regard to education; and the venerable prelates added:\u2014\"Therefore your petitioners humbly pray Your Excellency in Council to afford a remedy to the pernicious legislation above mentioned, and that in the most efficacious and just way.\"\n7th. That on the 21st March, 1891, the Honourable the Minister of Justice reported on the two Acts alluded to above, cap. 37, \"An Act respecting the Department of Education,\" and cap. 38, \"An Act respecting Public Schools,\" and here are the conclusions of his report:\u2014 \"If the legal controversy should result in the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (adverse to Catholic views) being sustained, the time will come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, quoted in the early part of this report, and which are analogous to the provisions made by the British North America Act in relation to the other provinces.\n\"Those subsections contain in effect the provisions which have been made as to all the provinces, and are obviously those under which the constitution intended that the Government of the Dominion should proceed if it should at any time become necessary that the Federal powers should be resorted to for the protection of a Protestant or Roman Catholic minority against any act or decision of the Legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority, affecting any 'right or privilege' of any such minority 'in relation to education.'\"\nA committee of the Honourable the Privy Council having had under consideration the above report submitted the same for approval, and it was approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 4th of April, 1891.\n8th. That the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council has sustained the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench.\n9th. That your petitioner believes that the time has now \"come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba, for redress, under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act\" as it has \"become necessary that the Federal power should be resorted to for the protection of the Roman Catholic minority.\"\nYour petitioner therefore prays\u2014\n1. That Your Excellency the Governor General in Council may entertain the appeal of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba, and may consider the same, and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought proper. 2. That such directions may be given and provisions made for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba as to Your Excellency in Council may seem fit.\nAnd your petitioner will ever pray.\n\u2020 ALEX.

Mr. LaRivi\u00e8re, M.P., St. Boniface.\nSir,\u2014In behalf of the National Congress, organized, 24th June, 1890, I beg to request that you will transmit to His Excellency the Governor General in Council the inclosed petition asking the Dominion Government to consider the petitions already presented by the Catholics of this province, with a view to obtaining redress of the grievances inflicted upon them in the matter of education, by the provincial legislation of Manitoba, in 1890.\nI have the honour, &c.,\nT. A. BERNIER,\nPres. pro tem.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\nThe humble petition of the undersigned members of the Roman Catholic Church, in the province of Manitoba, and dutiful subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty, doth hereby respectfully represent that:\u2014\nThe seventh legislature of the province of Manitoba, in its third session assembled, did pass in the year eighteen hundred and ninety an act intituled \"An Act respecting the Department of Education,\" and also an act respecting public schools, which deprive the Roman Catholic minority in the said province of Manitoba of the rights and privileges they enjoyed with regard to education previous to and at the time of the union, and since that time up to the passing of the acts aforesaid.\nThat subsequent to the passing of said acts, and on behalf of the members of said Roman Catholic Church, the following petition has been laid before Your Excellency in Council:\u2014\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\nThe humble petition of the undersigned members of the Roman Catholic Church, in the province of Manitoba, presented on behalf of themselves and their co-religionists in the said province, sheweth as follows:\u2014\n1. Prior to the passage of the Act of the Dominion of Canada, passed in the thirty-third year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, chapter three, known as the Manitoba Act, and prior to the Order in Council issued in pursuance thereof, there existed, in the territory now constituting the province of Manitoba, a number of effective schools for children.\n2. These schools were denominational schools, some of them being regulated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, and others by various Protestant denominations.\n3. The means necessary for the support of the Roman Catholic schools were supplied to some extent by school fees paid by some of the parents of the children who attended the schools and the rest was paid out of the funds of the church contributed by its members.\n4. During the period referred to Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of the Protestant denominations, and the Protestant denominations had no interest in or control over the schools of the Roman Catholics. There were no public schools in the sense of state schools. The members of the Roman Catholic Church supported the schools of their own church for the benefit of the Roman Catholic children and were not under obligation to, and did not, contribute to the support of any other schools.\n5. In the matter of education, therefore, during the period referred to, Roman Catholics were as a matter of custom and practice separate from the rest of the community.\n6. Under the provisions of the Manitoba Act it was provided that the Legislative Assembly of the province should have the exclusive right to make laws in regard to education, subject to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1.) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the union.\n(2.) An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the Legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n(3.) In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor General in Council, or any appeal under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then, and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section, and of any decision of the Governor General under this section.\n7. During the first session of the Legislative Assembly of the province of Manitoba an act was passed relating to education, the effect of which was to continue to the Roman Catholics that separate condition with reference to education which they had enjoyed previous to the erection of the province.\n8. The effect of the statute, so far as the Roman Catholics were concerned, was merely to organize the efforts which the Roman Catholics had previously voluntarily made for the education of their own children. It provided for the continuance of schools under the sole control and management of Roman Catholics, and of the education of their children according to the methods by which alone they believe children should be instructed.\n9. Ever since the said legislation, and until the last session of the legislative assembly, no attempt was made to encroach upon the rights of the Roman Catholics so confirmed to them as above mentioned, but during said session statutes were passed (53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38) the effect of which was to deprive the Roman Catholics altogether of their separate condition in regard to education; to merge their schools with those of the Protestant denominations; and to require all members of the community, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to contribute, through taxation, to the support of what are therein called public schools, but which are in reality a continuation of the Protestant schools.\n10. There is a provision in the said act for the appointment and election of an advisory board, and also for the election in each municipality of school trustees. There is also a provision that the said advisory board may prescribe religious exercises for use in schools, and that the said school trustees may, if they think fit, direct such religious exercises to be adopted in the schools in their respective districts. No further or other provision is made with reference to religious exercises, and there is none with reference to religious training.\n11. Roman Catholics regard such schools as unfit for the purposes of education, and the children of Roman Catholic parents cannot and will not attend any such schools. Rather than countenance such schools Roman Catholics will revert to the voluntary system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will at their own private expense establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and their faith, although by so doing they will have in addition thereto to contribute to the expense of the so-called public schools.\n12. Your petitioners submit that the said act of the legislative assembly of Manitoba is subversive of the rights of Roman Catholics guaranteed and confirmed to them by the statute erecting the province of Manitoba, and prejudicially affects the rights and privileges with respect to Roman Catholic schools which Roman Catholics had in the province at the time of its union with the Dominion of Canada. 13. Roman Catholics are in minority in said province.\n14. The Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba therefore appeal from the said act of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.\nYour Petitioners therefore pray\u2014\n1. That Your Excellency the Governor General in Council may entertain the said appeal, and may consider the same, and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought proper.\n2. That it may be declared that such provincial law does prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province at the union.\n3. That such directions may be given and provisions made for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the Province of Manitoba as to Your Excellency in Council may seem fit.\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\n\u2020Alex., Arch. of St. Boniface.\nHenri F., Ev. d'Anemour.\nJoseph Messier, P.P. of St. Boniface.\nT. A. Bernier.\nJ. Dubuc.\nL. A. Prud'homme.\nM. A. Girard.\nA. A. LaRivi\u00e8re, M.P.\nJames E. Prendergast, M.P.P.\nRoger Marion, M.P.P.,\nand 4,257 more names.\nThat on the consideration by the Privy Council of Canada of the two Acts aforesaid, the following report of the Honourable the Minister of Justice, dated 21st March, 1891, was approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 4th of April, 1891, viz.:\u2014\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,\nCanada, 21st March, 1891.\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\nThe undersigned has the honour to report upon the two Acts of the following titles passed by the Legislature of the Province of Manitoba at its session held in the year 1890, which Acts were received by the Honourable the Secretary of State on the 11th April, 1890:\u2014\nChapter 37, \"An Act respecting the Department of Education,\" and chapter 38, \"An Act respecting the Public Schools.\"\nThe first of these Acts creates a Department of Education, consisting of the Executive Council or a Committee thereof appointed by the Lieutenant-Grovernor in Council, and defines its powers. It also creates an Advisory Board, partly appointed by the Department of Education and partly elected by teachers, and defines its powers. Also.\nThe \"Act respecting Public Schools\" is a consolidation and amendment of all previous legislation in respect to public schools. It repeals all legislation which created and authorized a system of separate schools for Protestants and Roman Catholics. By the Acts previously in force either Protestants or Roman Catholics could establish a school in any school district, and Protestant ratepayers were exempted from contribution for the Catholic schools, and Catholic ratepayers were exempted from contribution for Protestant schools.\nThe two Acts now under review purport to abolish these distinctions as to the schools, and these exemptions as to ratepayers, and to establish instead a system under which public schools are to be organized in all the schools districts, without regard to the religious views of the ratepayers. The right of the province of Manitoba to legislate on the subject of education is conferred by the act which created the province, viz., 32-33 Vic., chap. 3 (The Manitoba Act), section 22, which is as follows:\u2014\n\"22. In and for the province of Manitoba the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject to the following provisions:\u2014\n\"(1.) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the union.\n\"(2.) An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from the Act or decision of the legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n\"(3.) In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor in Council, on any appeal under this section, is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then, and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section, and of any decision of the Governor General in Council under this section.\"\nIn the year 1870, when the \"Manitoba Act\" was passed there existed no system of education established or authorized by law, but at the first session of the provincial legislature in 1871 an \"Act to establish a system of education in the province\" was passed. By that act the Lieutenant Governor in Council was empowered to appoint not less than ten or more than fourteen to be a Board of Education for the province, of whom one-half were to be Protestants and the other half Catholics, with one superintendent of Protestant and one superintendent of Catholic schools. The Board was divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic, each section to have under its control and management the discipline of the schools of its faith, and to prescribe the books to be used in the schools under its care which had reference to religion or morals.\nThe moneys appropriated for education by the legislature were to be divided equally, one moiety thereof to the support of Protestant schools, and the other moiety to the support of Catholic schools.\nBy an act passed in 1875 the board was increased to twenty-one, twelve Protestants and nine Roman Catholics; the moneys voted by the legislature were to be divided between the Protestant and Catholic schools in proportion to the number of children of school age in the schools under the care of Protestant and Catholic sections of the board respectively.\nThe Act of 1875 also provided that the establishment in a school district of a school of one denomination should not prevent the establishment of a school of another denomination in the same district.\nSeveral questions have arisen as to the validity and effect of the two statutes now under review; among those are the following:\u2014\nIt being admitted that \"no class of persons\" (to use the expression of the Manitoba Act), had \"by law\" at the time the province was established, \"any right or privilege with respect to denominational (or any other) school,\" had \"any class of persons\" any such right or privilege with respect to denominational schools \"by practice\" at that time? Did the existence of separate schools for Roman Catholic children, supported by Roman Catholic voluntary contributions, in which their religion might be taught and in which text books suitable for Roman Catholic schools were used, and the non-existence of any system by which Roman Catholics, or any other, could be compelled to contribute for the support of schools, constitute a \"right or privilege\" for Roman Catholics \"by practice\" within the meaning of the Manitoba Act? The former of these, as will at once be seen, was a question of fact and the latter a question of law based on the assumption, which has since been proved to be well founded, that the existence of separate schools at the time of the \"union\" was the fact on which the Catholic population of Manitoba must rely as establishing their \"right or privilege\" \"by practice.\" The remaining question was whether, assuming the foregoing questions, or either of them, to require an affirmative answer, the enactments now under review, or either of them, affected any such \"right or privilege.\"\nIt became apparent at the outset that these questions required the decision of the judicial tribunals, more especially as an investigation of facts was necessary to their determination. Proceedings were instituted with a view to obtaining such a decision in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba several months ago, and in course of these proceedings the facts have been easily ascertained, and the two latter of the three questions above stated were presented for the judgment of that court with the arguments of counsel for the Roman Catholics of Manitoba on the one side, and of counsel for the provincial government on the other.\nThe court has practically decided, with one dissentient opinion, that the acts now under review do not \"prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools\" which Roman Catholics had \"by practice at the time of the union,\" or, in brief, that the non-existence, at that time, of a system of public schools and the consequent exemption from taxation for the support of public schools and the consequent freedom to establish and support separate or \"denominational\" schools did not constitute a \"right or privilege\" \"by practice\" which these acts took away.\nAn appeal has been asserted and the case is now before the Supreme Court of Canada, where it will, in all probability, be heard in the course of next month.\nIf the appeal should be successful these acts will be annulled by judicial decision; the Roman Catholic minority of Manitoba will receive protection and redress. The acts purporting to be repealed will remain in operation, and those whose views have been represented by a majority of the Legislature cannot but recognize that the matter has been disposed of with due regard to the constitutional rights of the province.\nIf the legal controversy should result in the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench being sustained the . time will come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the \"Manitoba Act\" quoted in the early part of this report and which are analogous to the provisions made by the British North America Act in relation to the other provinces.\nThose subsections contain in effect the provisions which have been made as to all the provinces and are obviously those under which the constitution intended that the Government of the Dominion should proceed if it should at any time become necessary that the Federal powers should be resorted to for the protection of a Protestant or Roman Catholic minority against any Act or decision of the Legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority, affecting any \"right or privilege\" of any such minority \"in relation to education.\"\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN S. D. THOMPSON,\nMinister of Justice. That a recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England having sustained the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba, upholding the validity of the Acts aforesaid, your petitioners most respectfully represent that, as intimated in said report of the Honourable the Minister of Justice, the time has now come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the \"Manitoba Act.\"\nThat your petitioners, notwithstanding such decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England, still believe that their rights and privileges in relation to education have been prejudicially affected by said Acts of the Provincial Legislature.\nTherefore, your petitioners most respectfully and most earnestly pray that it may please Your Excellency in Council to take into consideration the petitions above referred to, and to grant the conclusions of said petitions and the relief and protection sought for by the same.\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\nSaint Boniface, 20th September, 1892.\nMembers of the Executive Committee of the National Congress.\nT.

I do not desire that this petition should be substituted for the others already presented, but that it should rather be taken as supplementary to those others. May I ask that the matter may be brought before His Excellency the Governor General in Council at the earliest possible date?\nI have, &c.,\nJOHN S. EWART.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\nThe humble petition of the members of the Roman Catholic Church residing in the Province of Manitoba sheweth as follows:\u2014\n1. Prior to the passage of the Act of the Dominion of Canada, passed in the 33rd year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, chap. 3, known as the Manitoba Act, and prior to the Order in Council issued in pursuance thereof, there existed in the territory now constituting the Province of Manitoba a number of effective schools for children.\n2. These schools were denominational schools, some of them being regulated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, and others by various Protestant denominations.\n3. The means necessary for the support of the Roman Catholic schools were supplied to some extent by school fees paid by some of the parents of the children who attended the schools, and the rest was paid out of the funds of the church contributed by its members.\n4. During the period referred to Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of the Protestant denominations, and the members of the Protestant denominations had no interest in or control over the schools of the Roman Catholics. There were no public schools in the sense of State schools. The members of the Roman Catholic Church supported the schools of their own church for the benefit of Roman Catholic children and were not under obligation to, and did not, contribute to the support of any other schools.\n5. In the matter of education, therefore, during the period referred to, Roman Catholics were as a matter of custom and practice separate from the rest of the community.\n6. Under the provisions of the Manitoba Act it was provided that the Legislative Assembly of the province should have the exclusive right to make laws in regard to education, subject, however, and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n\"(1.) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the union.\n\"(2.) An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or decision of the Legislature of the province, or of any provincial authority, affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n\"(3.) In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor General in Council on any appeal under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then, and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section, and of any decision of the Governor General under this section.\"\n7. During the first session of the Legislative Assembly of the province of Manitoba an act was passed relating to education, the effect of which was to continue to the Roman Catholics that separate condition with reference to education which they had enjoyed previous to the erection of the province.\n8. The effect of this statute, so far as the Roman Catholics were concerned, was merely to organize the efforts which Roman Catholics had previously voluntarily made for the education of their own children. It provided for the continuance of schools under the sole control and management of Roman Catholics, and for the education of their children according to the methods by which alone they believe children should be instructed. Between the time of the passage of the said act, and prior to the statute next hereinafter referred to, various acts were passed amending and consolidating the said act, but in and by all such later acts the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholics were acknowledged and conserved and their separate condition in respect to education continued.\n9. Until the session of the Legislative Assembly held in the year 1890 no attempt was made to encroach upon the rights of the Roman Catholics so confirmed to them as above mentioned, but during said session statutes were passed (53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38) the effect of which was to repeal all the previous acts; to deprive the Roman Catholics altogether of their separate condition in regard to education; to merge their schools with those of the Protestant denomination; and to require all members of the community, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to contribute, through taxation, to the support of what are therein called public schools, but which are in reality a continuation of the Protestant schools.\n10. There is a provision in the said act for the appointment and election of an advisory board, and also for the election in each district of school trustees. There is also a provision that the said advisory board may prescribe religious exercises for use in schools, and that the said school trustees may, if they think fit, direct such religious exercises to be adopted in the schools in their respective districts. No further or other provision is made with reference to religious exercises, and there is none with reference to religious training.\n11. Roman Catholics regard such schools as unfit for the purposes of education, and the children of the Roman Catholic parents cannot and will not attend any such schools. Rather than countenance such schools Roman Catholics will revert to the voluntary system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will at their own private expense establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and their faith, although by so doing they will have in addition thereto to contribute to the expense of the so-called public schools.\n12. Your petitioners submit that the said acts of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba are subversive of the rights of the Roman Catholics guaranteed and confirmed to them by the statute erecting the province of Manitoba, and prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with respect to Roman Catholic schools which Roman Catholics had in the province at the time of its union with the Dominion of Canada. 13. Your petitioners further submit that the said acts of the legislative assembly of Manitoba are subversive of the rights and privileges of Roman Catholics provided for by the various statutes of the said legislative assembly prior to the passing of the said acts and affect the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in the said province in relation to education so provided for as aforesaid, thereby offending both against the British North America Act and the Manitoba Act.\n14. Roman Catholics are in a minority in the said province, and have been so for the last fifteen years.\n15. The Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba, therefore, appeal from the said acts of the legislative assembly of the province of Manitoba.\nYour petitioners therefore pray\u2014\n1. That Your Excellency the Governor General in Council may entertain the said appeal and may consider the same, and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought proper.\n2. That it may be declared that the said acts (53 Vic. chaps. 37 and 38) do prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province at the union.\n3. That it may be declared that the said last mentioned acts do affect the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n4. That it may be declared that to Your Excellency the Governor General in Council it seems requisite that the provisions of the statutes in force in the province of Manitoba prior to the passage of the said acts should be re-enacted, in so far at least as may be necessary to secure to the Roman Catholics in the said province the right to build, maintain, equip, manage, conduct and support their schools in the manner provided for by the said statutes, to secure to them their proportionate share of any grant made out of the public funds for the purposes of education, and to relieve such members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholic schools from all payment or contribution to the support of any other schools; or that the said Acts of 1890 should be so modified or amended as to effect such purposes.\n5. And that such further or other declaration or order may be made as to Your Excellency the Governor General in Council shall, under the circumstances, seem proper, and that such directions may be given, provisions made and all things done in the premises for the purpose of affording relief to the said Roman Catholic minority in the said province as to Your Excellency in Council may seem meet.\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\n\u2020 Alex., Arch. of St. Boniface, O.M.I.\nT.

Ewart, Counsel for the Roman Catholic minority in the Province of Manitoba.\nTHE MANITOBA SCHOOL LAW.\nThe Conservative League, faithful to the enduring traditions of the Conservative party, wishes to record its regret that good feeling and a spirit of conciliation, so essential to the well-being of our public affairs, do not actuate the Government and the majority of the people of Manitoba; it regrets that, in the name of \"Equal Rights,\" liberty of conscience, justice and equality of rights have been denied by the school law of 1890 to a very large portion of the inhabitants of that province.\nIn common with every citizen of the province of Quebec this League has the right to make itself heard on this question, because the province of Quebec accepted confederation only on the express condition that the rights of minorities would be respected and kept safe. Therefore it is that the League asserts itself to vindicate its principles and to defend the privileges and immunities of the minority in Manitoba.\nThe education of children is the exclusive province of the father of the family, and their education devolves on him as a matter of strict duty. It follows as a necessary consequence from this principle that the father of a family has the undeniable right to fulfil this duty according to the dictates of his conscience, that in the exercise of this duty and of this right the State has no lawful power to interfere with or restrict his freedom of action, and that any law which tends to trammel such free action is offensive to good conscience.\nThe Manitoba School Law of 1890 is a usurpation by the State of the rights of the pater familias. It is an Act subversive of his rights,\u2014it is an abuse of power inspired by intolerance and fanaticism and is of a nature to inspire fear for the very existence of confederation if a remedy be not applied in good time.\nNo one can honestly deny the treaty of 1870, between the Government of Canada and the people of Manitoba, by which it was formally covenanted and agreed that their separate schools should be preserved to them. Nor can any one with honesty deny that the Manitoba School law of 1871, made and adopted by the very men who had themselves been parties to the treaty of the year before, maintained these separate schools for Catholics and Protestants. And yet, the highest tribunal in England took into account neither the solemn treaty of 1870, nor the unequivocal interpretation of that treaty contained in the law of 1871.\nFor a moment only let the opposite state of things be supposed; let us suppose that a French Catholic majority in Manitoba refused separate schools to a Protestant minority. Who will believe that in such a state of things the Privy Council would have interpreted the Manitoba treaty in the same sense? Their Lordships would have shewn that our Catholic good faith, that our national honour were solemnly bound. They would have been eloquent in defence of the liberty of the citizens and learned as to the rights belonging to a father of a family; and they would have been right. But the supposition is altogether unfounded, for French Canadians have ever given constant proof, not in mere words but by deed and practice, of the truest liberality towards the Protestant minority of the province of Quebec. Fair play deserves fair play in return.\nBut there is more than this to be said. The Treaty of Paris (1763) fixed the conditions of the cession of Canada to England, and by this treaty England promised that the people of this country should remain free in the exercise of the Catholic religion. But, since it is obligatory for the Catholic to give his children a religious education, it follows that to banish religious instruction from the primary school is to deny him the right to obey the precepts of his religion, and this can only be done in violation of the exacted promise on the faith of which Canada became a British colony.\nFor these reasons the Conservative League protests against the school law in force in Manitoba, and expresses the hope that our statesmen and public men will labour manfully and uncompromisingly until these laws shall have been remedied.\nAnother question arises out of this subject, and claims our earnest attention. The present crisis would have been avoided if the Privy Council in England had rendered a decision according to equity, and based on the true state of the case. Unfortunately in the present instance, as in every other where the interests of the Catholics of this country and of the French Canadians have been involved, that high tribunal has rendered an arbitrary judgment. Since unhappily this appears to be true, it is most opportune to consider whether Indeed the Privy Council has jurisdiction in such matters and to have it taken away if it exists: for the time has gone by and is past when a country or a people can be made to suffer injustice indefinitely.\nMONTREAL, 3rd November, 1892.\nTHE CONSERVATIVE LEAGUE.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF CANADA,\nOTTAWA, 26th September, 1892.\nMY LORD ARCHBISHOP,\u2014I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, transmitting for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General a petition concerning the appeal of the Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba with regard to education, and to state that the matter will receive consideration.\nI have, &c.,\nL.

A. CATELLIER,\nUnder Secretary of State.\nThe following are the statutes of Manitoba referred to and relating to, the subject of education:\u2014\n34 Victoria (1871), Chap. XII., \"An Act to establish a system of education in this province.\"\n36 Victoria (1873), Chap. XXII., \"An Act to amend the Act to establish a system of education in this province.\"\n39 Victoria (1876), Chap.

XXXVIII., \"An Act respecting Public Schools.\"\nOn the 4th October, 1893, the Solicitor General of the Dominion of Canada submitted the case to the court. Ewart Q.C. being present on behalf of the petitioners, and there being no person present to represent the Province of Manitoba, the Chief Justice stated that the court in exercise of the powers conferred by 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25, sec. 4, substituted for sec. 37 R. S. C. c. 135, would direct the registrar to request C. Robinson Q.C., the senior member of the Ontario bar, to appear and argue the case as to any interest of the Province of Manitoba which is affected.\nOn October 17, 1893, the case having been called:\u2014\nSolicitor-General Curran:\u2014My learned friends, representing the other parties, are ready.\nMr. Ewart:\u2014I appear for the petitioners, my lords.\nMr. Robinson:\u2014I appear, under the statute, by direction of the court.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014You represent Manitoba Mr. Robinson? It is just as well to know whom you represent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: \u2014You appear under the statute?\nMr. Robinson:\u2014I appear, under the statute, by direction of the court.\nMr. Wade:\u2014I appear on behalf of the Province of Manitoba. I desire to state, that while Manitoba appears here it is simply to acknowledge that the Province has been served with a copy of the case by the Clerk of the Privy Council, and not to take any part in the argument; I appear, out of deference to the court, to acknowledge that the Province has been served.\nI might say further, my lords, as to Mr. Robinson, that the Province does not know him in the matter. The argument of the case was then proceeded with.\nEwart Q.C. for the petitioners. Under the 22nd section of the Manitoba act there may be two readings, viz., in the first place, that which would make of the first two subsections two limitations of the jurisdiction of the province; the other reading would be that which would make the first subsection a limitation of the jurisdiction, and the second subsection the remedy which was provided in case of excess of jurisdiction.\nIn the view that I have the honour of submitting to your lordships the former of these two is the correct reading, that there are two limitations in these two subsections, and not merely a limitation in the first and a remedy provided in the second.\nUnder the first subsection of section 22 of the Manitoba act I beg to point out that a statute which offends against it is ultra vires. Then, it would seem to be an extraordinary thing that after the first subsection declares something to be ultra vires the second subsection should provide for an appeal from that statute, because, if the statute is ultra vires, there is no necessity of appealing from it at all, in fact there is nothing to appeal from, it has no operation, there is nothing upon which an appeal would rest. That is rendered stronger when one considers the third subsection, which is the complement, as it were, of the second subsection and provides what is to be done upon that appeal. Remedial legislation may follow upon that appeal. It would be in the last degree absurd if, starting with an ultra vires statute, we were to have, not only an appeal from it but remedial legislation in consequence of it.\nI would further illustrate it in this way: The present Manitoba statute of 1890 has been held to be intra vires; supposing it had been held to be ultra vires we could not ask remedial legislation; there is nothing to remedy; we could not say that any of our rights and privileges had been affected.; the statute is ultra vires, it has done nothing; there can be no appeal, and there can be no remedial legislation. Then again, under the British North America Act, which in every respect is in pari materia with the Manitoba Act, that is clearly the law as to the other provinces.\nThere the first subsection provides for a limitation of the jurisdiction of the legislature; it shall not prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons has by law in the province at the union. That is almost the same as the wording of the Manitoba act. The third subsection also, which corresponds with the second in the Manitoba act, provides for cases where separate or dissentient schools have existed at the time of the union, or are thereafter established; there is to be an appeal to the Governor General in Council.\nUnder that statute it seems to me that the appeal provided for is not what is provided for in the first subsection, that what is provided for in the first subsection is that something is to be ultra vires. Then, if it is not ultra vires, what can you do? If you feel yourself aggrieved at any time during any period of the subsequent history of any of the provinces in which separate schools existed at the time of the union, or were thereafter established, you can appeal if your rights which existed at any time during that period are interfered with.\nI wish further, in support of that argument that those two subsections are dealing with different matters and different sets of cases, to point out the difference between them in two or three respects. If it is intended that the appeal is to lie in case of a breach of the first subsection then we would certainly find that the person to appeal under the second subsection was the person injured under the first. It would not be possible that the person to appeal would be a different person from the person affected under the first subsection, and yet, when one looks at the first subsection, we see \"that no right or privilege\" whether of the majority or the minority, is to be affected. If any right or privilege, either of the majority or the minority, is affected the act is ultra vires but who can appeal? It is only a member of the minority that can appeal. If it is claimed that the act is ultra vires then any member of the community can set the law in motion and contend that the act is ultra vires. If this appeal that is given is intended to be from an ultra vires statute then there is this extraordinary thing, a great many people who can be hurt under the first subsection cannot appeal under the second; for instance, Mr. Logan, who took action against this very statute, under the first subsection, claiming that the act was ultra vires, was not a member of the minority but was a member of the majority. He had a perfect right under the first subjection to go into the court and question the intra vires character of the statute, but he could not be an appellant, such as we are, because, under the second subsection, it is only given to a member of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority. So that we would have the extraordinary case of there being a wrong, and the remedy being given in favour of some person who was not wronged. Under the first subsection, Mr. Logan, as a member of the community, as a member of the Church of England, in that capacity, moved the courts to take action, but, under the second subsection, your lordships will see that it is only a member of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority that can appeal. That seems to me to be a very strong argument to show that these sections are dealing with different cases.\nA further argument in the same line is this:\u2014That the rights which are to be interfered with under the two sections are different rights, or may be different rights; not only is the appellant, possibly, a different person, but what he has to appeal in respect of may be different, under the two sections. If under the first subsection, it is only in case rights which existed at the union are interfered with; and, under the second subsection, any right or privilege is dealt with, no matter when it arises.\nThe next point that I submit to your lordships, and perhaps the principal one, is, whether an appeal is given in respect of rights which arose subsequent to the union, or whether the statute is limited to rights which existed at the time of the union.\nI quite admit we have no right or privilege which was infringed upon prior to the union; we say we have rights or privileges subsequent, and in respect of those we have an appeal. I say this statute applies to that, and I refer to the analogous section of the British North America Act, and I say it is perfectly clear that that section, at all events, covers the case of rights and privileges arising subsequent to the union; sec. 93, subsec. 3. Your lordships will observe that it applies to cases in which separate schools are established in a province for the first time subsequent to the union. For instance, if New Brunswick to-day were to establish a system of separate schools, it would come under subsec. 3, sec. 93.\nNow, it is perfectly evident, I submit, that New Brunswick, having no separate school system at the time of the union, might establish one after the union; then that would be a case within this statute. Rights and privileges would be given to the Roman Catholic minority by that statute subsequent to the union, and there would be an appeal from an infringement of any of the rights and privileges given by that statute. That seems perfectly clear under the British North America Act. It is a provision similar to various provisions under our charter, under the British North America Act, for the supersession, by the Dominion, of acts of the local legislatures. We know that with reference to railways the Dominion Parliament may declare railways, and did declare all railways, even built by provinces, to be for the general benefit of Canada, and so swept all the railways, generally speaking, outside of the jurisdiction of the provinces. We know that under our decisions in bankruptcy and insolvency numbers of provincial statutes may be passed providing for various things, but if the Dominion legislates upon these subjects the Dominion legislation supersedes the other legislation. We have a particularly good example of that with reference to agriculture and immigration, under sec. 93 of the British North America Act, two subjects that one would think peculiarly came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province, and yet it is provided that: \"Any law of the legislature of a province relative to agriculture or to immigration shall have effect in and for the province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any act of the Parliament of Canada.\" In other words, that the law is not the law of the United States where every State is supreme, where the residuum, as it were, of the legislation is given to it, but that the legislatures here act under restricted charters, and that large supervisory powers have been retained by the Dominion in the way of disallowance, in the way of appeal, in the way of supersession of its legislation, bankruptcy, insolvency and a great many subjects; and so I say it is not opposed to the general scope and the genius of the British North America Act if we find that in such a subject as education there is a limitation upon the right of a province, having once accorded to a religious minority in the province certain rights and privileges under which they may have obtained large vested rights, accumulated large properties, that the British North America Act should say to the majority those rights are not to be ruthlessly swept away; while you have a right to legislate with reference to it it is always subject to an appeal to the Executive of the Dominion, and then to the final arbitrament of the general Parliament.\nThen, my first point is that all the other Provinces are in the position that Manitoba is to-day; that is, if there were separate schools at the union then there is an appeal; if separate schools are established since the union, then there is an appeal in respect of any rights and privileges given subsequent to the union, because they could not have been given prior.\nOtherwise, that clause clearly means nothing. It seems to me the scope of it is clearly this: The Province may hereafter give to minorities certain privileges'; it may have given them prior to the union, or it may think proper to give them after the union; why should there be an appeal in the one case and none in the other? It does not matter, so far as the principle of appeal is concerned, whether given prior to or subsequent to the union, the principle being that rights or privileges having been accorded at one time are not to be ruthlessly swept away without an appeal.\nAnother argument in support of this present point, that the appeal arises in respect of rights after the union, is to be derived from a consideration of how rights and privileges may arise? How can rights and privileges arise, such as are contemplated, in the first place, by the British North America Act? Under the British North America Act the rights and privileges referred to, no doubt, are those which have arisen by statute, that is, not by constitutional acts, but by ordinary statutes of the different provinces. Those acts may have been passed prior to the union, they may be passed subsequent to the union, that seems to make no difference under the British North America Act; then, why should it make any difference under the Manitoba Act? It says, an appeal shall lie from any act affecting any right or privilege. It does not say when that right or privilege came into being, it does not limit it and say it must be a right or privilege which existed at the time of the union. Quite the contrary. If your lordships will observe, the words \"at the union\" are left out of this second subsection. Under the first subsection, in order that a statute may be ultra vires, rights and privileges which existed at the union must be affected; but there may be an appeal no matter when any right or privilege arose.\nManitoba's Constitutional Act is intended to last, not for a year or two but for all time, with perhaps modifications. It seems to me it would be absurd to argue that Manitoba may go on legislating with reference to education for say 50 years, by which time a perfectly new system has been established, something that perhaps we have not conceived of at the present time but something agreeable to all parties, and then in the 51st year to say, that all that is reversed, and when we desire to appeal to have it said, let us go back to the union and see what your rights were at that time. That is not the case at all. It is not the rights and privileges which existed at the union that we have an appeal in respect of, but the rights and privileges which have accrued to us subsequent to that, and which existed at that time. It would seem to me as reasonable to say that your lordships' court, having jurisdiction on appeal from all final judgments of a court, were not to entertain appeals from judgments decided after your lordships' constituting act. Your lordships are given jurisdiction of appeal from every judgment, no matter when it has been decided. These rights and privileges arising by statute are prior to or after the union. Now, if we are limited to a statute passed prior to the union, that is, if we can only appeal in respect of rights and privileges which were given to us by a statute prior to the union, of course there is no such thing, and Parliament, when it passed this statute, knew there was no such thing, and so there would be no appeal at all; the only possible case in which there is an appeal is from a statute which is passed after the union giving rights and privileges, and therefore the appeal here, unless the provision is nugatory altogether, must be an appeal in respect of rights and privileges subsequent to the union.\nI would venture to suggest an analogous case to this, provided for by subsection 2, which provides for an appeal from \"any Act or decision affecting any right or privilege.\" Supposing a statute provided, if any one interfered with another man's right to a property that there should be a certain redress, would it be argued for an instant that that statute only applied to rights which existed at the time of the statute? It is intended to apply, I should think, clearly, to any interference with rights no matter when the rights arise; it is always a question of whether rights were interfered with, not a question of when they came into being.\nI wish to cite to your lordships two cases upon this point. Attorney-General v. Saggers[1]; Lane v. Cotton[2].\nThere is one more matter to which I wish to call attention upon this point, as to whether the rights and privileges referred to in subsection 2 are those which arose subsequent to the union or not, and that is this: that an appeal is given, not only from an act of the legislature, but from the decision of any provincial authority, and I would submit then, that under that part of the section, if we were administering this present statute of 1890, there would be an appeal from its wrongful administration. Supposing we had any rights under this present act of 1890, that would be a case within this section for an appeal from its wrongful administration. It seems to me that it could not have been intended to limit it to statutes which existed at the time of the union, but it was clearly intended to give a right of appeal from wrongful administration of statutes existing at a subsequent time, otherwise there would be really no appeal from administration at all; as soon as one statute was repealed, and another statute passed, they would say, well, there was a right of appeal from the administration under that old statute, but there was no right of appeal from the administration under this present statute. It seems to me it is a constitutional statute, intended to give a right of appeal from wrongful administration at any time. The rights and privileges spoken of here are the rights and privileges as they exist from time to time.\nI will now deal with the question as to whether rights and privileges have been in any way prejudicially affected; and of course in entering upon this discussion we must observe what the Privy Council decided in Barrett v Winnipeg[3]\nThe effect of 53 Vic. ch. 38 was that all the Roman Catholic schools, all their property, all their arrangements of every kind came under this new statute, and became what they call public schools. All their organization was swept away; everything was swept into this new arrangement. A provision is made by two or three sections at the close of the statute with reference to assets and liabilities (sec. 108 and following sections), but your lordships will observe that those sections only relate to the very few cases in which the boundaries of a Roman Catholic and a Protestant school district were identical. It provided for only those two or three cases. In every other case section 3 applies, and everything comes under the new school act\nSo that I say the rights and privileges which have been interfered with are, in the first place, that all properties which we had are swept away, our separate condition, our organization, our right to self-government, our right to taxation for our own purposes, our right to share in government grants, all the rights incident to the condition of separate schools have been taken away from us.\nI would also, upon that point, refer your lordships to the judgments of this court when the case was before your lordships before.\nOne other point remains. The fourth question which has been referred to your lordships may or may not turn out to be material; at all events your lordships are asked to give an answer to it.\nThe clause which seems to govern the answer to that question is the second section of the Manitoba Act.\nI submit the British North America Act does apply to Manitoba, and for this reason:\u2014I submit that one statute does not vary another, if it merely makes further provisions. For instance, if a statute provided that certain acts shall constitute theft, and then another act provided that a certain other thing shall constitute theft, that would not be a variation of the previous statute, it would be an addition to it. I argue in the same way here with reference to this second subsection, that it is wider, that it does not vary at all the third subsection of the British North America Act, save in this, that there is an addition to it, that it is inclusive and goes beyond it. The third subsection of the British North America Act provides that in two cases there is to be an appeal. There is nothing inconsistent in the Manitoba Act which says that in all cases there shall be an appeal. It goes beyond it, it does not vary it; it leaves it as it is, and adds to it.\nThere are a number of cases that might be referred to upon this point, but as they are all grouped together I will content myself with giving your lordships the pages at which they are to be found in Maxwell on Statutes[4]. The treatment of the subjects extends beyond the particular pages that I give.\nThere is a case, analogous in some respects, which arose under the statute of Wills of Ontario, Crawford v. Curragh[5].\nROBINSON Q. C.\u2014The subject matter for decision by the court in respect of the various questions on this important matter which have been referred by the Government of the Dominion is, how they should be answered, having reference simply to the construction of this statute. And I take it, that the whole thing depends upon the construction of these two statutes, the British North America Act and the Manitoba Act, taken and read in connection with the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Barrett v. Winnipeg[6].\nI submit that the British North America Act has no application. One would hardly expect it should have any application for this reason, that the subject matter of education is taken up and specially dealt with, as regards other provinces, by the British North America Act; the same subject is taken up and specially dealt with by the Manitoba Act as regards Manitoba; and, one would therefore expect that the provisions to be found in the Manitoba Act were intended to be the complete and the only provisions dealing with that subject matter with regard to that province.\nA difference, and a very marked difference, is plain upon the two statutes.\nI do not concur with my learned friend, if I may venture to say so, when he says that adding to an enactment is not varying it. I should have thought, on the contrary, it was a very plain variation. To suggest a very familiar instance; if you were to say that murder should be a capital crime, I think you would be very materially varying that by saying that other things should be capital crimes. In one case, it is intended to deal with the whole subject of what is a capital felony, and if you were to add larceny to that, or other crimes, I think you would very materially vary it, and, therefore, when we find that particular subject matter dealt with specifically and by itself in the Manitoba Act, dealt with in a different manner from the way in which it is treated in the British North America Act, and when we find in the Manitoba Act a provision that except so far as the British North America Act may be varied by this act it shall be applicable to the Province of Manitoba, I should have thought the inference was very plain.\nI cannot cite authorities upon such a point; it is almost impossible to find them. However, I may refer to a case your lordships may recollect of Major v. The Canadian Pacific Railway[7]. There was a general provision in the Railway Act with respect to building branches, and a special provision in the Canadian Pacific Act. It was contended that that provision in the special Railway Act, in the Canadian Pacific Charter, was varied, and added to, by the general provision of the Railway Act, because it was imported into the Canadian Pacific Charter in very much the same words as the British North America Act is imported here It having been held that that modified the special clause in the Canadian Pacific Act the judgment was reversed on the ground that that was an error.\nIt may be a natural question to ask: Can it have been intended that Manitoba should be in a worse position than the other provinces? I cannot say whether it was to be in a better or a worse position, but the statute very plainly says Manitoba is to be in a different position.\nThere are three questions which my learned friend has suggested which stand apart from the main subject:\nFirst, does the the British North America Act apply?\nSecondly, what is the effect of the distinction between the two statutes, in the introduction of the words \"Provincial authority,\" in one, and the addition in the other of the words \"Acts of the Legislature\"?\nLastly, are the rights and privileges in the Manitoba Act confined to rights and privileges existing at the (union, or do they include rights and privileges subsequent as well?\nThose are three questions which, so to speak, are separated from the main subject. I would like, in a few words, to dispose of them.\nWith regard to those words \"Provincial authority\" your lordships will remember that in section 93 subsection 3, an appeal shall lie from any act or decision of any provincial authority. In the Manitoba Act it is from any act or decision of the Legislature of the Province or of any provincial authority.\"\nNow, one thing is very clear, that whoever framed those two statutes, and we may assume that the Manitoba section was framed in view of the similar section of the British North America Act, evidently had, to say the least of it, a doubt whether the words \"Provincial authority\" included legislation. My learned friend is quite right in saying it may have been only ex majore cautel\u00e2, but possibly for the want of some better reason, it suggests itself to me that perhaps the term \"Provincial authority\" hardly includes legislation, because the act of legislation is the act of the province itself, as it were. That is to say, the legislature, composed of the crown and the representatives of the people, is the province itself. It is not, in ordinary language, a provincial authority. I do not think you speak of the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures, as being respectively Dominion authorities, and provincial authorities. The legislation of the country is the act of the province itself, not of any authority appointed, so to speak, by the province. At all events, we find it clear that there was the addition in the subsequent statute of the specific words which would seem to show that the legislature thought they were not included in the words \"act or decision of provincial authority\" in the first statute. I do not know that more can be said about that. It does not admit of much elaboration. The difference made by the legislature is plain. I suggest the probable reason for it, that it would be doubtful whether a statute of the legislature was an act or decision of a provincial authority. Whether it means an act in the sense of a statute, or an act of a provincial authority, all depends upon whether it is spelled with a capital \"A\" or a small \"a,\" that is the real truth. We are speaking here of very refined distinctions in words. I see it spelled with a capital \"A\" in the statute I have before me, but if it meant an act or a decision of a provincial authority, you do not speak of an act of Parliament as a decision.\nA suggestion occurred to me, that the act of the legislature was not exactly a provincial authority, it was an act of the province itself. I do not know whether an order in council might not be an act of \"Provincial authority.\" There is some difference between the two.\nThen, the next question my learned friend raised was, that the words \"affecting any right or privilege\" means affecting any right or privilege which existed at the union or was subsequently acquired.\nNow, in the first place, we find that in subsection 1, rights and privileges at the union are specifically spoken of. One, therefore, assumes prim\u00e2 facie, that when you find rights and privileges spoken of, with those words omitted, there was to be some sort of distinction and when we come to consider the effect of saying that those words \"rights and privileges\" mean rights and privileges whenever acquired, we are met with this obvious and, I submit, almost insuperable difficulty: it is contrary to all our ideas of legislation, contrary almost to our constitution, that the same legislature which creates cannot destroy. We have no instance of that, except in the British North America Act, that I know of It is contrary to all principles of legislation, it is contrary to all principles of Government, and it is contrary to all constitutional principles if I may express it so strongly, that the same legislature to which you go for the creation of a right, and under which you enjoy the exercise of a right, has no power to deprive you of the right. It must surely, I submit, require most express and specific words to bring about that state of things.\nWhen you add to that, that the insertion or the omission of those words involves a change of the organic law, then the argument becomes stronger that the omission of them cannot be supplied by anything in the shape of implication or construction, because to put them in would lay that the legislature which made a law, and created the right, could not repeal that law, or deprive those to whom they gave the right, of it.\nNow, as to the main question, is there any right of appeal? I will read afterwards to your lordships the six questions, and see what specific answers should be given to them, and what reasons there are for suggesting that they should be answered in an opposite sense from that for which my learned friend contends; but, speaking substantially, he says the answers to all the questions should be in the affirmative. I submit reasons why the answers to the questions should be in the negative, but you may condense it all into one question: Is it competent for our Privy Council to entertain this appeal after the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council?\nI submit that the obvious and plain difficulty in my learned friend's way is, that, as we read, or as I read and suggest to the court, that the judgment of the Judicial Committee should be read, they have decided, practically, that there is no such act to appeal from as is described in the appealing clause. What is it that you have a right to appeal from under the Manitoba Act? Leaving out the immaterial words, you have a right to appeal from any act of the provincial legislature \"affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\"\nWhat I say is this: The Judicial Committee decided that the existence of denominational schools, or the existence of a national system of non-sectarian schools, is in no way inconsistent with the rights and privileges which they have always enjoyed, and still enjoy, with respect to denominational schools.\nOf course, if the section upon which the judicial committee proceeded in their judgment was precisely the same as the present section, there would be nothing more to argue. The question is, whether it is not the same in principle, and whether the principles which they have laid down do not necessarily make it applicable to the section we are now considering. If they do, there is no appeal; if they do not, there is an appeal.\nNow, let us see what the differences are. In the first place, the words in the first subsection are \"prejudicially affect\"; is there any distinction between \"prejudicially affect\" and \"affect\"? In the argument, as my learned friend has mentioned to your lordships, it was said, and said, I submit, with unanswerable force, that there could be no distinction, for present purposes, between \"affecting\" and \"prejudicially affecting\"; in other words, the \"affecting\" which gives a right of appeal must be, in some sense, \"prejudicially affecting.\" Any change, of course, is \"affecting,\" but there could not be a right of appeal from a change enormously adding to their powers. There might be beneficial changes, changes which would give them infinitely greater rights; there could be no appeal there; therefore, I submit, there is no distinction between \"affecting\" and \"prejudicially affecting.\"\nNow, I quite admit that there is, in words, and in more than words, a plain distinction between the words \"rights or privileges with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons has by law or practice in the province at the union,\" and \"any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\" Of course there is a very plain difference between those words and between, in some respects, the meaning of those words; but, in the first place, speaking of the words \"in relation to education,\" and the way in which the \"rights or privileges\" of this statute were affected with reference to education, it was that they were affected in relation to denominational schools. It was only because they alleged that their \"rights or privileges in relation to denominational schools\" were affected, that they said our rights \"in relation to education\" are affected. There was no other way in which they were assumed to be affected, so that I say there can be no distinction.\nThen, was any right or privilege affected? Let us see what principle the judgment of the judicial committee lays down. The submission is, and the reason suggested to the court why those questions should be answered in the negative, and why no right of appeal exists, is, because there is no such statute existing as is defined in the clause giving the right of appeal. They can only appeal from a statute having a certain effect. The judicial committee of the Privy Council, as I submit, has decided that the statute from which they desire to appeal has not that effect. If it has not then of course there is no right of appeal.\nThe Judicial Committee says:\u2014\"Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools\" (page 147). Then they cite the words of the appeal section \"affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\"\nThen, at the foot of page 147 the court says:\u2014\"Their lordships are convinced that it must have been the intention of the legislature to preserve every legal right or privilege and every benefit or advantage in the nature of a right or privilege, with respect to denominational schools, which any class of persons practically enjoyed at the time of the union.\"\nThose words are strong, in this sense, that they define the kind of \"right and privilege\" which in their view the statute applied to, and intended to preserve. This statute they say was intended \"to preserve every legal right or privilege, and every benefit or advantage in the nature of a right or privilege, with respect to denominational schools, which any class of persons practically enjoyed at the time of the union.\" And they say this statute does not infringe upon any legal right or privilege, with respect to denominational schools, which any class of persons practically enjoyed at the time of the union. That means \"by practice,\" or practically, enjoyed at the time of the union.\nThen, if that is the true construction of the statute, as laid down by the judicial committee of the Privy Council, they have decided that this is a statute which has not the effect of interfering with any such right or privilege.\nNow, I am coming to the question: If it is not so restrained, does it make any difference, because the statute of 1871 established a system of denominational schools, as the Judicial Committee said? The statute of 1890 swept away that system; but, they go on to ask, and to define, what are the rights and privileges which the existence of that system involved, what are the immunities which it involved? First, they say there is no dispute as to the state of things which existed in Manitoba at the time of the union, and they describe it of course accurately, citing from the description of it by the archbishop. Then they say, even if that state of things which was described as existing in practice, had been established by law, what would have been the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholics with respect to denominational schools? They would have had, by law, the right to establish schools at their own expense, and so they have still, to maintain their schools by school fees, or voluntary contributions, and to conduct them in accordance with their own religion. \"Every other religious body which was engaged in a similar work at the time of the union would have had precisely the same right with respect to their denominational schools,\" I understood the Judicial Committee to say. So they have still. Possibly this right, if it had been defined or recognized by positive enactment, might have attached to it, as a necessary or appropriate incident, the right of exemption from any contribution under any circumstances to schools of a different denomination. But, in their lordships' opinion, it would be going much too far to hold that the establishment of a national system of education upon a non-sectarian basis is so inconsistent with the right to set up and maintain denominational schools that the two things cannot exist together, or that the existence of one necessarily implies or involves immunity from taxation for the purpose of the other.\nI have read this judgment many times with the greatest possible care, because, I thought every thing turned upon it. If I understand rightly, it lays down in the broadest terms this principle, that the establishment of a national non-sectarian system of education, and the obligation of all persons, indifferently of every creed and denomination, to contribute to it, is in no way inconsistent with their rights with regard to denominational schools, nor with their rights, as I submit is the inference, in relation to education, because the only complaint is, that this is an infringement of their rights in relation to denominational schools. But the Judicial Committee have said it is not. How to meet that is the insuperable difficulty produced by that judgment.\nThen they go on to say that no child is compelled to attend a public school. They say \"but what right or privilege is violated or prejudicially affected by the law?\"\nThen, going to the other point, which my learned friend has called my attention to, of course if we are right in the contention that this only touches rights which existed at the union, why, there is an end of the matter, because these rights did not exist at the union. The act of 1871, and the subsequent acts under which my learned friend says they had certain rights in relation to education, and of which they were deprived by the legislation of 1890, has no application if my first contention is right. If that contention is not right, and by the appeal clause in the Manitoba Act, just as by the appeal clause in the other act, any rights which are called into existence by the legislature of Manitoba after the union cannot be interfered with or affected by the same legislature, then my learned friend points out, and points out truly, as I understand it, that this is the state of affairs, and these were the kind of rights they had, as is correctly described in the judgment of the Judicial Committee. They had a system of separate schools, or denominational schools, whichever you choose to call them, established, by which the Roman Catholics supported their own schools, and the Protestants supported their schools, nor could a Catholic be taxed for a protestant school. None of those privileges were interfered with. But, my learned friend says they had certain rights given to them by law by which they were entitled to assess their own people for the support of their own schools, and to participate in a certain legislative grant out of the general funds of the province. So far as I can understand my learned friend is perfectly right in that, and the result of establishing a system of national schools by the act of 1890 is to sweep that away. That seems beyond all question. That is the fact, as I understand it, and therefore, the question is: Is that a right or privilege in relation to education? As I understand it now, if the Roman Catholics or Protestants choose to support a school of their own for their own people, the law gives them no power of assessment, the law does not assist them in doing it, it must be voluntary. And whatever right they had to any portion of the legislative grant to a denominational school, qua denominational school, they no longer get under the present act, because the present act establishes a national unsectarian system, and it simply says to everyone, you must all contribute to that. As to your denominational schools do just as you please, go to our schools or not, just as you like, and your children or not, as you please, we impose no disability on you because you do not take advantage of our schools; what we say is, that all people alike must contribute to this system of national education, all in the same degree and with equality; beyond that we do not interfere with you. Then, we submit that the judgment of the Privy Council says, in substance and in principle, that there is no right or privilege interfered with by this legislation. They had all these statutes before them, though I am quite free to admit, and your lordships will understand me always to admit, that they had nothing to deal with but the rights or privileges with regard to denominational schools.\nFrom the position I occupy, having no special interest to insist upon, and no special interest of any client to advance, I do not think I would be justified in taking up more of the time of the court. I have done what seemed to be the desire of the court, given such assistance as I could by pointing out the considerations which seemed to me to indicate the reason why these different questions should be answered, not as my learned friend contends, but in the opposite sense.\nI think that is all that occurs to me to say: First, that the rights and privileges which must be affected are only rights and privileges existing at the time of the union. That if they have other rights and privileges given by the legislature of Manitoba that legislature has a right to deal with them as they please. They created them, they can destroy them; and, as a matter of fact, in the result, there is no statute here affecting any right or privilege with regard to education which would form the subject matter of an appeal.\nI said I should read the different questions and suggest the answers which the court should give, but on reflection I hardly think that is worth while, because, if I am right, your lordships will see, from the result, exactly how those questions must inevitably be answered. If I am wrong, and my learned friend is right, they must be answered in the affirmative.\nEwart Q. C. in reply.\u2014I shall refer very shortly to the points put forward by Mr. Robinson. First, upon the point that if there is this right of appeal from the legislature that it is something incongruous, something inconsistent with our whole system. I answered that to some extent before. I may perhaps add now, as his argument has led to this, that there is clearly a prohibition with reference to all the provinces which had a separate school system prior to the union. Those separate school systems existed by virtue of their own statutes, passed prior to the union. My learned friend says: Is it possible that a province which passes a statute has not power to repeal it? And I say yes, and I think my learned friend will have to agree with me, that in cases where there were rights and privileges prior to the union, by virtue of the province's own statute, they have not the power.\nThen, if they are prohibited from repealing a statute passed prior to the union, why not prohibit them from repealing one they passed subsequent to the union? There is, after all, not an absolute prohibition, but it is this, that they shall not repeal it so as to prejudicially affect people to whom they had given rights, and who had vested rights, as it were, grown up under the statutes which they themselves had passed.\nWe have something of the same sort in another part of our constitution, under the disallowance provision, and it was exercised in the case of McLaren v. Caldwell[8]. It was because Ontario interfered with vested rights. There is a provision for the maintenance of vested rights.\nMy learned friend has referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Barrett v. Winnipeg[9], as being a complete answer to my position here. I think it is not, and for two reasons. He says that the Privy Council decided that it was only in respect of denominational schools, or contribution to denominational schools, that we could by any possibility object, that we could never object to subscriptions to national schools. Now, if that be so, in the Province of Quebec there is no guarantee for the protestants, although we have always assumed that there is a very carefully prepared clause guarding the protestants in Quebec. We all know that in the Province of Quebec there is not the national system, but there is the denominational system, the protestant and the catholic system. If my learned friend is right, why, the Province of Quebec to-morrow can pass an act establishing what it may choose to call what the Manitoba Act chooses to call these schools, national schools, and abolish all the protestant schools, and require the protestants to subscribe to the national schools.\nIf the principle in Barrett v. Winnipeg (2) were applied, not to the section to which they apply it, but to the subsequent section, then that would be the effect of it, and that is what my learned friend desires your lordship to do, to take the principle applied by their lord- ships in Barrett v. Winnipeg[10] in one section and apply it to the other section. I think that would be unfortunate, because it would lead, in Quebec, to what I have said.\nThen, the other reason is this, that even if that principle be applied to this section, still, that is only one of the points in which we are hurt.\nOur principal grievance to-day is that we are without organization. We had organization under these statutes, we had a right to tax ourselves, we had a right to conduct our own schools under Govemmental inspection and direction, we had to work up to a secular standard, and we are perfectly willing to do that and did do that, practically to the satisfaction of Manitoba, and what we are deprived of really is our organization. If we had that organization we would not care very much about the subscription to their national schools, because there are not any where we are. That does not apply to the cities where there would be national schools and where there would be our schools. There, we would be supporting our own, and we might have to support national schools too, but it does not apply to the great majority of cases. I mention that, not that your lordships may take it that the great majority of the schools are in that position, because your lordships have not that fact before you, but to emphasize this, that it is the deprivation of our organization that has hurt us specially, or that possibly may hurt us. One can easily see how it can hurt us. There are some matters of fact which appear in the petition which will go far to uphold what I have said.\nI ask your lordships to refer amongst all the statutes that have been mentioned and those that have been printed and put before your lordships to the statute of 1885 particularly, which will show what our powers were, what moneys we got, and what powers of assessment we had, and where the revenue came from. THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This case has been referred to the court for its opinion by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, pursuant to the provisions of \"An Act respecting the Supreme and Exchequer Courts,\" Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 135 as amended by 54 & 55 Victoria, ch. 25, sec. 4.\nSix questions are propounded which are as follows:\n(1.) Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions (referring to certain petitions and memorials presented to the Governor General in Council) and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 33 Vic. (1870) chapter 3, Canada?\n(2.) Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to or either of them?\n(3.) Does the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the cases of Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[11], dispose of or conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union under the statutes of the province, have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890 complained of in the said petitions and memorials?\n(4.) Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, apply to Manitoba?\n(5.) Has His Excellency the Governor General in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises?\n(6.) Did the Acts of Manitoba passed prior to the session of 1890 confer on or continue to the minority 'a right or privilege in relation to education' within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act or establish a system of 'separate or dissentient schools' within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, if said section 93 be found to be applicable to Manitoba; and if so, did the two Acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council? To put it in a concise form, the questions which we are called upon to answer are whether an appeal lies to the Governor General in Council either under the British North America Act, 1867, or under the Dominion Act establishing the Province of Manitoba, against an act or acts of the Legislature of Manitoba passed in 1890, whereby certain acts or parts of acts of the same legislature, previously passed, which had conferred certain rights on the Roman Catholic minority in Manitoba in respect of separate or denominational schools, were repealed.\nThe matter was brought before the court by the Solicitor General, on behalf of the crown, but was not argued by him. On behalf of the petitioners and memorialists who had sought the intervention of the Governor General, Mr. Ewart Q.C. appeared. Mr. Wade Q.C. appeared as counsel on behalf of the Province of Manitoba when the matter first came on, but declined to argue the case, and the court then, in exercise of the powers conferred by 54 & 55 Vic., chapter 25, section 4, (substituted for the Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 135, section 37,) requested Mr. Christopher Robinson Q.C., the senior member of the bar practising before this court, to argue the case in the interest of the Province of Manitoba, and on a subsequent day the matter was fully and ably argued by Mr. Ewart and Mr. Robinson.\nThe proper answers to be given to the questions propounded depend principally on the meaning to be attached to the words \"any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education\" in subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act. Do these words include rights and privileges in relation to education which did not exist at the union, but (in the words of section 93, subsection 3 of the British North America Act) have been \"thereafter established by the legislature of the province,\" or is this right or privilege mentioned in subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act the same right or privilege which is previously referred to in subsection 1 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, viz.: one, which any class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union or a right or privilege other than one which the legislature of Manitoba itself created?\nSection 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, is as follows:\u2014\nIn and for each Province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education subject and according to the following provisions.\nSubsec. 1 of the same section is as follows\nNothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with reference to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law in the Province at the Union.\nAnd subsec. 3 is in these words:\u2014\nWhere in any province a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law at the union or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or decision of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nSection 22 of the Manitoba Act is as follows: \u2014\nIn and for the Province the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education subject and according to the following provisions:\n(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the Province at the Union.\n(2) An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or decision of the legislature of the Province or of any Provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Cathotic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nIt is important to contrast these two clauses of the acts in question, inasmuch as there is intrinsic evidence in the later act that it was generally modelled on the Imperial statute, the original Confederation Act; and the divergence in the language of the two statutes is therefore significant of an intention to make some change as regards Manitoba by the provisions of the later act.\nIt will be observed that the British North America Act, section 93, subsection 3, contains the words \"or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province,\" which words are entirely omitted in the corresponding section (section 22, subsection 2) of the Manitoba Act. Again, the same subsection of the Manitoba Act gives a right of appeal to the Governor General in Council from the legislature of the province, as well as from any provincial authority, whilst by the British North America Act the right of appeal to the Governor General is only to be from the act or decision, of a provincial authority. I can refer this difference of expression in the two acts to nothing but to a deliberate intention to make some change in the operation of the respective clauses. I do not see why there should have been any departure in the Manitoba Act from the language of the British North America Act unless it was intended that the meaning should be different. On the one hand, it may well be urged that there was no reason why the provinces admitted to confederation should have been treated differently; why a different rule should prevail as regards Manitoba from that which, by express words, applied to the other provinces. On the other hand there is, it seems to me, much force in the consideration, that whilst it was reasonable that the organic law should preserve vested rights existing at the union from spoliation or interference, yet every presumption must be made in favour of the constitutional right of a legislative body to repeal the laws which it has itself enacted. No doubt this right may be controlled by a written constitution which confers legislative powers, and which may restrict those powers and make them subject to any condition which the constituent legislators may think fit to impose. A notable instance of this is, as my brother King has pointed out, afforded by the constitution of the United States, according to the construction which the Supreme Court in the well known \"Dartmouth College case\" put upon the provision prohibiting the state legislatures from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. It was there held, with a result which has been found most inconvenient, that a legislature which had created a private corporation could not repeal its own enactment granting the franchise, the reason assigned being that the grant of the franchise of a corporation was a contract. This has in practice been got over by inserting in such acts an express reservation of the right of the legislature to repeal its own act. But, as it is a prim\u00e2 facie presumption that every legislative enactment is subject to repeal by the same body which enacts it, every statute may be said to contain an implied provision that it may be revoked by the authority which has passed it, unless the right of repeal is taken away by the fundamental law, the over-riding constitution which has created the legislature itself. The point is a new one, but having regard to the strength and universality of the presumption that every legislative body has power to repeal its own laws, and that this power is almost indispensable to the useful exercise of legislative authority since a great deal of legislation is of necessity tentative and experimental, would it be arbitrary or unreasonable, or altogether unsupported by analogy, to hold as a canon of constitutional construction that such an inherent right to repeal its own acts cannot be deemed to be withheld from a legislative body having its origin in a written constitution, unless the constitution itself, by express words, takes away the right. I am of opinion that in construing the Manitoba Act we ought to proceed upon this principle and hold the legislature of that province to have absolute powers over its own legislation, untrammelled by any appeal to federal authority, unless we find some restriction of its rights in this respect in express terms in the constitutional act.\nThen, keeping the rule of construction just adverted to in view, is there anything in the terms of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act by which the right of appeal is enlarged and an appeal from the legislature is expressly added to that from any provincial authority, whilst in the British North America Act, section 93, subsection 3, the appeal is confined to one from a provincial authority only, which expressly or necessarily implies that it was the intention of those who framed the constitution of Manitoba to impose upon its legislature any disability to exercise the ordinary powers of a legislature to repeal its own enactments? I cannot see that it does, and I will endeavour to demonstrate the correctness of this opinion.\nIt might well have been considered by the Parliament of the Dominion in passing the Manitoba Act that the words \"any provincial authority\" did not include the legislature. Then, assuming it to have been intended to conserve all vested rights\u2014\"rights or privileges existing by law or practice at the time of the union,\"\u2014and to exclude or subject to federal control even legislative interference with such pre-existent rights or privileges, this prohibition or control would be provided for by making any act or decision of the legislature so interfering the subject of appeal to the Governor General in Council. If, however, the words of section 93, subsection 3, \"or is thereafter established by the legislature\" had been repeated in section 22, the legislature would have been in express and unequivocal terms restrained from repealing laws of the kind in question which they had themselves enacted except upon the conditions of a right to appeal to the Governor General. If it was intended not to do this but only to restrain the legislature of Manitoba from interfering with \"rights and privileges\" of the kind in question existing at the union, this end would have been attained by just omitting altogether from the clause the words \"or shall have been thereafter established by the legislature of the province.\" This was done.\nNext, it is clear that in interpreting the Manitoba Act the words \"any provincial authority\" do not include the legislature, for that expression is there used as an alternative to the \"legislature of the province.\"\nIt is not to be presumed that Manitoba was intended to be admitted to the union upon any different terms from the other provinces or with rights of any greater or lesser degree than the other provinces. Some difference may have been inevitable owing to the difference in the pre-existing conditions of the several provinces. It would be reasonable to attribute any difference in the terms of union and in the rights of the province to this and as far as possible by interpretation to confine any variation in legislative powers and other matters to such requirements as were rendered necessary by the circumstances and condition of Manitoba at the time of the union.\nNow let us see what would be the effect of the construction which I have suggested of both acts\u2014the British North America Act, section 93, and the Manitoba Act, section 22, in their practical application to the different provinces as regards the right of provincial legislatures to interfere with separate or denominational schools to the prejudice of a Roman Catholic or Protestant minority.\nFirst then let us consider the cases of Ontario and Quebec, the two provinces which had by law denominational schools at the union. In these provinces any law passed by a provincial legislature impairing any right or privilege in respect of such denominational schools would, by force of the prohibition contained in subsection one of section 93 of the British North America Act, be ultra vires of the legislature and of no constitutional validity.\nShould the legislatures of these provinces (Ontario and Quebec) after confederation have conferred increased rights or privileges in relation to education or minorities, I see nothing to hinder them from repealing such acts to the extent of doing away with the additional rights and privileges so conferred by their own legislation without being subject to any condition of appeal to federal authority.\nWhat is meant by the term \"provincial authority\"? The Parliament of the Dominion, as shewn by the Manitoba Act, hold that it does not include the legislature, for in subsection 2 of section 22 they use it as an alternative expression and so expressly distinguish it from the legislature. It is true the British North America Act did not emanate from the Dominion Parliament, but nevertheless the construction which that Parliament has put on the British North America Act if not binding on judicial interpreters is at least entitled to the highest respect and consideration. Secondly, the words \"provincial authority\" are not apt words to describe the legislature, and in order that a provincial legislature should be subjected to an appeal, when it merely attempts to recall its own acts, the terms used should be apt, clear and unambiguous. To return then to the cases of Ontario and Quebec, should any \"provincial authority,\" not including in these words the legislature but interpreting the expression as restricted to administrative authorities (without at present going so far as to say it included courts of justice), by any act or decision affect any right or privilege whether derived under a law or practice existing at the time of confederation or conferred by a provincial statute since the union, still remaining unrepealed and in force, that would be subject to an appeal to the Governor General.\nSecondly. As regards the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, those provinces not having had any denominational schools at the time of the union, there is nothing in their case for subsection one of section 93 to operate upon. Should either of these provinces by after-confederation legislation create rights and privileges in favour of Protestant or Catholic minorities in relation to education, then so long as these statutes remained unrepealed and in force an appeal would lie to the Governor General from any act or decision of a provincial administrative authority affecting any of such rights or privileges of a minority, but there would be nothing to prevent the legislatures of the provinces now under consideration from repealing any law which they had themselves enacted conferring such rights and privileges, nor would any act so repealing their own enactments be subject to appeal to the Governor General in Council.\nThirdly. We have the case of the Province of Manitoba; here applying the construction before mentioned the provincial powers in relation to education would be not further restricted but somewhat enlarged in comparison with those of the other provinces. Acting upon the presumption that in the absence of express words in the act of the Dominion Parliament, which embodies the constitution of the province, withholding from the legislature of the province the normal right of altering or repealing its own acts, we must hold that it was not the intention of Parliament so to limit the legislature by the organic law of the province. What, then, is the result of the legislation of the Dominion as regards Manitoba? What effect is to be given to section 22 of the Manitoba Act? By the first subsection any law of the province prejudicing any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools in the province existing at the union is ultra vires and void. This clause was the subject and the only subject, of interpretation in Barrett v. Winnipeg[12] and the point there decided was that there was no such right or privilege as was claimed in that case existing at the time of the admission of the province into the union. Had any such right or privilege been found to exist there is nothing in the judgment of the Privy Council against the inference that legislation impairing it would have been unconstitutional and void. That decision has, in my opinion, but a very remote application to the present case. The second subsection of section 22 of the Manitoba Act is as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the legislature of the province or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nI put aside as entirely irrelevant here the question whether it was or was not intended by this subsection 2 to confer on the Privy Council of the Dominion appellate jurisdiction from the provincial judiciary, a question the decision of which, I may say in passing, might well be influenced by the consideration that the power given to Parliament by the British North America Act to create federal courts had not at the time of the passage of the Manitoba act been exercised. The first subject of appeal is then, any act or decision of the legislature of the province affecting any right or privilege of the minority in respect of the matters in question. Now if we are to hold, as I am of opinion we must hold, that it was not the intention of Parliament by these words so to circumscribe the legislative rights conferred by them on Manitoba as to incapacitate that legislature from absolutely, and without any subjection to federal control, repealing its own enactments and thus taking away rights which it had itself conferred, the right of appeal to the Governor General against legislative acts must be limited to a particular class of such acts, viz.: to such as might prejudice rights and privileges not conferred by the legislature itself, but rights and privileges which could only have arisen before confederation, being those described in the first subsection of section 22. That we must assume in the absence of express words that it was not the intention of Parliament to impose upon the Manitoba legislature a disability so anomalous as an incapacity to repeal its own enactments, except subject to an appeal to the Governor General in Council and possibly the intervention of the Dominion Parliament as a paramount legislature, is a proposition I have before stated.\nTherefore, the right of appeal to the Governor General in Council must be confined to acts of the legislature affecting such rights and privileges as are mentioned in the first subsection, viz.: those existing at the union when belonging to a minority, either Protestant or Catholic. Then there would also be the right of appeal from any provincial authority. I will assume that the description \"provincial authority\" does not apply to the courts of justice. Then these words \"provincial authority\" could not, as used in this subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, have been intended to include the provincial legislature, for it is expressly distinguished from it being mentioned alternatively with the legislature. \"An appeal shall lie from any act or decision of the legislature or of any \"provincial authority,\" is the language of the section. It must then apply to the provincial executive or administrative authorities. No doubt an appeal would lie from their acts or decisions, upon the ground that some right or privilege existing at the date of the admission of the province to the federal union was thereby prejudiced. In this respect Manitoba would be in the same position as Ontario and Quebec. Unlike the cases of those provinces, and also unlike the case of the two maritime provinces, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, there would not, however, in the case of Manitoba, be an appeal to the Governor General in Council from the act or decision of any \"provincial authority,\" upon the ground that some right or privilege not existent at the time of union, but conferred subsequently by legislation, had been violated. This construction must necessarily result from the right of appeal against acts or decisions of provincial authorities, and against acts or decisions of the legislature, being limited to such as prejudiced the same class of rights or privileges. The wording of this subsection 2 shows clearly that only one class of rights or privileges could have been meant, and that the right of appeal was therefore to arise upon an invasion of these, either by the legislature or by a provincial authority. Then, as the impossibility of holding that it could have been intended to impose fetters on the legislature and to incapacitate it from absolutely repealing its own acts, requires us to limit the appeal against its enactments to acts affecting rights and privileges existing at the union, it must follow that the right of appeal must be in like manner limited as regards acts or decisions of provincial authorities. This, however, although it makes a difference between Manitoba and the other provinces, is not a very material one. The provincial authorities would of course be under the control of the courts; they could therefore be compelled, by the exercise of judicial authority, to conform themselves to the law. Much greater would have been the difference between Manitoba and the other provinces if we were to hold that whilst, as regards the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, their legislatures could enact a separate school law one session and repeal it the next, without having their repealing legislation called in question by appeal, and whilst, as regards Ontario and Quebec, although rights and privileges existing at confederation were made intangible by their legislatures, yet any increase or addition to such rights and privileges which these legislatures might grant could be withdrawn by them at their own pleasure, subject to no federal revision, yet that the legislation of Manitoba, on the same subject, should be only revocable subject to the revisory power of the Governor General in Council.\nI have thus endeavoured to show that the construction I adopt has the effect of placing all the provinces virtually in the same position, with an immaterial exception in favour of Manitoba, and it is for the purpose of demonstrating this that I have referred to appeals from the acts and decisions of provincial authorities, which are not otherwise in question in the case before us.\nThat the words \"any provincial authority\" in the third subsection of section 93 of the British North America Act do not include the legislature is a conclusion which I have reached not without difficulty. In interpreting the Manitoba Act, however, what we have to do is to ascertain in what sense the Dominion Parliament in adopting the same expression in the Manitoba Act understood it to have been used in the British North America Act.\nThat they understood these words not to include the provincial legislatures is apparent from section 22, subsection 2 of the Manitoba Act, wherein the two expressions \"provincial authority\" and \"legislature of the province\" are used in the alternative, thus indicating that in the intendment of Parliament they meant different subjects of appeal.\nAgain, why were the words contained in the third subsection of section 93 of the British North America Act \"or is thereafter established by the Legislature of the Province\" omitted, when that section was in other respects transcribed in the Manitoba Act. The reason it appears to me is plain. So long as these words stood with the context they had in the British North America Act they did not in any way tie the hands of the provincial legislatures as regards the undoing, alteration or amendment of their own work, for the words \"any provincial authority\" did not include the legislature. But when in the Manitoba Act the Dominion Parliament thought it advisable for the better protection of vested rights\u2014\"rights and privileges\" existing at the union\u2014to give a right of appeal from the legislature to the Governor General in Council, it omitted the words \"or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province,\" with the intent to avoid placing the provincial legislature under any disability or subjecting it to any appeal as regards the repeal of its own legislation, which would have been the effect if the third subsection of section 93 of the British North America Act had been literally re-enacted in the Manitoba Act with the words \"of the legislature of the province\" interpolated as we now find them in subsection 2 of the latter act. This seems to me to show conclusively that the words \"rights or privileges\" in subsection 2 of section 22 were not intended to include rights and privileges originating under provincial legislation since the union, and that the legislature of Manitoba is not debarred from exercising the common legislative right of abrogating laws which it has itself passed relating to denominational or separate schools or educational privileges, nor is such repealing legislation made subject to any appeal to the Governor General in Council.\nIn my opinion all the questions propounded for our opinion must be answered in the negative.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014By the statute 33 Vic. ch. 3, sec. 2 (D), the Manitoba Act, the provisions of the British North America Act, except so far as the same may be varied by the said act, are made applicable to the province of Manitoba, in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the several provinces of Canada, and as if the province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces united by the British North America Act. This act was imperialized, so to speak, by 34 Vic. ch. 38 (Imp.) which declares that 32 & 33 Vic. ch. 3 (D) shall be deemed to have been valid and effectual for all purposes whatsoever.\nIf we are now called upon to construe certain provisions of this statute, it seems to me that the same considerations will apply as if the provisions appeared in the British North America Act itself under the heading \"Manitoba,\" and therefore as stated by the late Chief Justice of this court, Sir W. Richards, in the case of Severn v. The Queen[13], \"in deciding important questions arising under the act passed by the Imperial Parliament for federally uniting the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, we must consider the circumstances under which that statute was passed, the condition of the different provinces, their relations to one another, as well as the system of government which prevailed in those provinces and countries.\" For convenience therefore, I will place in paralle columns the sections of the Manitoba Act and the corresponding sections of the British North America Act in relation to education, upon which we are required to give an answer.\nBritish. North America Act. Sec. 93.\nIn and for the province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1). Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law in the province at the union.\n(2). All powers, privileges and duties at the union by law conferred and imposed by Upper Canada on the separate schools and school trustees of the Queen's Roman Catholic subjects shall be and the and the same are hereby extended to the dissentient schools of the Queen's Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec.\n(3). Where in any province a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law at the union, or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nManitoba Act. Sec. 22.\nIn and for the province the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1).

In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor General in Council on any appeal under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of this section, and of any decision of the Governor General in Council under this section.\nWhat was the existing state of things in the territory then being formed into the province of Manitoba? Rebellion, as I have already stated in the case of Barrett v. Winnipeg[14] had thrown the people into a strong and fierce agitation, inflamed religious and national passions, and caused the greatest disorder, which rendered necessary the intervention of the Federal Government; and as matters then stood on the 2nd March, 1870, the government of Assiniboia, in order to pacify the inhabitants, appointed the Rev. Mr. Ritchot and Messrs. Black and Scott as joint delegates to confer with the Government of Ottawa, and negotiate the terms and conditions upon which the inhabitants of Assiniboia would consent to enter confederation with the Provinces of Canada.\nMr. Ritchot was instructed to immediately leave with Messrs. Black and Scott for Ottawa, in view of opening negotiations on the subjects of their mission with the Government at Ottawa.\nWhen they arrived at Ottawa the three delegates, Messrs. Ritchot, Black and Scott, received on the 25th April, 1870, from the Hon. Mr. Howe, the then Secretary of State for the Dominion of Canada, a letter informing them that the Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir George Cartier had been authorized by the Government of Canada to confer with them on the subject of their mission, and that they were ready to meet them.\nThe Rev. Mr. Ritchot was the bearer of the conditions upon which they were authorized to consent for the inhabitants of Assiniboia to enter confederation as a separate province.\nThese facts appear in exhibit L, Sessional Papers of Canada, 1893, 33 D., and in exhibit N of the same Sessional Paper, we see that the following conditions, arts. 5 and 7, read as follows:\u2014\n\"(5.) That all properties, all rights and privileges possessed be respected, and the establishing and settlement of the customs, usages and privileges be left for the sole decision of the local legislature.\"\n\"(7.) That the schools shall be separate, and that the moneys for schools shall be divided between the several denominations pro rat\u00e2 of their respective populations.\"\nNow, after negotiations had been going on, and despatches and instructions from the Imperial Government to the Government of Canada on the subject of the entrance of the province of Manitoba into the confederation had been received, the Manitoba Constitutional Act was prepared, and section 22 inserted as a satisfactory guarantee for their rights and privileges in relation to matters of education, as claimed by the above articles 5 and 7. And until 1890 the inhabitants of the province of Manitoba enjoyed these rights and privileges under the authority of this section and local statutes passed in conformity therewith.\nHowever, it seems by the decision of the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the case of Barrett v. Winnipeg[15] that the delegates of the North-west and the Parliament of Canada, although believing that the inhabitants of Assiniboia had before the union \"by law or by practice,\" certain rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools\u2014for the words used in subsection 1 of this section 32 are, \"which any class have by law or practice in the province at the union\"\u2014had in point of fact no such right or privilege by law or practice with respect to denominational schools, and therefore that subsection 1 is, so to speak, wiped out of the Manitoba Constitutional Act, having nothing to operate upon.\nBut if the parties agreeing to these terms of union, were in error in supposing they had by law or practice prior to the union certain rights or privileges, they certainly were not in error in trusting that the provincial legislature, (as the legislature of Quebec did after the union for the Protestant minority) which was being created would forthwith settle and establish their usages and privileges and secure by law and in accordance with Arts. 5 & 7 of the bill of rights separate schools for the Catholics of Manitoba and would make provisions so that the moneys would be divided between the Protestant and Catholic denominations pro rat\u00e2 to their respective populations. These once established and secured by their own local legislature in accordance with the terms of the union, is not the minority perfectly within the spirit and the words of the constitutional act in contending that rights and privileges so secured by an act of the legislature are at least in the same position as rights secured to minorities in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario under section 93 of the British North America Act and that subsections 2 and 3 were inserted in the act so that they might be protected by the Governor General against any subsequent legislation, by either a Protestant or Catholic majority in after years?\nIn the present reference, being again called upon to construe this same section 22, but as if subsection 1 was repealed or wiped out by judicial authority, we must, I think, take into consideration the historical fact that the Manitoba Act of 1870 was the result of the negotiations with parties who agreed to join and form part of the confederation as if they were inhabitants of one of the provinces originally united by the British North America Act, and we must credit the Parliament of Canada with having intended that the words \"an appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the legislature of the province or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education\" (which are also the words used in the 93rd section of the British North America Act) should have some effect. The only meaning and effect I can give them is that they were intended as an additional guarantee or protection to the minority, either protestant or catholic, whichever it might happen to be, that the laws which they knew would be enacted immediately after the union by their own legislature in reference to education, would be in accordance with the terms and conditions upon which they were entering the union; this guarantee was given so as to prevent later on interference with their rights and privileges by subsequent legislation without being subject to an appeal to the Governor General in Council should such subsequent act of the legislature affect any right or privilege thus secured to the Protestant or Catholic minority by their own legislature.\nIn my opinion the words used in subsection 2: \"an appeal shall lie from any act of the legislature,\" necessarily mean an appeal from any statute which the legislature has power to pass in relation to education if at the time of the passing of such statute there exists by law any right or privilege enjoyed by the minority. There is no necessity of appealing from statutes which are ultra vires, for the assumption of any unauthorized power by any local legislature under our system of government is not remedied by appeal to the Governor General in Council but by courts of justice.\nThen, as to the words \"right or privilege\" in this subsection, they refer to some right or privilege in relation to education to be created by the legislature which was being brought into existence, and which once established, might thereafter be interfered with at the hand of a local majority so as to affect the Protestant or Catholic minority in relation to education.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the Governor General in Council has the right of entertaining an appeal by the British North America Act, as well as by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act. He has also the power of considering the application upon its merits. When the application has been considered by him upon its merits, if the local legislature refuses to execute any decision to which the Governor General in Council has arrived in the premises, the Dominion Government may then, under subsection 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, pass remedial legislation for the execution of his decision.\nIn construing, as I have done, the words of subsection 2 of the 22nd section of the Manitoba Constitutional Act, which is, as regards an appeal to the Governor General in Council, but a reproduction of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, except that the clear, unequivocal and comprehensive words, \"from any act or decision of the legislature of the province,\" are added, I am pleased to see that I am but concurring in the view expressed by Lord Carnarvon in the House of Lords on the 19th February, 1867, when speaking of this right of appeal to be granted to minorities when a local act might affect rights or privileges in matters of education, as the following extract from Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, 3rd series, Feb. 19, 1867, shows:\u2014\nLORD CARNARVON.\u2014Lastly, in the 93rd clause, which contains the exceptional provisions to which I referred, your Lordships will observe some rather complicated arrangements in reference to education. I need hardly say that this great question gives rise to nearly as much earnestness and division of opinion on that as on this side of the Atlantic. This clause has been framed after long and anxious controversy in which all parties have been represented, and on conditions to which all have given their consent. It is an understanding which, as it only concerns the local interests affected, is not one that Parliament would be willing to disturb, even if in the opinion of Parliament it were susceptible of amendment; but I am bound to add, as the expression of my own opinion, that the terms of the agreement appear to me to be equitable and judicious. For the object of the clause is to secure to the religious minority of one province the same rights and privileges and protection which the religious minority of another province may enjoy. The Roman Catholic minority of Upper Canada, the Protestant minority of the Maritime Provinces, will thus stand on a footing of entire equality. But in the event of any wrong at the hand of the local majority, the minority have a right of appeal to the Governor General in Council, and may claim the application of any remedial laws that may be necessary from the central parliament of the Confederation.\nThis being so, the next point of inquiry is whether the acts of 1890 of Manitoba affect any right or privilege secured to the Catholic minority in matters of education after the union, for we have now nothing to do with the inquiry whether the Catholic minority had at the time of the union any right by law or practice, that point, as I have already stated, having been decided adversely to their contention by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Barrett v. Winnipeg[16]. By referring to the legislation from the date of the union to 1890, it is evident that the Catholics enjoyed the immunity of being taxed for other schools than their own, the right of organization, the right of self-government in this school matter, the right of taxation of their own people, the right of sharing in Government grants for education, and many other rights under the statute of a most material kind. All these rights were swept away by the acts of 1890, as well as the properties they had acquired under these acts with their taxes and their share of the public grants for education. Could the prejudice caused by the acts of 1890 be greater than it has been? The scheme that runs through the acts of 1871 and 1881 up to 1890, as Lord Watson of the Privy Council is reported to have so concisely stated on the argument of the case of Barrett v. Winnipeg (which is printed in the sessional papers of Canada, 1893), appears to have been that \"no rate payers shall be taxed for contribution towards any school except one of his own denomination,\" and I will add that this scheme is clearly pointed out in Arts. 5 and 7 of the conditions of union above already referred to, which were the basis of the constitutional act.\nNow is this a legal right or privilege enjoyed by a class of persons? In this case the immunity from contributing to any schools other than one of its own denomination was acquired by the Catholic minority qu\u00e2 Catholics by statute and Catholics certainly, at the time the legislation was passed, represented a class of persons comprising at least one-third of the inhabitants of the Province of Manitoba. It is unnecessary, I think, after reading the able judgments delivered in the case of Barrett v. Winnipeg[17] to show by authority that the right so acquired by the Catholic minority after the union by the act of 1871 was a legal right, and that if it is shown by subsequent legislation enacted by the legislature of the Province of Manitoba that there has been any interference with such right, then I am of the opinion that such interference would come within the very words of this section 22 of the Manitoba Constitutional Act, which gives a right of appeal to the Govemor General in Council from \"any act of the legislature\" (words which are not in section 93 of the British North America Act, but are in subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act), affecting a right acquired by the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nThe only other question submitted to us I need refer to is the 4th question. Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, apply to Manitoba? The answer to this question is to be found in the second section of the Manitoba Act (33 Vic.) which says \"from and after the said date the provisions of the British North America Act shall apply, except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment, may be held to be, specially applicable to, or only to affect one or more, but not the whole of the Provinces now comprising the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this act, and be applicable to the Province of Manitoba, in the same way, and to the like extent as they apply to the several provinces of Canada, and as if the Province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\" The Manitoba Act has not varied the British North America Act though subsection 2 of section 22 has a somewhat more comprehensive wording than the subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, in relation to appeal in educational matters. A statute does not vary or alter if it merely makes further provision, it is simply an addition to it. The 2nd subsection is wider but does not vary at all from the 3rd subsection of section 93 of the British North America Act, save in this that there is an addition to it, that it includes it, and goes beyond it by adding the words \"and from any act of the legislature.\" The 3rd subsection of the British North America Act provides that in two cases there is to be an appeal. There is nothing inconsistent in the Manitoba Act which says that in all cases there shall be an appeal, it goes beyond the British North America Act, it does not Vary it, but leaves it as it is and adds to it.\nWe see by the opinion expressed by some of the Lords of the Privy Council, how far the right of appeal extends under section 2 of the Manitoba Act, for in the argument on that question before the Privy Council, Sessional Papers, No. 33a, 33b, 1893, we read, at p. 134, that when Mr. Earn (counsel) was arguing on behalf of Mr. Logan in the case of Winnipeg v. Logan he said:\u2014\nI venture to think that under subsection 2 what was contemplated was this: that apart from any question, ultra vires or not, if a minority said, \"I am oppressed,\" that was the party who had to come under that section 3 and appeal to the Government.\nLord Hannen added:\u2014\nIt has a right to appeal against any act of the legislature.\nAnd Lord Shand:\u2014\nEven intra vires.\nThis being also my opinion, I will only add that, having already stated that I think that we should read the Manitoba Constitutional Act in the light of the British North America Act, and that it was intended, as regards all civil rights in educational matters, to place the province of Manitoba on the same footing as the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and that subsection 1 of section 22 having been enacted for the purpose of protecting rights held by law or practice prior to the union, but which have been declared not to exist, I am of the opinion that subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Constitutional Act provides for an appeal to the Governor General in Council, by memorial or otherwise, on the part of the Roman Catholic minority contending that the two acts of the legislative assembly of Manitoba, passed in 1890, on the subject of education, are subversive of the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic ratepayers not to be taxed for contribution towards schools, except those of their own denomination, and that such right has been acquired by statute subsequent to the union.\nFor the above reasons, I answer the questions submitted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, as follows:\u2014\n(1.) Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions, and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 33 Vic. (1870) chapter 3, Canada?\u2014Yes.\n(2.) Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to, or either of them?\u2014Yes.\n(3.) Does the decision of the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the cases of Barrett v. The City of Winnipeg, and Logan v. The City of Winnipeg, dispose of or conclude the application for redress, based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority, which accrued to them after the union, under the statutes of the province, have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained of in the said petitions and memorials?\u2014No.\n(4.) Does subsection 3 of section 93, of the British North America Act, .1867, apply to Manitoba?\u2014Yes.\n(5.) Has His Excellency the Governor General in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions, assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises?\u2014Yes.\n(6.) Did the Acts of Manitoba, relating to education, passed prior to the session of 1890, confer on or continue to the minority a \"right or privilege in relation to education\" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, \"or establish a system of separate or dissentient schools\" within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, if said section 93 be found applicable to Manitoba, and if so, did the two acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council?\u2014Yes.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I doubt our jurisdiction on this reference or consultation. Is section 4 of 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 which purports to authorize such a reference to this court for hearing \"or\" consideration intra vires of Parliament? By which section of the British North America Act is Parliament empowered to confer on this statutory court any other jurisdiction than that of a court of appeal under section 101 thereof? This court is evidently made, in the matter, a court of first instance, or rather, I should say, an advisory board of the federal executive, substituted, pro h\u00e2c vice, for the law officers of the crown, and not performing any of the usual functions of a court of appeal, nay, of any court of justice whatever. However, I need not, at present, further investigate this point. It has not been raised, and a similar enactment to the same import has already been acted upon. That is not conclusive, it is true: but our answers to the questions submitted will bind no one, not even those who put them, nay, not even those who give them, no court of justice, not even this court. We give no judgment, we determine nothing, we end no controversy; and, whatever our answers may be, should it be deemed expedient, at any time, by the Manitoba executive to impugn the constitutionality of any measure that might hereafter be taken by the federal authorities against the provincial legislation, whether such measure is in accordance with or in opposition to the answers to this consultation, the recourse, in the usual way, to the courts of the country remains open to them. That is, I presume, the consideration, and a very legitimate one, I should say, upon which the Manitoba executive acted by refraining to take part in the argument on the reference, a course that I would not have been surprised to see followed by the petitioners, unless indeed they are assured of the interference of the federal authorities should it eventually result from this reference that, constitutionally, the power to interfere with the provincial legislation as prayed for exists. For if, as a matter of policy, in the public interest, no action is to be taken upon the petitioners' application, even if the appeal lies, the futility of these proceedings is apparent.\nAssuming, then, that we have jurisdiction, I will try to give, as concisely as possible, the reasons upon which I have based my answers to the questions submitted.\nIn the view I take of the application made to His Excellency the Governor General in Council by the Catholics of Manitoba, I think it better to intervert the order of the questions put to us, and to answer first the fourth of these questions, that is, whether subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act applies to Manitoba. To that question the answer. in my opinion, must be in the negative. That section of the British North America Act applies to every one of the provinces of the Dominion, with the exception however of Manitoba, for the reason that, for Manitoba, in its special charter, the subject is specifically provided for by section 22 thereof. The maxims lex posterior derogat priori, and specialia generalibus derogant have both here, it seems to me, their application. If it had been intended to purely and simply extend the operation of that section 93 of the British North America Act to Manitoba, section 22 of its charter would not have been enacted. The course since pursued for British Columbia and Prince Edward Island would have been followed. But where we see a different course pursued we have to assume that the difference in the law was intended. I cannot see any other reason for it, and none has been suggested. True it is that the words \"or practice\" in subsection 1, of section 22, are an addition in the Manitoba charter which the Dominion Parliament desired to specially make to the analogous provision of the British North America Act, but that was no reason to word subsection 2 thereof so differently as it is from subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act. Then this difference may be easily explained though its consequences may not have been foreseen; I speak cautiously and mindful that I am not here allowed to controvert or even doubt any thing that has been said on the subject by the Privy Council. It is evident, to my mind, that it was simply because it was assumed by the Dominion Parliament, that separate or denominational schools had previously been, in that region, and were then, at the union, the basis and principle of the educational system, and with the intention of adapting such system to the new province, or rather of continuing it as found to exist, that, in the Union Act of 1870, the words of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act: \"where in any province a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law, at the union, or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province,\" were stricken out as unnecessary and inapplicable to the new province. And I do not understand that the Privy Council denies to the petitioners their right to separate schools.\nHowever, the reason of this difference between the constitution of the province and the British North America Act cannot, in my view of the question, bring much assistance in the present investigation: the fact remains, whatever may have been the reason for it, that no appeal is given to the minority, in Manitoba, in relation to the rights and privileges conceded to them since the union as distinguished from those in existence at the union. They have no rights but what is left to them by the judgment in the Barrett case; and, if I do not misunderstand that judgment, the appeal they now lay claim to is not, as a logical inference, thereby left to them.\nAnd in vain now, to support their appeal, would they urge that the statute so construed is unreasonable, unjust, inconsistent and contrary to the intentions of the law giver; uselessly would they contend that to force them to contribute pecuniarily to the maintenance of the public, non-catholic schools is to so shackle the exercise of their rights as to render them illusory and fruitless, or that to tax, not only the property of each and every one of them individually but even their school buildings for the support of the public schools is almost ironical; uselessly would they demonstrate the utter impossibility for them to efficaciously provide for the organization, maintenance and management of separate schools, and the essential requirements of a separate school system without statutory powers and the necessary legal machinery; ineffectively would they argue that to concede their right to separate schools, and withal, deprive them of the means to exercise that right, is virtually to abolish it, or to leave them nothing of it but a barren theory. With all these, and kindred considerations, we, here, in answering this consultation, are not concerned. The law has authoritatively been declared to be so, and with its consequences, we have nothing to do. Dura lex, sed lex. Judex non constituitur ad leges reformandas. Non licet judicibus de legibus judicare, sed secundum ipsas. The Manitoba legislation is constitutional, therefore it has not affected any of the rights or privileges of the minority, therefore the minority has no appeal to the federal authority. The Manitoba legislature had the right and power to pass that legislation; therefore any interference with that legislation by the federal authority would be ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nBy an express provision of the British North America Act of 1871, it must not be lost sight of, the Dominion Parliament has not the power to, in any way, alter the Manitoba Union Act of 1870.\nFor these reasons I would answer negatively the fourth of the questions submitted, and say that, in my opinion, sub-section 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act does not apply to Manitoba.\nI take up now the first of these questions: Does the right of appeal claimed by the petitioners exist under section 22 of the Manitoba Act? And here again, in my opinion, the answer must be in the negative, for the reason that it is conclusively determined, by the judgment of the Privy Council, that the Manitoba legislation does not prejudicially affect any right or privilege that the Catholics had by law or practice at the union, and if their rights and privileges are not affected there is no appeal. The rights or privileges mentioned in sub-section 2 of section 22 are the same rights and privileges that are mentioned in subsection 1, that is to say, those existing at the union, upon which subsection 3 provides for the interference, in certain cases, of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, and it is as to such rights or privileges only that an appeal is given. The appeal given, in the other provinces, by section 93 of the British North America Act as to the rights or privileges conferred on a minority after the union, is, as I have remarked, left out of the Manitoba constitution. Assuming, however, that the Manitoba constitution is wide enough to cover an appeal, by the minority, upon the infringement of any of their rights or privileges created since the union, or assuming that section 93 of the British North America Act, subsection 3, applies to Manitoba, I would be inclined to think that, by the ratio decidendi of the Privy Council, there are no rights or privileges of the Catholic minority that are infringed by the Manitoba legislation so as to allow of the exercise of the powers of the Governor in Council in the matter, as the Manitoba statutes must now be taken not to prejudicially affect any right or privilege whatever enjoyed by the Catholic community. It would seem, no doubt, by the language of both section 93 of the British North America Act and of section 22 of the Manitoba charter, that there may be provincial legislation which, though intra vires, yet might affect the rights or privileges the minority so as to give them the right to appeal to the Governor in Council. For it cannot be of ultra vires legislation that an appeal is given. And the petitioners properly disclaiming any intention to base their application on the unconstitutionality of the Manitoba statutes, even for infringement of rights conferred upon them since the union, urge that though the Privy Council has determined that the legislation in question does not affect the rights existing at the union so as to render it ultra vires yet that it does affect the rights conferred upon them by the provincial legislature since the union, so as to give them, though intra vires, an appeal to the Governor in Council. I fail to see, however, how this ingenious distinction, for which I am free to admit both the British North America Act and the Manitoba special charter give room, can help the petitioners. I assume here that the petitioners have an appeal upon rights or privileges conferred upon them since the union, as contra-distinguished from the rights previously in existence. The case is precisely the same as if the present appeal was as to their rights existing at the union. They might argue that though the Privy Council has held this legislation to have been intra vires yet their right to appeal subsists, and, in fact, exists because it is intra vires. But what would be this ground of appeal? Because the legislation affects the rights and privileges they had at the union. And the answer would be one fatal to their appeal, as it was to their contentions in the Barrett case, that none of these rights and privileges have been illegally affected. Now, the rights and privileges they lay claim to under the provincial legislation anterior to 1890 are, with the additions rendered necessary by the political organization of the country to enable them to exercise these rights, the same, in principle, that they had by practice at and before the union, and which were held by the Privy Council not to be illegally affected by the legislation of 1890.\nAnd I am unable to see how, on the one hand, this legislation might be said to affect those rights so as to support an appeal and, on the other hand, not to affect the same rights so as to render it ultra vires. The petitioners, it seems to me, would virtually renew their impeachment of the constitutionality of the Manitoba legislation of 1890 upon another ground than the one taken in the Barrett case, namely, upon the rights conferred upon them since the union, whilst the controversy in the Barrett case was limited to their rights as they existed at the union. But that legislation, as I have said, is irrevocably held to have been intra vires, and it is not open to the petitioners to argue the contrary even upon a new ground. And if it is intra vires, it cannot be that it has illegally affected any of the rights or privileges of the Catholic minority though it may be prejudicial to such right. And if it has not illegally affected any of those rights or privileges they have no appeal to the Governor in Council.\nIt has been earnestly urged, on the part of the petitioners, in their attempt to distinguish the two cases, that in the Barrett case it was only their liability to assessment for the public schools that was in issue, and, consequently, that the decision of the Privy Council, binding though it be, does not preclude them from now taking, on appeal from the provincial legislation of 1890, the ground that this legislation sweeps away the statutory powers conceded to them under the previous statutes, and without which their establishment and administration of a separate school system is impracticable. But here again, it must necessarily be on the ground that their rights and privileges, or some of their rights and privileges, have been prejudicially affected that they have to rest their case, and from that ground they are irrevocably ousted by the judgment of the Privy Council, where not only the assessment clauses thereof, more directly in issue, but each and every one of the enactments of the statute impugned, were, as I read that judgment, held to have been and to be intra vires. Were it otherwise, and could the question be treated as res integra, it might have been possible for the petitioners to establish that they are entitled to the appeal claimed on that ground, namely, that the statutes of 1890, by taking away the rights and privileges of a corporate body vested with the powers essential to the organization and maintenance of a school system that had been granted to them by the previous statutes, are subversive of those rights and privileges and prejudicially affect them.\nThey might cogently urge, in support of that proposition, and might, perhaps, have succeeded in convincing me, that to take away a right, to cancel a grant, to repeal the grant of a right, to revoke a privilege, prejudicially affects that grant, prejudicially, injuriously affects that privilege. They might also perhaps have been able to convince me that the license to own real estate, the authorization to issue debentures, to levy assessments, the powers of a corporation, that had been granted to them, constituted for them rights and privileges.\nAnd to the objection that no appeal lies under section 22 of the Manitoba charter but upon rights existing at the union they might perhaps have successfully answered, either that section 93 of the British North America Act extends to Manitoba, or, if not, that the legislation of Manitoba in the matter, since the union, prior to 1890, should be construed as declaratory of their right to separate schools, or a legislative admission of it, a legislation required merely to secure to them the means whereby to exercise that right, and that, consequently, their appeal relates back to a right existing at the union, so as to bring it, if necessary, under the terms of section 22 of the Manitoba Union Act.\nHowever, from these reasons the petitioners are now precluded. If any of their rights and privileges had been prejudicially affected this legislation would be ultr\u00e2 vires; and it is settled that it is not ultra vires.\nAnd the argument against their contention is very strong, that it being determined that it would have been in the power of the Manitoba legislature to establish, in 1871, at the outset of the political organization of the province, the system of schools that they adopted in 1890 by the statutes which the petitioners now complain of, it cannot be that by their adopting and regulating a system of separate schools, though not obliged to do so, they, forever, bound the future generations of the province to that policy, so that, as long at least as there would be even only one Roman Catholic left in the province, the legislature should be, for all time to come, deprived of the power to alter it, though the constitution vests them with the jurisdiction over education in the province. To deny to a legislative body the right to repeal its own laws, it may be said, is so to curtail its powers that an express article of its constitution must be shown to support the proposition; it is not one that can be deductively admitted.\nIf this legislation of 1890, it may be still further argued against the petitioners' contentions, had been adopted in 1871, it would, it must now be conceded, have been constitutional, and that being so, would the Catholic minority, then, in 1871, have had a right of appeal to the Governor in Council? Certainly, that is partly the same question in a different form. But it demonstrates, put in that shape, that the petitioners have now no right of appeal. The answer to their claim would then have been that they had no appeal because none of their rights and privileges had been prejudicially affected. Now, in my opinion, they have no other rights and privileges, in the construction that these words bear in the Manitoba charter, than the rights and privileges they had in 1870. And if they would have had no appeal then, on a legislation in 1871 similar to that of 1890, they have none now if none of their rights and privileges have been prejudicially affected.\nI would answer the first question in the negative. This conclusion determines my answers to the other questions submitted to the court, and, consequently, as at present advised, I would answer the six of them as follows:\u2014\nTo no. 1.\u2014Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions, and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 33 Victoria (1870), chapter 3, Canada? I would answer, no.\nTo no. 2.\u2014Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to, or either of them? I would answer, no.\nTo no. 3.\u2014Does the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the cases of Barrett v. the City of Winnipeg, and Logan v. the City of Winnipeg, dispose of or conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union under the statutes of the province have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained of in the said petitions and memorials? I would answer, yes.\nTo no. 4.\u2014Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, apply to Manitoba? I would answer, no.\nTo no. 5.\u2014Has His Excellency the Governor General in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions, assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises? I would answer, no.\nTo no. 6.\u2014Did the acts of Manitoba relating to education, passed prior to the session of 1890, confer on or continue to the minority a \"right or privilege in relation to education\" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, or establish a system of separate or dissentient schools \"within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, if said section 93, be found to be applicable to Manitoba; and if so, did the two acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the. Governor General in Council? I would answer, no.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The questions submitted in the case stated by the order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council for the opinion of this court are as follows:\u2014\nI. Is the appeal referred to in the memorials and petitions stated in and made part of the case and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22, of the Manitoba Act, 33 Vic. (1870) chapter 3, Canada?\n2. Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to or either of them?\n3. Does the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the cases of Barrett v. The City of Winnipeg and Logan v. The City of Winnipeg, dispose of or conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union under the statutes of the province have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained of in the said petitions and memorials.\n4. Does subsection 3, of section 93, of the British North America Act 1867, apply to Manitoba?\n5. Has His Excellency the Governor in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises?\n6. Did the Acts of Manitoba relating to education, passed prior to the session of 1890, confer or continue a \"right or privilege in relation to education\" within the meaning of subsection 2, of section 22, of the Manitoba Act, or establish a system of separate or dissentient schools, \"within the meaning of subsection 3, of section 93, of the British North America Act 1867, if said section be found to be applicable to Manitoba\" and if so, did the two acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council.\nThe memorials and petitions referred to in and made part of the case were presented to His Excellency the Governor General in Council in April, 1890, and in September and October, 1892; that of April, 1890, was signed by His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface and 4,266 others members of the Roman Catholic Church.\nIt alleged:\u2014\n1. That prior to the creation of the Province of Manitoba there existed in the territory now constituting that province a number of effective schools for children.\n2. That these schools were denominational schools, some of them being regulated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church and others by various Protestant denominations.\n3. That the means necessary for the support of the Roman Catholic schools were supplied to some extent by school fees paid by some of the parents of the children who attended the schools and the rest was paid out of the funds of the church contributed by its members.\n4. That during the period referred to Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of the Protestant denominations and the Protestant denominations had no interest in or control over the schools of the Roman Catholics; there were no public schools in the sense of State schools. The members of the Roman Catholic Church supported the schools of their own church for the benefit of the Roman Catholic children and were not under obligation to, and did not, contribute to the support of any other schools.\n5. That in the matter of education therefore, during the period referred to, Roman Catholics were, as a matter of custom and practice separate from the rest of the community. The petition then set forth the 22nd section of the Manitoba Act (33 Vic. ch. 3) and proceeded as follows in paragraph 7 and following paragraphs:\u2014\n7. During the first session of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba an Act was passed relating to education, the effect of which was to continue to the Roman Catholics that separate condition with reference to education which they had previous to the erection of the province.\n8. The effect of the statute so far as Roman Catholics were concerned was merely to organize the efforts which Roman Catholics had previously voluntarily made for the education of their own children. It provided for the continuance of schools under the sole control and management of Roman Catholics, and of the education of their children according to the methods by which alone they believe children should be instructed.\n9. Ever since the said legislation and until the last session of the Legislative Assembly no attempt was made to encroach upon the rights of the Roman Catholics, so confirmed to them as above mentioned, but during said session statutes were passed, 53 Vic., chaps. 37 and 38, the effect of which was to deprive the Roman Catholics altogether of their separate condition in regard tu education, to merge their schools with those of the Protestant denominations, and to require all members of the community, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to contribute through taxation to the support of what was therein called public schools, but which are in reality a continuation of the Protestant schools.\n10. There is a provision in the said act for the appointment and election of an advisory board, and also for the election in each municipality of school trustees; there is also a provision that the said advisory board may prescribe religious exercises for use in schools, and that the said school trustees may, if they think fit, direct such religious exercises to be adopted in the schools in their respective districts. No further or other provision is made with reference to religious exercises, and there is none with reference to religious training.\n11. Roman Catholics regard such schools as unfit for the purposes of education, and the children of Roman Catholic parents cannot, and will not, attend any such schools. Rather than countenance such schools Roman Catholics will revert to the ordinary system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will, at their own private expense, establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and their faith, although by so doing they will have, in addition thereto, to contribute to the expense of the so-called public schools. 12. Your petitioners submit that the said Act of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba is subversive of the rights of Roman Catholics guaranteed and confirmed to them by the statute creating the province of Manitoba, and prejudicially affects the rights and privileges with respect to Roman Catholic schools which Roman Catholics had in the province at the time of its union with the Dominion of Canada.\n13. That Roman Catholics are in minority in said province.\n14. The Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba therefore appeal from the said Act of the Legislative. Assembly of Manitoba.\nThe petitioners therefore prayed:\u2014\n1. That His Excellency the Governor General in Council may entertain the said appeal and may consider the same, and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as might be thought proper.\n2. That it might be declared that such provincial law does prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province at the union.\n3. That such directions might be given, and provisions made, for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the province as to His Excellency in Council might seem fit.\nA report of the Minister of Justice dated 21st March 1891, upon the two acts of the legislature of the province of Manitoba 53 Vic. ch. 37 and 38 has also been made part of the case submitted to us, in which reference is made to the cases of Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg then proceeding in appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and also to the said petition of His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface and others in the following terms:\u2014\nIf the appeal should be successful these acts will be annulled by judicial decision. The Roman Catholic minority of Manitoba will receive protection and redress, the acts purporting to be repealed will remain in operation and those whose views have been represented by a majority of the legislature cannot but recognize that the matter had been disposed of with due regard to the constitutional rights of the province.\nIf the controversy should result in the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (of Manitoba) being sustained the time will come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act.\nThe petitions of September 1892 were two, the one of T. A. Bernier representing himself to be acting president of the body called the National Congress and of eleven others, members of the executive committee of the said body; and the other dated the 22nd September 1892 was the petition of His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface.\nIn the former the petitioners set out at large the above petition of April 1890 and the report of the Minister of Justice from which the above extract is taken and concluded as follows:\u2014\nThat a recent decision of the judicial committee of the Privy Council in England having sustained the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba upholding the validity of the act aforesaid, your petitioners most respectfully represent that, as intimated in the said report of the Minister of Justice, the time has now come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act.\nThat your petitioners notwithstanding such decision of the judicial committee in England still believe that their rights and privileges in relation to education have been prejudicially affected by said acts of the provincial legislature.\nTherefore your petitioners most respectfully and most earnestly pray that it may please Your Excellency in Council to take into consideration the petitions above referred to and to grant the conclusions of said petitions and the relief and protection sought by the same.\nThe petition of His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface sets forth the matter as alleged in the petition signed by him and others in the petition of April 1890, and certain extracts from the said report of the Minister of Justice, of March 1891 including that above extracted, and concluded as follows:\u2014\n8. That the judicial committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council has sustained the decision of the Queen's Bench.\n9. That your petitioner believes that the time has now come for Your Excellency to consider the petitions which have been presented by and on behalf of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba for redress under subsections 2 and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act as it has become necessary that the federal power should be resorted to for the protection of the Roman Catholic minority.\nAnd the petition prayed that His Excellency the Governor General in Council might entertain the appeal of the Roman Catholics of Manitoba and might consider the same and might make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as might be thought proper and that such directions might be given and provisions made for the relief of the Roman Catholics of the province of Manitoba as to His Excellency in Council might seem fit.\nThese petitions are framed upon the contention and assumption that the facts as stated in the petitions as to the rights and privileges of Roman Catholics in Manitoba in relation to education at the time of the creation of the province entitled them to procure, by appeals to His Excellency in Council under section 22, of the Manitoba Act, the annulment and repeal of Provincial Acts 53 Vic. ch. 37 and 38, notwithstanding that these acts had been declared by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England to have been and to be acts quite within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Manitoba to enact. The petition of October, 1892, is however framed with a further contention. It is signed by His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface, T. A. Bernier as president of the body called the National Congress, James E. P. Prendergast as mayor of St. Boniface, J. Allard O. M. I., V. G., John S. Ewart and 137 others. The petition sets out verbatim the matters alleged in the first twelve paragraphs of the above petition of April, 1890, and it then proceeds:\u2014 13. Your petitioners further submit that the said acts of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba are subversive of the rights and privileges of Roman Catholics provided for by the various statutes of the said Legislative Assembly prior to the passing of the said acts and affect the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in the said province in relation to education, so provided for as aforesaid, thereby offending both against the British North America Act and the Manitoba Act.\nAnd the petition prayed as follows: \u2014\nYour petitioners therefore pray:\n1. That Your Excellency the Governor General in Council may entertain the said appeal and may consider the same and may make such provisions and give such directions for the hearing and consideration of the said appeal as may be thought proper.\n2. That it may be declared that the said acts 53 Vic. chap. 37 and 38, do prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law or practice in the province at the union.\n3. That it may be declared that the said last mentioned acts do affect the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n4. That it may be declared that to Your Excellency the Governor General in Council it seems requisite that the provisions of the statutes in force in the Province of Manitoba prior to the passage of the said acts should be re-enacted in so far at least as may be necessary to secure to the Roman Catholics in the said province the right to build, maintain, equip, manage, and conduct these schools in the manner provided for by the said statutes, to secure to them their proportionate share of any grant made out of the public funds for the purposes of education, and to relieve such members of the Roman Catholic Church as contribute to such Roman Catholic schools from all payments or contribution to the support of any other schools, or that the said acts of 1890 should be so modified or amended as to effect such purpose.\n5. And that such further or other declaration or order may be made as to Your Excellency the Governor General in Council shall, under the circumstances, seem proper, and that such directions may be given, provisions made and all things done in the premises for the purpose of affording relief to the said Roman Catholic minority in the said province, as to Your Excellency in Council may seem meet.\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray, etc.\nThe pretension of the petitioners therefore appears to be that the 22nd section of the Manitoba Act entitled the petitioners, notwithstanding the judgment of the Privy Council in England in Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[18], to invoke and to obtain the interference of His Excellency the Governor General in Council to compel, in effect, a repeal by the provincial legislature of the said acts of 53rd Vic., and the re-enactment of the statutes in force in the province in relation to education at the time of the passing of the acts 53rd Vic., upon the grounds following:\u2014\n1. That the acts of 53rd Vic. prejudicially affect the rights and privileges with regard to denominational schools which Roman Catholics had enjoyed previous to the erection of the province; and\n2. That the said acts 53rd Vic. prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of Roman Catholics in the province, provided for by various statutes of the provincial legislature enacted prior to the passing of the acts of 53rd Vic. Under these circumstances, the case which has been submitted to us has been framed in the shape in which it has been for the purpose of presenting to us purely abstract questions of law.\nThe learned members of the judicial committee of the Privy Council who advised Her Majesty upon the appeals in the cases of Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg (1) adopting the evidence of the Archbishop of St. Boniface as to the rights and privileges in relation to denominational schools enjoyed by Roman Catholics before the passing of the Manitoba Act in the territory by that act erected into the province of Manitoba, say in their report:\u2014\nNow, if the state of things which the Archbishop describes as existing before the union had been a system established by law, what would have been the rights and privileges or the Roman Catholics with respect to denominational schools? They would have had by law the right to establish schools at their own expense, to maintain their schools by school fees or voluntary contributions, and to conduct them in accordance with their own religious tenets. Every other religious body which was engaged in a similar work at the time of the union would have had precisely the same right with respect to their denominational schools. Possibly the right, if it had been defined or recognized by positive enactment, might have had attached to it, as a necessary or appropriate incident, the right of exemption from any contribution, under any circumstances, to a school of a different denomination. But in their Lordships' opinion it would be going much too far to hold that the establishment of a national system of education upon a non-sectarian basis is so inconsistent with the right to set up and maintain denominational schools, that the two things cannot exist together, or that the existence of one necessarily implies or involves immunity from taxation for the purpose of the other.\nThey then minutely review the provisions of the provincial statutes enacted prior to the passing of the acts of 1890, and of the acts of 1890 themselves, and proceed as follows:\u2014\nNotwithstanding the Public School Acts, 1890, Roman Catholics and members of every other religious body in Manitoba are free to establish schools throughout the province; they are free to maintain their schools by school fees or voluntary contributions; they are free to conduct their schools according to their own religious tenets, without molestation or interference. No child is compelled to attend a public school, no special advantage, other than the advantage of a free education in schools conducted under public management, is held out to those who do attend.\nTo this it may be added, that Roman Catholics are not excluded from the advisory board erected by the acts. They are equally eligible as Protestants to such board, and as members thereof can equally with Protestants exert their influence upon the board with regard to religious exercises in the public schools, and in short Roman Catholics and Protestants of every denomination are in every respect placed, by the acts, in precisely the same position. The judgment of the Privy Council then proceeds as follows:\u2014\nBut then it is said that it is impossible for Roman Catholics or for members of the Church of England (if their views are correctly represented by the Bishop of Rupert's Land, who has given evidence in Logan's case) to send their children to public schools where the education is not superintended and directed by the authorities of their church, and that therefore Roman Catholics and members of the Church of England who are taxed for public schools, and at the same time feel themselves compelled to support their own schools, are in a less favourable position than those who can take advantage of the free education provided by the Act of 1890; that may be so, but what right or privilege is violated or prejudicially affected by the law? It is not the law that is in fault, it is owing to religious convictions which everybody must respect, and to the teaching of their church that Roman Catholics and the members of the Church of England find themselves unable to partake of advantages which the law offers to all alike.\nThe judgment then summarily rejects the contention that the public schools created by the acts of 1890 are in reality Protestant schools and concludes in declaring and adjudging that those acts do not prejudicially affect the rights and privileges enjoyed by Roman Catholics in the territory now constituting the province of Manitoba, prior to the passing of the Manitoba Act, taking those rights and privileges to have been as represented by the Archbishop of St. Boniface, and even assuming them to have been secured or conferred by positive law, and so that they are not enacted in violation of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, but are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to enact.\nTheir Lordships of the Privy Council, in Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[19] put a construction upon this section 22 which, independently, is to my mind sufficiently apparent, but which I quote as a judicial enunciation of their Lordships' opinion. They say: \u2014\nTheir Lordships are convinced that it must have been the intention of the legislature to preserve every legal right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons practically enjoyed at the time of the union.\nThe language of the section is, I think, sufficiently clear upon that point, and all its subsections are enacted for the purpose of securing the single object, namely, the preservation of existing rights. The section enacts:\u2014\n22. In and for the province the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n1. Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the union.\n2. An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the legislature of the province or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n3. In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor General in Council, or any appeal under this section, is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then and in every such case, and as far only as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section and of any decision of the Governor General in Council under this section.\nIf any law should be passed in violation of the qualification contained in the first subsection upon the general jurisdiction conferred by the section, to make laws in relation to education, that is to say, in case any act should be passed by the provincial legislature prejudicially affecting any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union, such an act would be ultra vires of the provincial legislature to enact, and would therefore have no force; and as it was to preserve these rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools,, whatsoever they were, which existed at the time of the union, that the 22nd section was enacted. It is obvious, I think, that it is against such an act of the legislature and against any decision of any provincial authority, acting in an administrative capacity, prejudicially affecting any such right that the appeal is given by the 2nd subsection, and so likewise the remedies provided in the 3rd subsection relate to the same rights and privileges, and to the better securing the enjoyment of them. The 2nd and 3rd subsections are designed as means to redress any violation of the rights preserved by the section. To subject any act of the legislature to the appeal provided in the 2nd subsection, and to the remedies provided in the third subsection, it is obvious that such an act must be passed in violation of the condition subject to which any jurisdiction is conferred upon the provincial legislature to make laws in relation to education, and must therefore be ultra vires of the provincial legislature, for the language of the section expressly excludes from the provincial legislature all jurisdiction to pass such an act. The jurisdiction, whatever its extent may be, which the provincial legislature has over education being declared to be exclusive, there can be no appeal to any other authority against an act passed by the legislature under such jurisdiction, and any act of the legislature passed in violation of any of the provisions in section 22, subject to which the jurisdiction of the legislature is restricted, is not within their jurisdiction and is therefore ultra vires. The appeal, therefore, which is given by the 2nd subsection must be only concurrent with the right of all persons injuriously affected by such an act to raise in the ordinary courts of justice the question of its constitutionality. If any doubt could be entertained upon this point it is concluded, in my opinion, by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[20], in the following language:\nAt the commencement of the argument a doubt was suggested as to the competency of the present appeal, in consequence of the so-called appeal to the Governor in Council provided by the act, but their Lordships are satisfied that the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 do not operate to withdraw such a question as that involved in the present case from the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals of the country.\nIf an act of the provincial legislature which is impeached upon the suggestion of its prejudicially affecting such rights and privileges as aforesaid is not made by the 2nd section of the Manitoba Act ultra vires of the provincial legislature it cannot be open to appeal under subsection 2 of that section. The section does not profess to confer, upon the executive of the Dominion or the Dominion Parliament, any power of interference whatever with any act in relation to education passed by the provincial legislature of Manitoba which is not open to the objection of prejudicially affecting some right or privilege with respect to denominational schools, which some class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union; all acts of the provincial legislature not open to such objection are declared by the section to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislature; and as the acts of 1890 are declared by their Lordships not to be open to such objection, and to have therefore been within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to pass, those acts cannot, nor can either of them, be open to any appeal under the 2nd subsection of this section.\nIt has been suggested however that the rights and privileges, whether conferred or recognized by the acts of the legislature of Manitoba in force prior to and at the time of the passing of the acts of 1890 and which were thereby repealed, were within the protection of the 22nd section and that this was a matter not under consideration in Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[21]; and that therefore the right of appeal under subsection 2 of section 22 against such repeal does exist notwithstanding the decision of the Privy Council in Barrett v. Winnipeg and Logan v. Winnipeg[22]. This contention appears to have been first raised expressly in the petition presented in October 1892 although it is impliedly comprehended in the paragraphs of the petition of April 1890 which is repeated verbatim in that of October 1892, wherein the act of the provincial legislature of 1871 is relied upon as having had\u2014\nthe effect to continue to the Roman Catholics that separate condition with reference to education which they had enjoyed previous to the creation of the province, and in so far as Roman Catholics were concerned merely to organize the efforts which the Roman Catholics had previously voluntarily made for the education of their own children and for the continuance of schools under the sole control and management of Roman Catholics, and of the education of their children according to the methods by which alone they believe children should be instructed.\nBut this statute of 1871, and all the statutes passed by the legislature of Manitoba in relation to education prior to 1890, were specially brought under the notice of their Lordships of the Privy Council and were fully considered by them in their judgment as already pointed out, and if the repeal by the act of 1890 of the acts of the provincial legislature then in force in relation to education constituted a violation of the condition contained in section 22, subject to which alone the jurisdiction of the provincial legislative to make laws in relation to education was restricted, it is inconceivable to my mind that their lordships, having all these statutes before them, could have pronounced the acts of 1890 to be within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to pass. But however this may be there is nothing, in my opinion, in the Manitoba Act which imposed any obligation upon the legislature of Manitoba to pass the acts, which are repealed by the acts of 1890, or which placed those acts when passed in any different position from that of all acts of a legislature, which constitute the will of the legislature for the time being, and only until repealed,\u2014and nothing which warrants the contention that the repeal of those acts by the acts of 1890 constituted a violation of the condition in the 22nd section subject to which the jurisdiction of the legislature was restricted; and nothing, therefore, which gives any appeal against such repeal.\nWhether or not the 3rd subsection of section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867, assuming that section to apply to the Province of Manitoba, would have the effect of restraining the powers of the provincial legislature in such manner as to deprive them of jurisdiction to repeal the said acts it is unnecessary to inquire, for that section does not, in my opinion, apply to the Province of Manitoba, special provision upon the subject of education being made by the 22nd section of the Manitoba Act. For the above reasons, therefore, the questions submitted in the case must, in my opinion, be answered as follows:\u2014\nThe 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th in the negative; the 3rd in the affirmative, and the 6th, which is a complex question, as follows:\u2014\nThe acts of 1890 do not, nor does either of them, affect any right or privilege of a minority in relation to education within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act in such manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council. The residue of the question is answered by the answer to question no. 4.\nKING J.\u2014It may be convenient first to regard the constitutional provisions respecting education as they affect the original provinces of the confederation. By section 93 of the British North America Act it is provided that in and for such province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the provisions of four subsections. The first subsection provides that nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law in the province at the union.\nThe second subsection extends to the dissentient schools of the Queen's Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec all the powers, privileges and duties which were at the union conferred and imposed by law in Upper Canada (Ontario) on the separate school trustees of the Queen's Roman Catholic subjects there.\nThe third subsection gives to the Governor General in Council the right on appeal to decide whether or not an act or decision of any provincial authority affects any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority in relation to education enjoyed by them under a system of separate or dissentient schools in the province, whether such system of separate or dissentient schools shall have existed by law at the union or shall have been thereafter established by the legislature of the province.\nThe fourth subsection provides that if upon appeal the Governor General in Council shall decide that the educational right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority has been so affected, and if the provincial legislature shall not pass such laws as from time to time seem to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of the section, or if the proper provincial authority shall not duly execute the decision of the Governor General in Council on the appeal, then in every such case, but only so far as the circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section and of any decision of the Governor General in Council under the section. In other words, if the requisite remedy, either by act of the legislature or act or decision of the proper provincial authority in that behalf, is not applied then concurrent legislative authority to the requisite extent is given to the Dominion Parliament; and to this extent the legislative authority of the provincial legislature ceases to be exclusive.\nThe terms \"separate\" and \"dissentient\" schools used in the above subsections were derived from the school systems of Upper and Lower Canada. At the union the two larger confederating provinces, Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec) had each a system of separate or dissentient schools, the Canadian method of dealing with the question of religion (as between Protestants and Roman Catholics) in the public school system.\nIn Upper Canada the Roman Catholics were in the minority, and in Lower Canada the Protestants were in a still smaller minority. In Upper Canada there was a non-denominational public system, with a right in the Roman Catholics to a separate denominational system In Lower Canada the general public system was markedly Roman Catholic with a right to the Protestant minority to schools of their own. In Upper Canada the minority schools were called \"separate\" schools; in Lower Canada \"dissentient\" schools. It was because the powers and privileges of the Upper Canada minority in relation to their schools were greater than those of the Lower Canada minority that by the terms of union these were agreed to be assimilated by adopting for Quebec the more enlarged liberties of the Upper Canada law; and this was given effect to by subsection 2 of section 93 already cited.\nIn the case of the two other of the original confederating provinces, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, there was not in either a system of separate or dissentient schools.\nThe bounds of the Dominion have been since enlarged; in 1870, by the admission of the North-west Territory and Rupert's Land; in 1871, by the admission of British Columbia, and in 1872, by the admission of Prince Edward Island. In the case of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island (these being established and independent provinces) the terms of union were agreed upon by the governments and legislatures of Canada and the provinces respectively. In each case the above recited provisions of the British North America Act respecting education were adopted and made applicable without change.. In neither of these newly added provinces was there a system of separate or dissentient schools.\nWith regard to the North-west Territories and Rupert's Land there was no established government and legislature representing the people, and after the acquisition of the North-west Territories and Rupert's Land the Parliament of Canada, after listening to representations of representative bodies of people, passed an act for the creation and establishment of the new Province of Manitoba out of and over a portion of the newly acquired territory; and it is with regard to this act, (33 Vict. c. 3) that the present questions arise.\nBy section 2 it is declared that:\nThe provisions of the British North America Act shall, except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more, but not the whole, of the provinces now composing the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this Act, be applicable to the Province of Manitoba, in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the several provinces of Canada, and as if the Province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act. The act then deals specially with a number of matters, as for instance the constitution of the executive and legislative authority, the use of both the English and French languages in legislative and judicial proceedings, financial arrangements and territorial revenue, etc., and by section 22 makes the following provision respecting education:\u2014\n22. In and for the province the said legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1.) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice at the union.\n(2.) An appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the legislature of the province or of any provincial authority affecting any right of privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\n(3.) In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due execution of the provisions of this section is not made, or in case any decision of the Governor General in Council on any appeal under this section is not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that behalf, then and in every such case, and as far as the circumstances of each case require, the parliament of Canada may make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this section and of any decision of the Governor General in Council under this section.\nSubsection 1 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act differs from subsection 1 of section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867, in the addition of the words \"or practice\" after the words \"which any class of persons have by law.\"\nIn Winnipeg v. Barrett[23] the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the Manitoba Education Act of 1890 did not prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which the Roman Catholics practically enjoyed at the time of the establishment of the province. The 2nd subsection of section 93, British North America Act, has, of course, no counterpart in any of the subsections of section 22, Manitoba Act, because subsection 2, section 93, British North America Act, is a clause specially applicable to and affecting only the Province of Quebec.\nThe 3rd subsection of section 93, British North America Act, and the 2nd subsection of section 22, Manitoba Act, deal with the like subject, viz.: the right of the religious minority to appeal to the Governor-General in Council in case of their educational rights or privileges being affected; but here again there are differences.\nOne difference is, that whereas by the clause in the British North America Act the appeal lies from an \"act or decision of any provincial authority\" affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority in relation to education, in the Manitoba Act the appeal lies from \"any act or decision of the legislature of the province\" as well as from that of any provincial authority. This was either an extension of the right of appeal or the getting rid of an ambiguity, according as the words \"any provincial authority\" as used in the British North America Act did not or did extend to cover \"acts of the provincial legislature.\"\nThe addition in the 1st subsection of the Manitoba Act of the words \"or practice\" and the addition in subsection 2 of the words \"of the legislature of the province,\" would (so far as the context of these words is concerned) seem to show an intention on the part of Parliament to extend the constitutional protection accorded to minorities by the British North America Act, or at all events to make no abatement therein.\nThen there is another difference between the language of the 3rd subsection of the British North America Act and that of the 2nd subsection of the Manitoba Act. The former begins as follows: \"Where in any province a system of separate and dissentient schools exists by law at the union or is thereafter established by the legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie,\" etc., while in the Manitoba Act the introductory part is omitted, and the clause begins with the words \"an appeal shall lie,\" &c., the two clauses being thereafter identical, with the exception that in the Manitoba Act (as already mentioned) the appeal in terms extends to complaints against the effect of acts of the legislature as well as of acts or decisions of any provincial authority.\nAfter this reference to points of distinction I cite subsection 2 of the Manitoba Act again in full, for sake of clearness:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act or decision of the legislature of the province or of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to education.\nOn the one side it is contended that in order to give the appeal, the rights or privileges of the religious minority need to have been acquired and to have existed prior to and at the time of the passage of the act. On the other side it is contended that it is sufficient if the rights and privileges exist at the time of their alleged violation irrespective of the time when they were acquired.\nIn the argument before the judicial committee of Winnipeg v. Barrett, a shorthand report of which was submitted to parliament last session (No. 11 Sessional Papers), Sir Horace Davey, counsel for the city of Winnipeg, argued that subsection 2 does not relate to anything but what is ultra vires under subsection 1. He says (p. 43).\nI cannot for myself frame the proposition which would lead to the inference that subsection 2 was intended to deal with cases which were intra vires, and I beg leave to observe that it would be contrary to the whole scope and spirit of this legislation to provide for parliament intervening, not where the provincial parliament has acted beyond its powers, that I could conceive, but to allow the Dominion parliament to intervene, not to correct mistakes where the provincial legislature had gone wrong and exceeded their power.\nIn an interruption at this point by their lordships, Lord Macnaghten asks:\nSupposing some rights were created after the union, and then legislation had taken those rights away?\nThis question is not directly answered, but afterwards (p. 44) Sir Horace thus continues:\nIt all comes back to the same point, that the Protestant and Roman Catholic minority have a right to come with a grievance to the Governor General. What is that grievance? Why, that they are deprived of some right or privilege which they ought to have and are entitled to enjoy. If they are not entitled by law to enjoy it they are not deprived of anything, and it would be an extraordinary system of legislation, having regard to the nature of this act, to say that the Dominion parliament has in certain cases to sit by way of a court of appeal from the provincial parliament, not to correct mistakes where the provincial parliament has erroneously legislated on matters not within its jurisdiction, but on matters of policy. If that be the effect to be given to these subsections, I venture to submit to your lordships that it will have rather startling consequences, and it will for the first time make the legislature of the Dominion parliament a court of appeal or give them an appeal from the exercise of the discretion of the provincial parliament, or in other words, it will place the provincial parliament in the position that it will be liable to have its decisions overruled by the Dominion parliament, and therefore in a position of inferiority.\nI have quoted at great length because of the strong presentation by eminent counsel of that view, and to show that the attention of their lordships was powerfully drawn to the provisions of subsection 2. The full report shows that all the subsections of the two sections of the two acts were exhaustively discussed.\nIn the judgment their lordships say that:\nSubsections 1, 2, and 3 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, differ but slightly from the corresponding sections of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867. The only important difference is that in the Manitoba Act in subsection 1 the words \"by law\" are followed by the words \"or practice\" which do not occur in the corresponding passage in the British North America Act, 1867.\nThere would be a marked and very considerable difference between the corresponding clauses, if in the one case rights and privileges of the religious minority were recognized as subjects of protection whenever acquired, while in the other case they were not recognized as subjects of protection unless they existed at the time of the passing of the constitutional act.\nNot wanting to put undue stress upon this, let us look at the clauses for ourselves. In subsection 1, Manitoba Act, there is an express limitation as to time; the rights and privileges in denominational schools that are saved are such as existed, by law or practice, at the union. But in subsection 2 nothing is said about time at all; and the natural conclusion upon a reading of the two clauses together is that, with regard to the rights and privileges referred to in the latter clause, the time of their origin is immaterial. Such also is the ordinary and natural meaning of subsection 2, regarded by itself. Read by itself it extends to cover rights and privileges existent at the time of the act or thing complained of. The existence of the right, and not the time of its creation, is the operative and material fact. And this agrees with the corresponding provisions of the British North America Act, where subsection 1 refers to rights, etc., acquired before or at union, while subsection 3, in terms, covers rights, etc., acquired at any time. In any other view there was clearly no necessity to add the words \"or any act of the legislature\" in the remedial provision of the Manitoba Act, for such act would be wholly null and void under subsection 1. There is, indeed, an undeniable objection to treating as an appealable thing the repeal by a legislature of an act passed by itself. Ordinarily all rights and privileges given by act of Parliament are to be enjoyed sub modo, and are subject to the implied right of the same legislature to repeal or alter if it chooses to do so. But the fundamental law may make it otherwise. An illustration of this is afforded by the constitution of the United States, which prohibits the States, but not Congress, from passing any law impairing the obligation of contract, and this has been held to prevent the state legislatures from repealing or materially altering their own acts conferring private rights, when such rights have been accepted. It does not extend to acts relating to government, as, for instance, to public officers, municipal incorporations, etc., but it extends to private and other corporations, educational or otherwise, and also to acts exempting incorporated bodies, by special act) from rates or taxes. These are irrepealable, and the constitutional provision has been found onerous.\nIt is certainly anomalous, under our system and theory of parliamentary power, that a legislature may not repeal or alter in any way an act passed by itself.\nStill, weighty as this consideration is, I can give no other reasonable interpretation to the act in question than that, under the constitution of Manitoba, as under the constitution of the Dominion, the exercise by the provincial legislature of its undoubted powers in a way so as to give rights and privileges by law to the minority in respect of education, lets in the Dominion Parliament to concurrent legislative authority for the purpose of preserving and continuing such rights and privileges, if it sees fit to do so.\nBy the British North America Act it was not clear whether the words \"act or decision of any provincial authority,\" covered the case of an act of the provincial legislature, or was confined to administrative acts, but in the Manitoba Act the words explicitly extend to an act of that legislature.\nAny ambiguity in subsection 2 of the Manitoba Act is, I conceive, to be resolved in the light of the corresponding provisions of the British North America Act. As the provisions of the British North America Act are to be applicable, unless varied, I think it reasonable that ambiguous provisions in the special act should be construed in conformity with the general act.\nPassing, however, from it as a matter of construction, it does not seem reasonable that Parliament, in forming, in 1870, a constitution for Manitoba, intended to disregard entirely constitutional limitations such as were three years before established as binding upon the original members of the confederation. On the contrary, by the addition of the words \"or by practice\" in 1st subsection, and of the words \"or any act of the legislature\" in 2nd subsection, and by the provision of section 23 providing for the use of the French and English languages in the courts and legislature, there is manifested a greater tenderness for racial and denominational differences. Further, unless subsection 2 has the meaning suggested, the entire series of limitations imposed by subsections 1, 2 and 3 are entirely inoperative. For the Judicial Committee has in effect declared that no right or privilege in respect of denominational schools existed prior to the union, either by law or practice, and therefore there was nothing on which subsection 1 could practically operate; and as there was clearly no system of separate or dissentient schools established in Manitoba by law prior to the union, the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 are inoperative if the rights and privileges in relation to education are to be limited to rights and privileges before the union. There is no doubt that this construction limits the powers of the legislature and restrains the exercise of its discretion, but the same thing may be said of the effect of an appeal against \"any act or decision of any provincial authority\" in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, in case either of such provinces were to adopt a system of separate schools. The legislature might not choose to pass the remedial legislation necessary to execute the decision of the Governor General in Council, and the Dominion Parliament could then exercise its concurrent power of legislation in effect overriding the legislative determination of the provincial legislature. The provision may be weak, one-sided, as giving finality to a chance legislative vote in favour of separate schools, inconsistent with a proper autonomy, and without elements of permanence, but if it is in the constitutional system it must receive recognition in a court of law.\nAssuming then that clause 2 covers rights and privileges whensoever acquired, the next question is as to the meaning of the words \"rights and privileges of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority in relation to education?\" Here again, I think, we are to go to clause 3 of section 93, British North America Act. I think that the reference is to minority rights under a system of separate schools, and that it is essential that the complaining minority should have had rights or privileges under a system of separate or dissentient schools existing by law at the union or thereafter established by the legislature of the province. The generality of the words under clause 2 of the Manitoba Act is to be explained by clause 3, section 93, British North America Act, and to have the same meaning as the corresponding words in it.\nThe two remaining questions then, are: Was a system of separate or dissentient schools established in Manitoba prior to the passage of the Manitoba Education Act of 1890? And, have any rights or privileges of the Roman Catholic minority in relation thereto been prejudicially affected?\nOne of the learned judges of the Queen's Bench of Manitoba thus succinctly summarizes the school legislation of Manitoba in force at the time of the passing of the act of 1890:\nUnder the school acts in force in the province previous to the passing of the Public School Act of 1890, there were two distinct sets of public or common schools, the one set Protestant and the other Roman Catholic. The board of education, which had the general management of the public schools, was divided into two sections, one composed of the Protestant members and one of the Roman Catholic members, and each section had its own superintendent. The school districts were designated Protestant or Roman Catholic, as the case might be. The Protestant schools were under the immediate control of trustees elected by the Protestant ratepayers of the district, and the Catholic schools in the same way were under the control of trustees elected by the Roman Catholic ratepayers; and it was provided that the ratepayers of a district should pay the assessments that were required to supplement the legislative grant to the schools of their own denomination, and that in no case should Protestant ratepayers be obliged to pay for a Roman Catholic school, or a Catholic ratepayer for a Protestant school.\nI would only add that assessments were to be ordered by the ratepayers (Catholic or Protestant, as the case might be) of the school district, and that the trustees were empowered in many cases to collect the rates themselves, instead of making use of the public collectors. The trustees were empowered to employ teachers exclusively who should hold certificates from the section of the board of education of their own faith. By the act of 1871 the board of education was composed equally of Protestants and Roman Catholics, but by the act of 1881 the proportion was 12 Protestants to 9 Roman Catholics.\nNow, the system of education established by the act of 1881 was not in terms and eo nomine a system of separate or dissentient schools, and if the constitutional provision requires that they should be such in order to come within the act, then the minority did not have the requisite rights and privileges in respect of education. As to this, I have had doubts arising from the opinion that, where rights and privileges have no other foundation than the legislative authority whose subsequent acts in affecting them is impeached, the restraint upon the general grant of legislative authority should be applied only where the case is brought closely within the limitation. At the same time, we are to give a fair and reasonable construction to a remedial provision of the constitution, and are to regard the substance of the thing. Now the Roman Catholics were in the minority in 1881, and are still, and a system of schools was established by law, under which they had the right to their own schools\u2014Catholic in name and fact\u2014under the control of trustees selected by themselves, taught by teachers of their own faith, and supported, in part, by an assessment ordered by themselves upon the persons and property of Roman Catholics, and imposed, levied and collected as a portion of the public rates, the persons and property liable to such rate being at the same time exempt from contribution to the schools of the majority, i.e., Protestant schools. This, although not such in name, seems to me to have been essentially a system, of separate or dissentient schools, of the same general type as the separate school system of Ontario, and giving therefore to the minority rights and privileges in relation to education in the sense of subsection 2, section 22, Manitoba Act, and subsection 3, section 93, British North America Act.\nIt is true that the schools of the majority were Protestant schools, and that the majority had the same right as the minority, but I do not think that this renders the minority schools any the less essentially separate schools of the Roman Catholics. In Quebec the majority schools are distinctly denominational.\nThen, was the right and privilege of the Roman Catholic minority in this system of separate schools prejudicially affected by the act of 1890? And if so, to what extent?\nIn the judgment of the judicial committee in the City of Winnipeg v. Barrett[24], speaking of the right there claimed on behalf of the Roman Catholics that the act of 1890 had prejudicially affected the rights and privileges which they had by practice at the time of the union, their Lordships say:\u2014\nNow if the state of things which the Archbishop describes as existing before the union had been established by law, what would have been the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholics with respect to denominational schools? They would have had by law the right to establish schools at their own expense, to maintain their schools by school fees or voluntary contributions, and to conduct them in accordance with their own religious tenets. Every other religious body which was engaged in a similar work at the time of the union would have had precisely the same right with respect to their denominational schools. Possibly this right, if it had been defined or recognised by positive enactment, might have had attached to it, as a necessary or appropriate incident, the right of exemption from any contribution under any circumstances to schools of a different denomination. But, in their Lordship's opinion, it would be going much too far to hold that the establishment of a national system of education upon an unsectarian basis is so inconsistent with the right to set up and maintain denominational schools that the two things cannot exist together, or that the existence of one necessarily implies or involves immunity from taxation for the purpose of the other.\nThe rights and privileges of the denominational minority under the act of 1881 and amending acts, were different from the assumed rights in denominational schools which the same class had by practice at the time of union. It could not be said to be merely \"the right to establish schools at their own expense, to maintain their schools by school fees or voluntary contributions and to conduct them in accordance with their own religious tenets\"; it was a right as Roman Catholics by law, to establish schools and to maintain them through the exercise by them of the state power of taxation, by the imposition, levying and collecting of rates upon the persons and property of all Roman Catholics, such persons and property being at the same time exempted from liability to be rated for the support of the public schools of the majority, then denominated and being Protestant schools. By the act of 1890 the Protestant schools are abolished equally with the Roman Catholic schools, and a system of public schools set up which is neither Protestant nor Roman Catholic, but unsectarian. The question then is whether the language of their Lordships is applicable to this state of things, and whether or not it can be said (changing their Lordships' language to suit the facts) that the establishment of the national system of education upon an unsectarian basis is so inconsistent with the right to set up and maintain by the aid of public taxation upon the denominational minority, a system of denominational schools, that the two cannot co-exist; or that the existence of the system of denominational minority schools (supposing it still in existence) necessarily implies or involves immunity from taxation for the purpose of the other. It rather seems to me that no reasonable system of legislation could consistently seek to embrace these two things, viz: 1st, the support of a system of denominational schools for the minority, maintainable through compulsory rating of the persons and property of the minority; and 2nd, the support of a general system of unsectarian schools, through the compulsory rating of all persons and property, both of the majority and the minority. The effect of such a scheme would be to impose a double rate upon a part of the community for educational purposes. The logical result of this view would be that by the establishment of a general non-sectarian system (as well as by the abrogation of the separate school system) the rights and privileges as previously given by law to the denominational minority in respect of education were necessarily affected. Of course the minority would obtain equality by giving up their schools; but the present inquiry at this point is whether a right acquired by law to maintain a system of separate schools has been affected by an act which takes away the legal organization and status of such schools, and their means of maintenance, by the repeal of the law giving these things, and which subjects the persons and property of the denominational minority to an educational rate for general non-sectarian schools, instead of leaving them subjected to an educational rate for the support of the separate and denominational schools. It is true that by the act of 1881 and amending acts, the exemption was an exemption from contribution to the Protestant schools, and the schools under the act' of 1890 are not Protestant schools; but the substantial thing involved in the exemption under the acts of 1881 and amending acts was, that the ratepayer to the support of the Catholic schools should not have to pay rates for the support of the schools established by the rest of the community, but should have their educational rates appropriated solely to the support of their own schools. This was an educational right or privilege accorded to them in relation to education under a system of separate schools established by law, which the legislature, if possessing absolute or exclusive authority to legislate on the subject of education, without limitation or restraint, might very well withdraw, abrogate or materially alter, but which, under the constitutional limitations of the Manitoba Act, can be done only subject to the rights of the minority to seek the intervention of the Dominion parliament, through the exercise of the concurrent legislative authority that thereupon becomes vested in such parliament upon resort being first had to the tribunal of the Governor General in Council. Although there are points of difference between this case and what would have been the case if the prior legislation of Manitoba had established a system of separate schools following precisely the Ontario system, I cannot regard the difference as other than nominal, and I treat this case as though the act of 1881 and amending acts distinctly established a system of separate schools, giving for the general public a system of undenominational public schools, and to the Catholic minority the right to a system of separate schools. In such case I do not see how the passing of such an act as the act of 1890 could fail to be said (by abolishing the separate schools) to affect the rights and privileges of the minority in respect of education. With some change of phraseology, and some change of method, I think that what has been done in the case before us is essentially the same. If the clauses of the Manitoba Act are to have any meaning at all, they must apply to save rights and privileges which have no other foundation originally than a statute of the Manitoba legislature. The constitutional provision protects the separate educational status given by an act of the legislature to the denominational minority. The view that the effect of this is to restrain the proper exercise by the legislature of its power to alter its own legislation, is met by the opposite view that there is no improper restraint if it is a constitutional provision, and that in establishing a system of separate schools the legislature may well have borne in mind the possibly irrepealable character of its legislation in thereby creating rights and privileges in relation to education. I therefore answer the questions of the case as follows:\u2014\n1. Is the appeal referred to in the said memorials and petitions, and asserted thereby, such an appeal as is admissible by subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, or by subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, 33 Vic. (1870), chapter 3, Canada?\u2014Yes.\n2. Are the grounds set forth in the petitions and memorials such as may be the subject of appeal under the authority of the subsections above referred to, or either of them?\u2014Yes.\n3. Does the decision of the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the cases of Barrett v. The City of Winnipeg and Logan v. The City of Winnipeg, dispose of or conclude the application for redress based on the contention that the rights of the Roman Catholic minority which accrued to them after the union, under the statutes of the province, have been interfered with by the two statutes of 1890, complained of in the said petitions and memorials?\u2014No.\n4. Does subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, apply to Manitoba?\u2014Yes, to the extent as explained by the above reasons for my opinion.\n5. Has His Excellency the Governor General in Council power to make the declarations or remedial orders which are asked for in the said memorials and petitions, assuming the material facts to be as stated therein, or has His Excellency the Governor General in Council any other jurisdiction in the premises?\u2014Yes.\n6. Did the Acts of Manitoba relating to education, passed prior to the session of 1890, confer on or continue to the minority a \"right or privilege in relation to education,\" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 22 of the Manitoba Act, or establish a system of separate or dissentient schools, within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, if said section 93 be found applicable to Manitoba; and if so, did the two acts of 1890 complained of, or either of them, affect any right or privilege of the minority in such a manner that an appeal will lie thereunder to the Governor General in Council?\u2014Yes.\n[1] 1 Price 182.\n[2] 12 Mod. 486.\n[3] [1892] A.C. 445.\n[4] [2 ed., pp. 186, 198, 204, 222.]\n[5] 15 U.C.C.P. 55.\n[6] [1892] A C. 445.\n[7] 13 Can.

The act of incorporation of the City of Vancouver, 49 Vic. c. 32, sec. 213 (B.C.) vests in the city all streets, highways, &c., and in 1892 the city began the construction of works extending from the foot of Gore Avenue, with the avowed object to cross the railroad track at a level and obtain access to the harbour at deep water.\nOn an application by the Railway Company for an injunction to restrain the city corporation from proceeding with their work of construction and crossing the railway:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as the foreshore forms part of the land required by the railway company, as shown on the plan deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways, the jus publicum to get access to and from the water at the foot of Gore Avenue is subordinate to the rights given to the railroad company by the statute (44 Vic. c. 1, sec. 18 a) on the said foreshore, and therefore the injunction was properly granted.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], overruling the judgment of McCreight J. which had dissolved an injunction and dismissed the plaintiffs' action.\nThis was an action brought by the plaintiffs praying that the defendants should be ordered to remove an embankment that had been erected by them on the foreshore of Burrard Inlet, the said embankment having been erected to enable the defendants to have access to the waters of Burrard Inlet from a street of the city known as Gore Avenue, and further to restrain the defendants, their servants, agents or employees, from repeating the said offence, and that the defendants, the city, should pay damages for having erected the said embankment.\nThis action came on to be heard before His Lordship Mr. Justice McCreight, at the city of New Westminster, on the 6th and 12th days of July, 1892, and judgment was given by the said Mr. Justice McCreight on the 19th day of July, 1892, in favour of the defendants. Prom this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the full court of British Columbia, which pronounced judgment on the 12th day of December, 1892, allowing the appeal, with costs of both courts, and granting a mandatory injunction ordering that the defendants be. restrained from permitting the said embankment to remain and to remove the same, and perpetually restraining the defendants from committing any trespass upon the said portion of the foreshore of the beach of Burrard Inlet, described in the pleadings in the said action, and that the defendants pay the plaintiffs one dollar as nominal damages.\nThe material facts and pleadings are fully stated in the report of the case in the second volume of the British Columbia Reports, p. 306, and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C, and Hammersley, for the appellants.\nThe language of section 18a of the schedule A. 42 Vic. cap. 14, Stat. of Canada, does not warrant the construction the plaintiffs seek to place upon it that it grants a title in fee simple or an exclusive right to use the foreshore, but on the other hand the section, as the defendants contend, only gives a right of way or right to use the foreshore to such an extent as may be absolutely required by the Railway Company and \"in so far as the same is vested in the crown,\" that is subject always to the jus publicum of navigation and access to the water of the sea, and the proper use of the foreshore at the ends of the streets of the defendant city, otherwise it would be ultra vires.\nThe true meaning of an act of the legislature is to be found not only from the words of the act, but from the cause and necessity of its being made, from a comparison of the several parts and from extraneous circumstances. Maxwell on Statutes[2]; Walsh v. Trevanion[3]; Holliday v. Overton[4].\nWe would also call attention to the fact that where specific grants by way of aid are made to the plaintiffs in other clauses of the act provision is made for the granting of title deeds to the plaintiffs therefor, but there is no such provision here, which goes to prove that the intention of the legislature was merely to grant to the plaintiffs a right of way over the foreshore for their line of railway, not a fee simple or exclusive right.\nThe test of the plaintiffs' ownership lies in the question whether they have the right to convey or alienate any portion of the foreshore if they should so desire, and it is submitted that the said subsection 18a of their act has not granted them such property in the said lands, for on the authority of Hewlins v. Shippam[5], a freehold interest cannot be created or passed other than by deed, and there is no language in the act which can justify any interference with the jus publicum.\nBy the act of 1881 incorporating the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and authorizing the construction thereof and of which act the schedule A, clause 18, is a part under which the plaintiffs base their claim in this action, authority was only given to the company to construct their line as far as Port Moody in the province of British Columbia and not further. The company took the foreshore of Burrard Inlet as shewn by the plaintiffs under the powers of the said 18th section, but as to any portion of the line of railway authorized to be constructed by the act containing said section it is submitted that the powers contained in the 18th section must be limited, at all events, to the line of railway authorized by that act to be constructed and not to any branch line or lines that might be constructed by the company at any subsequent period and not contemplated by the legislature when the act was passed and the powers conferred.\nClause 5 of the Canadian Pacific Railway company Act, 1887, does not grant the company any further powers beyond confirming the location of the branch line from Port Moody to the City of Vancouver.\nWe also contend that the map deposited by the company under section 18 subsection A of the company's incorporation act, shewing the foreshore of Burrard Inlet as taken by the company, was deposited in 1886 and was not contemplated or sanctioned by the legislature when the said act became law.\nThe wording of the subsection A itself shows that the right granted to the Railway Company is not an exclusive right, but only to such an extent as shall be required by the company for its railways and the evidence shows that is now held by the Railway Company to the extent it is required and the user by the defendants would not interfere with the use by the Railway Company.\nMoreover the defendants by erecting the embankment in no way interfered with the using of the foreshore by the Railway Company, and the use of the foreshore over the embankment by the defendants was quite consistent with the use of the foreshore by the Railway Company under the act in the same manner as the use by the defendants of any street crossing the railway is consistent with the use by the plaintiffs of the railway crossing the street.\nIf it is held that the Dominion Government granted the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. such an exclusive right, as held by the full court of British Columbia in the judgment of the chief justice, is it such a grant as the Dominion Government could make and is it a valid exercise of legislative power consistent with the trust to the public upon which the foreshore is held by the Government?\nSee Illinois Central Railway Co. v. State of Illinois[6]; Moore's Law of Foreshore[7].\nIf the crown had intended to grant to the company the exclusive right to use the foreshore and hold it as against all other rights that might exist at common law the language of the section granting that right would have been more explicit. See judgment in Arthur v. Bokenham[8].\nThe general rule is, that in all doubtful matters and where the expression is in general terms, the words are to receive such a construction as may be agreeable to the rules of common law.\nSee Hardcastle on Statutes[9]; The Queen v. Scott[10]; The Queen v. Morris[11]; Galloway v. Mayor of London[12].\nThe rights of the public to approach and use the foreshore by the street so established is clearly sustained by the following authorities: Pion v. The North Shore Railway[13]; The Queen v. Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co.[14]; Lyon v. Fishmonger's Co.[15]; and the authorities collected and discussed in these cases.\nSee also Wood v. Esson[16]; Warin v. London & Canadian Loan Co.[17]\nThe rights of the public were vested in the appellant corporation and could be enforced by them; Fenelon Falls v.

Begbie's reasoning in the court below is unanswerable. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question in controversy in this appeal is whether or not the appellants have the right of extending a street in the city of Vancouver over a portion of the sea beach lying between the extreme limit of the said street and the Canadian Pacific Railway which has been constructed on the beach below high water mark opposite to the said street, and so of obtaining access to the waters of the harbour of Vancouver in Burrard's inlet, a portion of the sea there, which access between the said street and Burrard's inlet has been cut off by the Canadian Pacific Railway as there constructed. The appellants' contention is that the railway as constructed there is a public nuisance, and that being so the appellants, as being seized of the soil and freehold of the said street, have, in the interest of the public, a right to abate such nuisance by constructing an embankment from the terminus of the street to and over the railway and to construct a way from the other side of the railway down to the waters of Burrard's inlet and to construct a landing stage there. This contention raises two questions. 1st. Is the railway as constructed a public nuisance? And 2nd. Assuming it to be so, have the appellants the right contended for by them, and which they have asserted by proceeding to make as and for a public highway the structure necessary to provide access from the street across the railway to the sea, and so to extend the said street?\nBy sec. 17 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Act, 44 Vic. ch. 1, it is enacted that:\u2014\n17. The Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking authorized by the charter, in so far as they are not inconsistent with, or contrary to, the provisions hereof, and save and except as hereinafter provided is hereby incorporated herewith.\nAnd by sec. 18 it is among other things enacted that:\u2014\n18. As respects the said railway the seventh section of the Consolidated Railway Act 1879 relating to powers and the eighth section thereof relating to plans and surveys shall be subject to the following provisions:\u2014\na. The company shall have the right to take, use and hold the beach and land below high water mark in any stream, lake, navigable water gulf or sea in so far as the same shall be vested in the Crown, and shall not be required by the Crown, to such extent as shall be required by the company for the railway and other works and as shall be exhibited by a map or plan thereof deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways; but the provisions of this section shall not apply to any beach or land lying east of Lake Nipissing except with the approval of the Governor in Council. The object of this section plainly was, as it appears to me, to give to the company incorporated for the construction of this great public national work extending over the continent, and which for nine-tenths of the length of the proposed work was as yet wholly unsettled, much greater powers and privileges than were given to the railway companies of purely commercial character constructed under the provisions of the Railway Act of 1879, which, enlarged as it was by the provisions of 44 Vic. ch. 1, was made applicable to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nBy the Railway Act of 1879, sec. 7, subsec. 3, railway companies with whose act of incorporation the said act was incorporated were only empowered, with the consent of the Governor in Council, but not without such consent, to take, use and appropriate for the use of their railway and works so much of the public beach, or of land covered with the waters of any lake, river, stream or canal, or of their respective beds, as might be necessary for completing and using their railway, subject to certain exceptions therein contained. \u00b0And by sec. 9, subsec. 2, they were restrained from taking any greater extent of any public beach or of land covered with the waters of any lake, etc., etc., than thirty-three yards in width, except in places where the railway is raised more than five feet higher, or cut more than five feet deeper, than the surface of the line, or where offsets are established, or where stations, depots or fixtures are intended to be erected, or goods to be delivered, and there not more than two hundred and fifty yards in length by one hundred and fifty yards in breadth. Whereas, as we have seen, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are empowered, without the consent of the Governor in Council, to take, use and hold any beach or land below high water mark in any stream, lake, navigable water, gulf or sea west of Lake Nipissing, in so far as the same is vested in, and not required by, the crown, to such extent as shall be required by the company for their railway and other works, and as shall be exhibited on a map or plan thereof deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways. By these words in sec. 18 of 44 Vic., ch. 1, \"in so far as the same shall be vested in the crown, and shall not be required by the crown,\" it has been argued on behalf of the appellants that all which the statute effected was to vest in the railway company only such estate and interest in the public beach or land covered with the waters of the sea as the crown could grant to a subject, that is to say, subject to the public right of navigation on the sea, and to free access to the public from the land to the sea for that purpose, and that therefore it was incumbent upon the railway company so to construct their railway on the beach in front of the street in question as to leave free access to the public from the street to the sea; under the railway. Such a construction would make the powers conferred on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company more restricted instead of more extensive than those conferred on other railway companies by the act of 1879, which, when the consent of the Governor in Council is obtained to the companies acquiring the public property required by them, reserves no right of the public therein; moreover, such a construction would not only be more restricted than is the act of 1879, as affects the public beach, but would render the Canadian Pacific Railway act almost wholly inoperative in so far as relates to the construction of the railway upon any beach or land below high water mark in any stream, lake, navigable water, gulf or sea, for if the railway could only be so constructed as not to interfere with the free access for the public from the street in question, under the railway, to the sea it must needs be so constructed in like manner opposite all lands fronting on the beach or sea shore. The true construction, however, of the section appears to me to be that the railway company may take, use and hold to such extent as may be required by them, and as shall be exhibited on a map or plan by them deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways, any beach and any land below highwater mark in any stream, lake, navigable water, gulf or sea, west of Lake Nipissing, which is vested in and not required by the crown, the object of the section being to provide for the company's acquiring to their own absolute use so much of such lands as should be required by the company for their railway and other works as are still vested in, and not required by, the crown, excluding in this manner from the operation of the section all such land of the description stated as having been vested in the crown had been granted already by the crown, and leaving the company as to such land or land covered with water, &c, to deal with the grantees thereof, as to their property therein, under the provisions of the act as to the taking possession of, and holding to their own use, property vested in others than the crown.\nNow, in or prior to the year 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company acquired a large tract of land consisting of parts of lots nos. 181 and 196 in group no. one of the Westminster District of the Province of British Columbia, with a view of laying out a town site thereon which should form the terminus of their railway on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and in 1885 they caused the site of a town to be surveyed and laid down thereon, which they designed to call Vancouver, and upon the 30th day of November, in that year, they deposited pursuant to the provisions of a statute of British Columbia a map and plan of the said town site, in the district land Registry Office, upon which map and plan was delineated a certain street called Gore avenue, terminating on the edge of the beach or sea shore, at or above the high water mark of the Harbour of Vancouver, in Burrard's Inlet, an arm of the Pacific Ocean. Upon the 6th of April, 1886, an act was passed by the legislature of British Columbia, intituled: \"An Act to incorporate the City of Vancouver\", whereby the inhabitants of the land therein described as the City of Vancouver were incorporated as a municipal corporation. The land so described as and for the City of Vancouver included within its boundaries the land surveyed, laid out and registered by the Railway Company as the said town site. By the 213th section of the above act it is enacted that every public street, road, square, lane, bridge or other highway in the city should be vested in the city (that is in the city corporation), subject to any right in the soil which the individuals who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway should reserve, and that such road, street, bridge or highway should not be interfered with in any manner whatever by excavation or otherwise by any company or by any person whomsoever, except upon application to, and permission given by, the city engineer in writing.\nNo right was reserved by the railway company over Gore avenue or in the soil thereof or over or in any other of the streets laid down on the town site, the map and plan of which was so registered as aforesaid, and so it is contended by the appellants and not disputed by the company that the municipal corporation of the city of Vancouver are seized in fee of the soil of the said street called Gore avenue subject to the trust of using and suffering to be used and maintaining the same as and for a public street in the said city of Vancouver.\nUpon the 12th of May, 1886, the company deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways, as required by the said 18th section of their act of incorporation, a plan which showed the location of their railway as proposed to be constructed by them on the beach and foreshore of Burrard's inlet in front of the said city of Vancouver, and they subsequently constructed their railway upon the said beach and foreshore by a continuous solid embankment of about 50 feet in width at the base and about 20 feet in width on the top, which is about 12 or 14 feet in perpendicular height above the beach. Between this embankment and the extreme limit of Gore avenue there is a space of 41 feet and 6 inches. This space the company have ever since the construction of their railway there kept enclosed by a fence running along the extreme limit of Gore avenue and for some distance on either side of Gore avenue, and such space was so enclosed as part of the beach and foreshore taken and required by the company for their railway there.\nAfter the construction of their said railway in manner aforesaid and after the establishment of their terminus upon the coast of the Pacific Ocean at the said city of Vancouver, an act was passed by the Canadian Parliament on the 23rd of June, 1887, intituled \"An act further to amend the act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\" whereby, after reciting that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had by petition represented among other things:\u2014\nThat under the powers already possessed by the company it has constructed branch lines to the city of Vancouver and to the city of New Westminster, and desires to have the location thereof confirmed, and that it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition\nit was among other things enacted that:\u2014\nThe location of the branch lines of the company between Port Moody and the city of New Westminster and between Port Moody and the city of Vancouver is hereby ratified and confirmed, and the lien and charge created by the mortgage bonds of the company and by the deed of mortgage securing the same under the provisions of the act passed in the session held in the forty-eighth and forty-ninth years of Her Majesty's reign ch. 57 shall extend to and attach upon the said last mentioned branch of the company's railway.\nIt was contended for the appellants that the object of this enactment was merely to make the said branch railway subject, like the main railway, to the recited mortgage bonds and mortgage; but, granting that this may have been the motive for enacting the clause in question, it cannot be doubted that the location of the railway, so made subject to the mortgage, is expressly ratified and confirmed as constructed, so that if there had been any doubt as to the legality of the mode of construction on the beach opposite Gore Avenue such doubt is effectually removed. It is admitted that the appellants are not entitled, in virtue of their seisin of the soil of the street, to claim compensation as for lands injuriously affected by the construction of the railway; doubtless they are not. The cases of Rose v. Groves[49]; Eastern Counlies Railway Co. v. Dorling[50]; Attorney-General v. Conservators of the Thames[51]; Lyon v. Fishmongers' Co.[52]; Attorney-General of Straits Settlements v. Wemyss[53]; and North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion[54]; conclusively show such a right to be a private right of the proprietors of land abutting on tidal or navigable rivers and the sea shore, and as the corporation of the city of Vancouver only claim to be seised of the soil of the street upon trust to use it, and to permit it to be used, by the public as a street or highway, which right is unaffected by the construction of the railway on the beach, they have no private right affected which can give them any claim for compensation as for lands injuriously affected, and if they had, such claim could only be asserted in the manner provided by the statute. The corporation of the city of Vancouver, that is to say, the inhabitants of the city, have no more right to complain of their access with the sea from Gore Avenue having been cut off by the railway as constructed on the beach there, than any other member of the public desirous of having such access.\nIt was further contended for the appellants that an act of parliament could not take away a public right of access from the shore to the sea unless by suitable express words. This point was raised in Corporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[55] and was held not to be maintainable.\nIt was likewise contended that the public had a right of access from Gore Avenue across the beach to the sea; that point was also raised in the same case, where it was contended on the one side, and denied on the other, that the right of the public to get from the end of a street on to the shingle on the sea shore was a right appertaining to Her Majesty in right of her crown, and that the crown could not deprive the public of such right. The point, however, was not decided in that case, because it was agreed that another question should be first argued and determined, and it having been determined concluded the case. However, it may be here observed that in Blundell v. Catterall[56], Holroyd J. says:\u2014\nThe public common law rights with, respect to. the sea, &c., independently of usage, are rights upon the water, not upon the land, of passage and fishing on the sea, and on the sea shore when covered with water; and though, as incident thereto, the public must have the means of getting to the water for those purposes, yet it will appear that it is by and from such places only as necessity or usage have appropriated to those purposes, and not a general right of lading, unlading, landing, or embarking where they please upon the sea shore or the land adjoining thereto except in case of peril or necessity.\nAnd Abbott C. J. at p. 311, says:\u2014 As the waters of the sea are open to the use of all persons for all lawful purposes it has been contended, as a general proposition, that there must he an equally universal right of access to them for all such purposes over land like the present. If this could be established the defendant must undoubtedly prevail. But in my opinion there is no sufficient ground either in authority or in reason to support this general proposition.\nAnd then he proceeds to give his reason for his conclusion that such proposition cannot be maintained. It cannot, however, be disputed that Parliament can extinguish such right of the public, if any such existed, and that Parliament has done so in the present case cannot in my opinion admit of a doubt. But assuming the public to have the right contended for, no authority has been cited which warrants the corporation of the city of Vancouver in assuming to represent the public and to redress the public injury complained of by erecting the structure at the beach and across the railway which the corporation have proceeded to construct; the case of Fenelon Falls v. Victoria Railway Company[57] was cited for the purpose, but that was a wholly different case from the present, and is not at all an authority in support of the contention of the appellants; it was a case of wrongful acts committed by a railway company upon the soil of a street vested in the corporation, in short the common case of trespass upon the soil of the street of which the corporation were seised.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014Concurred.\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia restraining the city of Vancouver from interfering with land held by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The line of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs east and west along the foreshore in front of the city of Vancouver at or near the foot of Gore Avenue. The track is carried upon a solid embankment about 12 feet in height, and the site of it is about half way between high and low water mark.\nThe city corporation began the construction of a stone and earth embankment extending in a line from the foot of Gore Avenue across the intervening piece of foreshore to the railroad track, the outer end of such embankment resting upon the slope of the railroad embankment. The avowed object of the city corporation was to cross the railroad track at a level and obtain access to the harbour at deep water, and with this view they proposed to raise the embankment to the level of the railroad track and then continue it down the foreshore to low water mark.\nThe waters in front of Vancouver were part of Burrard Inlet, and the part directly in front was known as Coal Harbour. This harbour was accustomed to be frequented by vessels before the incorporation of the railroad company or of the city of Vancouver. Being a public harbour the foreshore vested in the Queen in right of the Dominion. Holman v. Green[58].\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated by 44 Vic. ch. 1, 1881. By section 18a it was enacted that the company should have the right to take, use and hold the beach and land below highwater mark in any stream, lake, navigable water, gulf or sea, in so far as the same shall be vested in the crown and shall not be required by the crown, to such extent as shall be required by the company for its railway and other works and as shall be exhibited by a map or plan thereof deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways. The act of incorporation provided for the construction of the line to Port Moody, B. C, as a terminus, but it also, as was held in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Major,[59] empowered the company to extend their line from Port Moody to Coal Harbour and English Bay.\nIn March, 1886, the company deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways a map or plan certified as showing the \"lands required for right of way, Burrard Inlet, B. C.\" On this was exhibited the mainland and the foreshore at the foot of Gore Avenue and for some distance east and west of it. A portion of the mainland fronting on the water, both to the east and west of Gore Avenue (but not including Gore Avenue itself), was tinted yellow on the plan, as indicating that it was vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. A tract coloured pink was shown extending along the harbour front and including all the foreshore out to deep water, but this is not now material. A red line running along and upon the foreshore indicated the centre of the railroad track. Although there is no note explanatory of it the part coloured pink evidently represents lands held by the crown, which the company proposed to take, use and hold for the purposes of its railroad and other works, and covers the land in question.\nBy 51 Vic. ch. 6 sec. 5 the location of the branch between Port Moody and Vancouver was ratified and confirmed; this, at least, went to confirm to the company the right to take, use and hold the land then in fact taken, held and used, in the sense in which subsection a of section 18 of the act of incorporation authorized a taking, using and holding.\nWhat then is the meaning of such subsection? The appellant contends that the words \"in so far as the same shall be vested in the crown\" excludes the right of interference with the jus publicum; that the crown having no right, of itself, to grant to a subject the foreshore freed from the public right of navigation there is a saving of such right. I think, however, that these words refer to the title of the crown in the lands as such. The term \"vested\" denotes title. If the lands remained in the crown and were not required by the crown the company were empowered to take them \"to such extent as shall be required by the company for its railway and other work,\" the company exhibiting the extent of their requirements by a map or plan thereof deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways and Canals. If the contention of the appellant as to this is correct the company could not build on the foreshore at all, because this would necessarily take away public rights of fishing there.\nAt the same time I think that whether or not the public right is extinguished is a matter of construction, even though it may not be intended to be saved by the clause already referred to.\nThe public right is not to be taken away to a greater extent than is rendered necessary by what the act authorizes. In Yarmouth v. Simmons[60], and Standly v. Perry[61], it was held that a public right of way may be extinguished by statute by implication if the implication is a necessary one. These were both cases of the interruption of travel from the foot of a public highway to the shore of navigable waters through the construction of a pier. In the latter case the present Chief Justice of Canada says:\u2014\nIt is argued that the act did not confer power to erect the harbour works so as to intercept the passage from the end of a public highway to the waters of the lake. The answer to this is to be found in the original statute which authorizes the selection of any site at Cobourg, without exception of streets, for works which are to be the private property of the company.\nIn the former case Fry J. says[62]:\nThe result of the construction of the pier was this, that, whereas persons had been in the habit of getting from the sea-wall at the end of Bank Street on to the shingle, there was now to be placed, on the very space through which every person so doing had to pass, a permanent structure of planks through which persons could not pass. There was a physical impossibility in persons who had exercised the alleged right continuing to exercise it in the manner in which they had previously done. The exercise of the right and the existence of the pier were absolutely inconsistent.\nThere was a clause in the General Harbours Act that nothing in the act should abrogate or prejudice any estate, right, title, interest, prerogative, royalty, jurisdiction or authority of or pertaining to Her Majesty in right of her crown. Assuming the statute to be applicable it was held that the rights referred to in that section were rights of property, or rights in the nature of property, belonging to the crown as crown property. It is true that the act authorized the pier owners to take toll from every one, but this was relied on only to rebut the contention that the act had given a substituted right of way.\nThe principle of the judgment (as also the principle of Standly v. Perry)[63] is that:\nWhere the legislature clearly and distinctly authorizes the doing of a thing which is physically inconsistent with the continuance of an existing right the right is gone, because the thing cannot be done without abrogating the right.\nAnd that is the principle that I conceive is to be applied here. The jus publicum is to be subordinated to the rights given to the railroad company by statute, so far, and only so far, as there is a physical inconsistency between the maintenance of the jus publicum and the doing of the thing which the legislature has authorized to be done. Now, what was being authorized was the construction of a line of railway with its incidental works. A line of railway upon low level (as the sea shore) is ordinarily built by solid embankment. The company was authorized to take and hold the foreshore, for the purpose of making their railway, and the natural and ordinary result of this would be to interfere with, and to some extent to extinguish, the public right of navigation. How could navigation be carried on where a line of railway was authorized to be constructed and operated? If it be said that the road might be built on trestles this would not save the right of navigation; and, besides, in a grant of power to be exercised over such great areas it is not reasonable to conclude that the company were to be bound to unusual modes of building. The contention of the appellant requires that no rod of foreshore shall be taken without the company being subject to the same obligation.\nIn saying this much I do not mean to say that the public rights of navigation are destroyed entirely. The public right of navigation involves the right to land and ship goods at places which law or usage points out for such purpose. This is a right which I think need not by necessary implication be deemed inconsistent with the rights given by statute to the railway company. It would, indeed, be wholly impracticable for the company usefully and beneficially to exercise their statutory privileges if the right of every riparian owner to get access to and from the water at his land is to be preserved. This would not be properly the exercise of public right of navigation as such, but rather something incidental to the exercise of the property right to get access to and from the property.\nBut the public right involved in the right of navigation of loading and unloading at recognized public places is a different matter, and I wish to guard against saying anything against the right of the public to protect such right even in the face of the powers given by this act. That, however, is not the right attempted to be set up here. It does not sufficiently appear, that this was a public or necessary place of lading and unlading waterborne goods or of the embarking or disembarking of persons, and of thus carrying on navigaation through or by means of it.\nFrom the evidence it would appear as though it were proposed to make a new landing for the benefit of the city of Vancouver, and not to maintain the right to an accustomed public landing place established as such before the railroad company built their line. As expressed by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, the claim of the city of Vancouver involves the equal right of every owner on the foreshore to cross the line of the railroad at will and place embankments and other structures upon the soil which the legislature has authorized the railroad company to take, use and hold for the purpose of the railroad and its works. I think also that, except in cases of necessity, the public right is to be maintained and defended and protected by the Attorney-General for the crown. Therefore I think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: A. St. G. Hamersley.\nSolicitor for respondents: R. E.

(1887) c. 109\u20149 Geo. 2 c. 36 (Imp.)\nA will which has been revoked cannot, since the passing of the Ontario Wills Act (R.S.O. [1887] c. 109) he revived by a codicil unless the intention to revive it appears on the face of the codicil either by express words referring to the will as revoked and importing such intention, or by a disposition of the testator\u2019s property inconsistent with any other intention, or by other expressions conveying to the mind of the court, with reasonable certainty, the existence of the intention in question. A reference in the codicil to a date of the revoked will, and the removal of an executor named therein and substitution of another in his place, will not revive it.\nHeld, per King J. dissenting, that a codicil referring to the revoked will by date and removing an executor named therein is sufficient indication of an intention to revive such will more especially when the several instruments are executed under circumstances showing such intention.\nHeld, per Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ., that the Imperial Statute, 9 Geo. 2 c. 36 (the Mortmain Act) is in force in the province of Ontario, the courts of that province having so held (Doe d. Anderson v. Todd, 2 U.C.Q.B. 82; Corporation of Whitby v. Liscombe 23 Gr. 1), and the legislature having recognized it as in force by excluding its operation from acts authorizing corporations to hold lands.\nHeld, per Gwynne J., that a will is not invalid because it was executed in pursuance of a solicitor\u2019s opinion on a matter of law which proved to be unsound.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming, but varying, the judgment at the trial which held the will of Patrick Purcell made in May, 1890, and revoked by another will in January, 1891, to be revived by a subsequent codicil.\nIn May, 1890, Purcell made a will by which he devised a large portion of his property to religious corporations to be used for charitable purposes. Some time afterwards he consulted a solicitor who advised him that the Imperial statute 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36, the statute of mortmain, was in force in Ontario and by reason of its provisions these bequests might fail and a great deal of his property be left undevised. After receiving this advice Purcell executed a new will disposing of his property in a different manner and after doing so he took other advice as to the statute of mortmain being in force and its effect upon the first will, which was expressly revoked by the later instrument, and in March, 1891, he executed the following codicil prepared by another solicitor who knew nothing of the will of January, 1891, or the revocation of that of May, 1890.\nI will and devise that the following be taken as a codicil to my will of the 14th day of May, 1890, A.D.:\nI hereby revoke the appointment of Jas. A. Stuart, my late bookkeeper, to be one of the executors of this my will, and in his place and stead I appoint John Bergin, of the town of Cornwall, barrister-at-law, with all the powers and duties heretofore conferred upon the said Jas. A. Stuart, as in my said will declared. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of March, 1891, A.D.\nP. PURCELL.\nSigned, sealed and published and delivered by Patrick Purcell as a codicil to his last will and testament, in the presence of us who in his presence, at his request, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto affixed our names as witnesses.\nGEORGE MILDEN,\nR. FLANNIGAN,\nNot long after executing this codicil Purcell died and proceedings were taken to have it declared that the will of May, 1890, was revived by said codicil and was the last will of the testator. The court of first instance held that it was so revived and should take effect from its date. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, that court affirmed the decision but varied it by declaring that the revived will only took effect from the date of the codicil. From that decision an appeal was taken to this court by the religious corporations affected by the decision as to the date from which the revived will would operate, such date being less than six months before the testator\u2019s death which would cause the devises to lapse under the Mortmain Act. The next of kin took a cross appeal from that part of the decision which held the will of May, 1890, revived.\nThe facts of the case are set out more fully in the judgments of Mr. Justice Gwynne and Mr. Justice Sedgewick in this court.\nThe argument proceeded as if there had been but one appeal before the court.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and Anglin for the appellants on the main appeal, the religious corporations affected by the date as to which the revived will took effect. The argument on that point is omitted as it was not dealt with by the court in giving judgment. The learned counsel then argued the question raised by the cross-appeal.\nThe codicil sufficiently indicated the intention of the testator to revive the will of May, 1890. In the Goods of Turner[2]; In the Goods of Reynolds[3]; McLeod v. McNab[4].\nA will may be revived by implication; Newton v. Newton[5]; In the Goods of Atkinson[6].\nThe statute of Mortmain is not in force in Ontario; Ray v. Annual Conference of New Brunswick[7]; In re Robson[8] The doctrine of stare decisis will not prevent this court from holding it not in force, notwithstanding the decisions of the Ontario courts to the contrary. Hart v. Frame[9]; In re Nathan[10].\nLatchford for the respondent, the St. Patrick\u2019s Orphan Asylum, and MacTavish Q.C. for the respondents, the Good Shepherd Nuns, argued that the will of May, 1890, was revived by the codicil.\nRobinson Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for the testator\u2019s next of kin, respondents in the main appeal and appellants in the cross-appeal. It cannot be well contended that the will of January, 1891. was void for having been executed on erroneous advice on matters of law. To effect such a result the error must appear on the face of the will Jarman on Wills[11]; Newton v. Newton (4); Attorney General v. Lloyd[12].\nSince the passing of The Wills Act a revoked will cannot be revived by a codicil in this form. In the Goods of Steele[13]; McLeod v. McNab (3); Marsh v. Marsh[14]. Leitch Q.C. for the executors of John Purcell one of the next of kin, referred to Dudley v. Champion[15]; Brown v. McNab[16].\nBlake Q.C. and Anglin were heard in reply.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow cross-appeal and dismiss principal appeal. I adopt Chief Justice Hagarty\u2019s view, and the reasons given by his lordship, that the will of January, 1891, is Purcell\u2019s last will, and that the will of 1890 was not revived by the codicil.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question before us is, which of two instruments, the one bearing date the 14th day of May, 1890, and the other the 10th day of January, 1891, was the true last will and testament of Patrick Purcell, deceased, and as such entitled to be admitted to probate. In determining this question the rule to be applied is, that the court should proceed upon such evidence of the surrounding circumstances as, by placing it in the position of the testator, will the better enable it to read the true sense of the words used in a codicil bearing date the 16th day of March, 1891, and to determine whether the testator has upon it shown his intention to be to revoke the instrument of January, 1891, and to revive that of May, 1890, which had been absolutely and expressly revoked by that of January, 1891; accordingly evidence of these surrounding circumstances was largely entered into and some evidence was also received by the court below which, as I think, was not admissible.\nUpon the 14th May, 1890, Patrick Purcell, since deceased, made his last will and testament in writing and thereby appointed Alexander Leclair, Angus McDonald and James Stuart the executors of the said will. To them he devised all his property, real and personal, of every nature and kind whatsoever and wherever of which he should die possessed or entitled unto upon certain trusts therein declared. It may be here said that the personalty consisted of about one-tenth in value of the realty, the whole consisting in round numbers of about $600,000. He then, in clauses numbered from 1 to 39 inclusive, made devises in favour of his family and near relations and friends. To a few only is it necessary to refer. The first three clauses contained devises in favour of his wife. By the fourth he also devised to her five thousand dollars in cash. By the tenth he devised to his niece, Catherine Forrestal, wife of Alexander Leclair, two thousand dollars, if alive at his death, and if not the same to go to her children then alive, share and share alike. By the eleventh to his niece Isabella Forrestal, five thousand dollars. By the thirteenth to his sister Bridget McDonald, two thousand dollars. By the fourteenth to Miss Ada Fisette, two thousand dollars. By the eighteenth he devised that his executors should have power, should they deem it advisable, to expend the sum of one thousand dollars in ornamenting his family burying ground at Flanagan Point, and also the sum of one thousand dollars for a monument over his grave unless he should have done so himself before his death.\nBy the twenty-first clause he devised to Emily Nash, wife of Donald A. Cameron, of the township of Charlottenburgh, for her own separate use and benefit, the mortgage money which her husband might owe the testator at the time of his death.\nBy the twenty-eighth clause he devised to his niece, Mary Forrestal, the sum of one thousand dollars. By the thirty-second clause he devised to his adopted child, A.P. Tully, the sum of two hundred dollars.\nBy the thirty-eighth clause he devised to Miss Victoria McVicar, of Port Arthur, the sum of two hundred dollars.\nHe then devised to his executors, for their travelling expenses and in lieu of all commissions for administering his estate, the sum of five hundred dollars each.\nHe then devised and directed that all the residue of all his property, of every nature and kind whatsoever, should be divided by his executors into twenty-seven parts, which they should dispose of as follows:\u2014\nBy the forty-first clause he devised and directed that six of the said twenty-seven parts of the said residue should be paid to the Roman Catholic Bishop of the diocese of Alexandria, in the province of Ontario, at the time of his death, for distribution among the deserving poor of all denominations in the county of Glengarry, and the education of boys belonging to the said county as he might decide, according to his own discretion, and not otherwise; and in the event of there being no bishop of the diocese at the time of his death, then that the said six parts should be paid to the next bishop of the said diocese appointed after his death.\nBy the forty-second clause he devised three other parts of the said residue to be paid in equal shares to the superioresses of the convents in the said county of Glengarry, to be expended by them in the education, support and clothing of poor children, and the support and clothing of indigent men and women in the said county of Glengarry.\nBy the forty-third clause he devised to the said Roman Catholic Bishop of the diocese of Alexandria four other parts of the said residue for distribution amongst the deserving poor of the town of Cornwall and county of Stormont, and for the education and clothing of boys belonging to the said town and county, as he might decide and according to his own discretion, and not otherwise; and in the event of there being no bishop of the said diocese alive at the time of his death, then that the said four parts should be paid to the next bishop of the said diocese appointed after his death.\nBy the forty-fourth clause he devised two other parts of the said residue to be paid in equal shares to the superioresses of the convents in the town of Cornwall and county of Stormont, to be expended by them in the education, support and clothing of indigent men and women in the said town of Cornwall and county of Stormont as they might respectively decide.\nBy the forty-fifth clause he devised that four other parts of the said residue should be paid to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of the archdiocese of Kingston, in the province of Ontario, at the time of his death, for distribution amongst the deserving poor of the said archdiocese, and the education and clothing of boys belonging to the said archdiocese, as he might decide according to his own discretion; and in the event of there being no archbishop of the said archdiocese alive at the time of his death, then that the said four parts should be paid to the next archbishop of the said archdiocese, to be expended as aforesaid.\nBy the forty-sixth clause he devised two other parts of the residue to be paid in equal shares amongst the superioresses of the convents in the said archdiocese of Kingston to be expended by them in the education, support and clothing of poor children and the support and clothing of indigent men and women in the said diocese as they might respectively decide.\nBy the forty-seventh clause he devised four other parts of the said residue to be paid to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of the archdiocese of Ottawa at the time of his death for distribution among the deserving poor of the said archdiocese as he might decide according to his own discretion, and in the event of there being no archbishop of the said archdiocese alive at the time of his death, then that the said four parts should be paid to the next archbishop to be appointed for the said archdiocese to be expended as aforesaid.\nBy the forty-eighth clause he devised one other part of the said residue to the trustees of St. Patrick\u2019s Orphan Asylum at Ottawa for the benefit of that institution, and he devised one other part of the said residue to be paid to the Good Shepherd Nuns of the city of Ottawa.\nHe then revoked all former wills by him theretofore made.\nUpon this will being executed the testator deposited it for safe keeping in the surrogate court in the town of Cornwall and he kept a copy of it in his own possession.\nPrior to and in the month of November, 1890, he evidently contemplated making considerable alterations in the bequests devised by the will, for he had in his own handwriting entered upon the copy retained by him certain alterations, as follows:\u2014\n1. Instead of the five thousand dollars in cash devised to his wife by clause four he inserted two thousand.\n2. Instead of the two thousand dollars devised to his niece Catherine Forrestal by clause ten he inserted one thousand.\n3. Instead of the five thousand dollars devised to his niece Isabella Forrestal by clause eleven he inserted one thousand.\n4. Instead of the two thousand dollars devised to his sister Bridget McDonald by clause thirteen he inserted one thousand. 5. He erased from clause eighteen the devise of one thousand dollars which his executors were empowered to expend in ornamenting his family burying ground at Flannigan Point.\n6. Instead of the devise to Emily Nash in the twenty-first clause of the mortgage monies which might be due to testator at the time of his death by her husband, he inserted the sum of five hundred dollars.\n7. Instead of the devise in the twenty-eighth clause to his niece Mary Forrestal of one thousand dollars he inserted five hundred.\n8. Instead of the devise of two hundred dollars to A.P. Tully in the thirty-second clause he inserted \u201chis choice of the horses;\u201d this was inserted in the handwriting of Weldon the testator\u2019s clerk by the testator\u2019s directions and was the only alteration not made in testator\u2019s own handwriting.\n9. Instead of the six of the twenty-seven parts of residue devised to the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese of Alexandria for distribution amongst the deserving poor of all denominations, he inserted the words \u201ctwo thousand for deserving poor of all denominations.\u201d\n10. Instead of the devise of three parts of said residue to the superioresses of the convents in the county of Glengarry he inserted the words one thousand. And instead of the devise of other four parts of the said residue to the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese of Alexandria he inserted the figures \u201c1,500.\u201d Here he appears by the evidence to have stopped; although crosses in red pencil are drawn across the subsequent clauses of the will it does not appear when they were so drawn.\nSometime in the month of November, 1890, the testator went into the office of Mr. D.B. Maclennan, a solicitor of thirty years, standing practising in Cornwall, and asked him if he would have any objection to act as executor under his will to which Mr. Maclennan having assented he left the office. Then we find that the testator gave to his confidential clerk the copy of the will in which he had made the alterations aforesaid, and directed him to copy it out clean as altered up to the end of the thirty-ninth clause. In the copy so handed to the clerk to copy the name of James Stuart was erased and in his stead were inserted the words D.B. Maclennan, Barrister, Cornwall; and at the end of the clauses devising five hundred dollars to each of his executors, were added the words \u201cand to D.B. Maclennan in full for his professional and law expenses $1,000 extra,\u201d and this additional clause which was not in the will of May, 1890.\n\u201cI devise to James Meagher the most southerly house and lot situate in Gladstone, East Cornwall, lately owned by D.H. McKenzie, and on his death to my adopted son A.P. Tully, absolutely forever should he be alive at the time of his death.\u201d The testator\u2019s clerk having copied out clean the copy of will as so altered, the copy so prepared up to the devise of the residence, that is to say, to the end of the thirty-ninth clause, remained in the testator\u2019s possession until the 10th day of January, 1891, when the testator having been ill for some days caused the following letter to be written by his clerk and sent to Mr. Maclennan.\n\u201cSUMMERSTOWN, JANUARY, 10, 1891.\n\u201cD.B. MACLENNAN, Esq., Cornwall.\n\u201cDEAR, SIR,\u2014I wish you to come here immediately and bring my will, now in the Probate Court in Cornwall, with you. This will be your authority for getting said instrument.\n\u201cP. PURCELL.\n\u201cWire me if they do not give you my will.\n\u201cP.P.\u201d Upon receipt of this letter Mr. Maclennan went to the Surrogate Court, got the will he was directed to get and taking it with him went to Mr. Purcell\u2019s house. He there, in Mr. Purcell\u2019s presence and at his request, opened the sealed packet in which the will was and read it. After having read it Mr. Purcell asked him what he thought of the provisions made in it for the bishops and other charitable bequests; thereupon Mr. Maclennan informed him that in his opinion the bequests would fail or prevail according to the proportion which his personal estate should bear to his lands and mortgages, and that under a will, drawn as it was, if he was correct in his opinion about the charitable bequests, a large portion of his estate would pass as undevised to his widow and next of kin. About this time the clean copy made by Mr. Purcell himself up to clause forty of the will of 1890 was produced, and Mr. Purcell asked Mr. Maclennan to write down what he wished to be done in regard to the charitable bequests in order to have the will so begun completed. Mr. Maclennan accordingly took down Mr. Purcell\u2019s instructions and therefrom made a draft will from clause forty to the last clause inclusive which is as follows:\u2014\nI direct that the bequests made in the five next preceding paragraphs of this my will be paid out of my personal estate, other than such as may be secured by mortgage on real estate, and I hereby revoke and annul all former wills made by me.\nHe thereupon procured the clauses so drafted to be added by Mr. Purcell\u2019s clerk to that which had already been written over by him up to clause forty, which being done the will so prepared was on the same 10th day of January duly executed by Mr. Purcell as and for his last will and testament. When Mr. Maclennan, in taking instructions for drafting the clauses from clause forty inclusive, had reached the end of the charitable bequests he asked the testator what he wished to do with the residue, to which he replied, \u201cI will do nothing with it.\u201d\nI have dealt at large with this evidence for the purpose of showing that this will was executed after the greatest deliberation on the part of the testator, and that the will of May, 1890, was in the most express terms revoked and annulled by it. A couple of days afterwards, viz., on the 12th January, 1891, Mr. Purcell\u2019s clerk by Mr. Purcell\u2019s direction addressed and sent to Mr. Maclennan a letter saying:\nMr. Purcell wishes you to change the bequest to Bishop Macdonell of Alexandria from ten thousand to five thousand dollars and to insert a clause that upon his demise his will shall be inserted in the leading local newspapers. You know how to act in regard to this clause.\nYours truly,\nGEORGE MELDEN,\nFor P.P.\nUpon receipt of this letter Mr. Maclennan had a new will written out with this alteration made in it and sent it enclosed addressed to Mr. Purcell. It does not however appear to have been ever executed by Mr. Purcell.\nNow here we have been asked to say, first, that the will of May, 1890, was only revoked in consequence of the advice of Mr. Maclennan (and indeed of others also) which was to the effect that the provisions of the Imperial statute, 9 Geo. 2, c. 36, were in force in Ontario; secondly, that such advice was erroneous; thirdly, that being erroneous the will of the 10th January, 1891, should be held to have been executed under mistake; and fourthly, that it should therefore be regarded as never having had any effect. For this contention there does not seem to be any foundation in law or in fact. In answer to it however, it may be said: first, the suggestion that the testator proceeded solely upon the advice given him as to the provisions of the statute of Geo. 2 being in force in Ontario, is altogether an assumption which we are not warranted in making; secondly, that the testator acted upon the belief that the advice given him was sound may be admitted, but there is no authority for holding that the advice upon which the testator proceeded turning out to be unsound would avoid the will executed upon that advice.\nThirdly, the judgment in Doe Anderson v. Todd[17], delivered in 1845, which held that the provisions of the statute of 9 Geo. 2 were in force in Upper Canada, was followed by several decisions in the courts of Upper Canada and Ontario until 1875, when Ferguson v. Gibson[18], and Whitby v. Liscombe[19], were decided. This latter case having been carried to the Court of Appeal the law as laid down in Doe Anderson v. Todd17 was there affirmed. That judgment has ever since been not only undoubtingly followed by the courts of Ontario, but may be said to have been recognized by the legislature as sound law by the insertion, in acts authorizing corporations to hold lands, of the non-obstante clause used in 3 & 4 Wm. 4 ch. 78, referred to in Doe Anderson v. Todd17, and Whitby v. Liscombe19:\u2014\nThe acts of Parliament commonly called the statutes of mortmain or other acts, laws or usages to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe act of the Ontario Legislature, 55 Vic. ch. 20, although passed after the decease of the testator, shows clearly that the provisions of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36 were regarded by the legislature as having been always in force in that province as they had been held by the courts to be. That act is entitled, \u201cAn Act to amend the law relating to mortmain and charitable uses,\u2019 and by the 8th section it is enacted that:\u2014\nMoney charged or secured on land or other personal estate arising from or in connection with land, shall not be deemed to be subject to the provisions of the statutes known as \u201cthe statutes of mortmain or charitable uses,\u201d as respects the will of a person dying after the passing of this act.\nIf, therefore, it had been relevant to the question before us, and I think it is not, to inquire whether the advice given by Mr. Maclennan was sound or not, it could not, I think, be doubted that it was quite sound.\nThen evidence was given of a conversation which his medical attendant, Dr. Bergin, had with the testator on the 12th January, 1891, and the following day, and of what Dr. Bergin had done in consequence of such conversations, under which John Bergin, Dr. Bergin\u2019s brother, came to be employed to draw the codicil of the 16th March, 1891. This evidence was tendered with the view of establishing that from the 12th or 13th January, 1891, the testator entertained the intention of appointing Mr. John Bergin, who drew the codicil, to be an executor of his will.\nAll that that evidence appears to me to show, and this it shows very clearly, is that for some reason or other the testator kept Dr. Bergin in ignorance of the fact of his having executed the will of January, 1891. Except in so far as showing the circumstances attending the preparation of the codicil by John Bergin the evidence has no bearing upon the question before us, which is, simply: Does or does not the codicil so prepared, and which was executed by the testator, show by its terms that the testator\u2019s intention was to revoke the will of January, 1891, and to revive in its place that of May, 1890? In so far as a case like the present, wherein a question arises the determination of which must be arrived at by the light of the surrounding circumstances, can be governed by a judgment in a case where a like question arises to be determined also by the light of its surrounding circumstances, I think that the judgments in the cases of In the Goods of Steele[20], and In the Goods of Turner[21], the latter being decided in 1891, are the nearest to the present case, and which we should follow.\nPlacing ourselves then in the position in which the testator was when he executed the codicil in question it is to my mind inconceivable that the testator could have contemplated by that codicil and the language used therein that he was expressing an intention to revoke the will of Jan. 7th 1891, which he had had prepared with so much deliberation, and revive in the stead that of May 1890, which with like deliberation he had expressly revoked and annulled; utterly inconceivable, if his intention had been to revoke the one and revive the other, that no words expressing such intention should have been inserted. John Bergin who drew the codicil had no knowledge of the existence of the will of January 1891, or of any will but that of May 1890. He had no instructions to prepare a codicil which should have the effect of revoking the will of Jan. 7th 1891, and of reviving that of May 1890. When he drew the codicil he believed, although erroneously, the will of May, 1890, to be in full force and effect as the testator\u2019s last will and testament and that Stuart was still one of the executors of such will. He, therefore, when preparing the codicil never intended to prepare one which should have the effect of reviving a will which he believed to be in full force and effect in law and in fact. The language which he used in the codicil is, therefore, naturally quite in accord with his belief as to then continuing and existing validity in law and in fact of the will to which he was preparing a codicil. The only thing which the language used by him in the codicil professes to do is to revoke what he believed to be an existing valid appointment then force of Stuart as one of the executors of an instru- ment then existing in full force and effect as the last will and testament of the testator, and if that belief had been well founded the codicil would have had its intended and expressed effect. The language used is: \u201cI hereby revoke the appointment of James A. Stuart,\u201d &c., to be one of the executors of this my will and in \u201chis place and stead I appoint John Bergin, &c., &c.\u201d\nNow the appointment of Stuart as an executor of that will had already been revoked and annulled by the will of January 1891, so that the codicil so worded could have no effect as it could not revoke an appointment which had already been revoked; failing to have the effect intended, namely, of revoking a valid instrument in full force and effect as the testator\u2019s will, I cannot see upon what principle the language so used, which was perfectly applicable if the will of May 1890, had then been in full force and effect as the person using the language believed it to be, can be construed as showing an intention to revoke the will of January, 1891, by which Stuart\u2019s appointment as an executor should be annulled and that of John Bergin substituted in his place; it would be necessary to construe it as first revoking the will of January 1891, which is not expressed in it and thereby of reviving in its integrity the will of 1890, including the appointment of Stuart and then revoking the appointment of Stuart as an executor of such revived will. In other words the will of May, 1890, must be revived before the codicil revoking the appointment thereof can take effect.\nIn the judgment of Sir J.P. Wilde, in In the Goods of Steele[22], he says:\u2014\nI therefore infer that the legislature meant that the intention of which it speaks should appear on the face of the codicil either by express words referring to a will as revoked and importing an intention to revive the same or by a disposition of the testator\u2019s property inconsistent with any other intention or by some other expressions convey- ing to the mind of the court with reasonable certainty the existence of the intention in question. In other words I conceive that it was designed by the statute to do away with the revival of wills by mere implication.\nAnd he refers to the judgment of Sir C. Creswell, in Marsh v. Marsh[23], wherein that learned judge expresses himself of opinion that the intention of the legislature was to put an end equally to implied revocations and implied revivals.\nPlacing myself, therefore, in view of the surrounding circumstances, as well as I can in the position of the testator when, upon the 16th March, 1891, he executed the codicil of that date, it fails by its language to convey to my mind with any degree of certainty, or indeed I may say at all, that there existed in the mind of the testator the intention of revoking thereby the will of January, 1891, which he had executed after the utmost apparent deliberation, or of reviving the will of May, 1890, which with like deliberation he had revoked and annulled by the will of January, 1891. The only intention shown by the codicil is an intention to revoke an appointment assumed to be still valid and subsisting in a will also assumed to be then in full force as the last will of the testator, and as the will to which the codicil is professed to be made a codicil and the appointment professed to be revoked had then no such existence the codicil fails to have any effect. I am of opinion, therefore, that the will of January, 1891, was not revoked thereby, and that upon the decease of the testator that instrument constituted his sole last will and as such is entitled to be admitted to probate. It would serve no useful purpose to attempt to offer any affirmative explanation of what the testator\u2019s real object in executing that codicil may have been any more than of his object in designedly, as it would seem, keeping his medical attendant, Dr. Bergin, in ignorance of the fact of his having executed the will of January, 1891.\nIt is sufficient to say that the codicil does not upon its face show an intention to revoke the will of January, 1891, and to revive that of May, 1890.\nThe appeal of the plaintiff below will be allowed and that of all the other parties disallowed and an order will go to the effect that the will of January, 1891, is alone entitled to be admitted to probate. The costs of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to be allowed to them out of the estate. The other appeals to be dismissed without costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014In this appeal there are three testamentary instruments to be considered, the will of the 14th May, 1890 (the O\u2019Gara will), the will of the 10th of January, 1891 (the Maclennan will), and the codicil of the 16th of March, 1891; and the main question is whether that codicil, purporting to be a codicil to the O\u2019Gara will, revives that will, and, as a consequence, revokes the Maclennan will. The answer to this question depends largely upon the effect that is to be given to the 24th section of the act respecting Wills[24], which is as follows:\u2014\nNo will or codicil, or any part thereof, which has been in any measure revoked, shall be revived otherwise than by the re-execution thereof or by a codicil executed in the manner hereinbefore required, and showing an intention to revive the same, etc.\nthis section being an exact transcript of the corresponding section in the Imperial Wills Act[25]. The Maclennan will had revoked the O\u2019Gara will, and the subsequent codicil is in the words following:\u2014\nI will and devise that the following be taken as a codicil to my will of the 14th day of May, 1890, A.D:\u2014\nI hereby revoke the appointment of Jas. A. Stuart, my late bookkeeper, to be one of the executors of this my will, and in his place and stead I appoint John Bergin, of the town of Cornwall, barrister-at-law, with all the powers and duties heretofore conferred upon the said Jas. A. Stuart, as in my said will declared.\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of March, 1891, A.D.\nP. PURCELL.\nSigned, sealed and published and delivered by Patrick Purcell as a codicil to his last will and testament, in the presence of us who in his presence, at his request, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto affixed our names as witnesses.\nGEORGE MILDEN,\nR. FLANNIGAN,\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal has held (Hagarty C.J. dissenting) that the effect of this codicil, read in connection with the surrounding circumstances, is to revive the revoked will to which it expressly refers, and also to revoke the Maclennan will, the revival to take effect, however, only from the date of the codicil.\nPrior to the passing of the English Wills Act, above referred to, the law was that if a testator made a codicil to a revoked will (it being perfectly clear that the codicil related to that will), the revoked will was thereby revived, and the revoking instrument thereby revoked.\nThe object of the statute was to do away with the revival of wills by mere implication, and to make it clear that in the codicil itself there must be some unequivocal expression of an intent on the testator\u2019s part to restore to life the revoked instrument.\nIt has been decided, over and over again[26], that a reference in a codicil to a revoked will, by its date only, is not of itself a sufficient indication of an intent to revive that will, and these decisions have been, in effect, approved of by the Privy Council in McLeod v. McNab[27].\nAll we have in the present case is a codicil referring to a revoked will by its date, and changing one of the three executors and trustees therein named, nothing more. And the question comes down to this: Does such a codicil, within the meaning of the statute, show an intention to revive the will to which it purports to relate? Or, in other words, does a codicil which merely changes the name of one of three executors named in a revoked will revive it?\nNow a codicil to a will whether in force or revoked must make some change in its dispositions It must do something. Leave out of the present codicil the appointment of Mr. Bergin in place of Stuart and it would be a mere piece of useless paper. The law is, as I have said, that the reference by date to the O\u2019Gara will does not, of itself, show an intention to revive it. Does the substitution of one executor for another, and nothing more, show that intention? If it does, then I can conceive of no codicil to a revoked will which would not show that intention. A codicil must make some alteration in the testament to which it relates. If that alteration, by reason of its being an alteration, shows the reviving intention then the statute is meaningless. No change in the old law has been effected by it.\nIt seems to me (I say it with deference) that in the courts below the distinction has been lost sight of between an intention to make a codicil to a revoked will and an intention to revive a revoked will. I think it probably clear from the evidence that in the present case there was an intention to make a codicil to the revoked will. The document on its face so purports. The evidence does not lead to the conclusion that the testator made a mistake as to the particular will he was dealing with, but if he intended to revive that will and to revoke the later instrument the statute required that he should say so, either in express terms, or in words that would convey to ordinary minds with reasonable certainty the existence of both intentions, the one as well as the other. The expression of the reviving intention, as distinguished from the other intention, was as necessary as the performance of any other statutory requirement; its execution in the presence of two witnesses, for example, and the absence of such expression, it seems to me, brings the codicil within the statute and prevents it from having the effect contended for.\nTo return, however, to the particular terms of the codicil. One cannot well pass judgment upon the relative importance of the different provisions which a testator may make by his will, but it seems to me that in ordinary cases the change by codicil of one of three executors named in a will is a matter of little account At law an executor takes nothing beneficially under a will. He is a mere machine. His duty, his sole duty, is to realize the estate and distribute it as by the will provided. Apart from recent statutes as executor he received no pay. He is an officer of the court only, strictly accountable for the discharge of duty but entitled to no emoluments; even if he is sole executor it is a barren honour, but when he is but one of three it amounts to less. I should say that, in ordinary cases, a bequest or devise is a matter of much more importance than the appointment to an executorship. A beneficiary gets something. And suppose that in the present case the only provision was that out of the residue of the estate one John Smith was to be paid by the executors ten shillings. Would that indicate an intention to revive the will? Observe how far reaching is the bequest. It is a recognition of the executors as named in the will. It is a direction to them to alter the original distribution of the estate. It is a taking away from the residuary beneficiaries of perhaps to them a large sum of money, and it might with equal force, it seems to me, be contended that such codicil showed upon its face an intention to revive. If that be so then any codicil must show a like intention, and the statute is words and nothing more.\nIn this view, so far, I understand that three of the four learned judges of the appeal court agree with me; but Mr. Justice Maclennan, (and with him Mr. Justice Osler,) have come to a different conclusion, having reference to \u201cthe surrounding circumstances.\u201d Let us look at these \u201ccircumstances.\u201d The O\u2019Gara will had been executed on the 14th of May, 1890, and had been deposited on file with the registrar of the Surrogate Court at Cornwall. It was a most elaborate document containing more than forty gifts and devises of different kinds, and purported to dispose of all the property of the testator, about nine tenths (speaking roughly) being set apart for what may be called charitable purposes. Out of the three executors therein named was one James Stuart. During the year 1890 the testator for some reason (not clear from the evidence) had lost confidence in Stuart, and in the month of November he called upon Mr. D.B. Maclennan, a solicitor practising in Cornwall, and one of the leading members of the Ontario bar, and obtained his consent to act as one of the executors of his will. In the mean time he (the testator) had before him a copy of the O\u2019Gara will. There was a question in his mind as to the possible legality of the charitable dispositions therein contained, the money for the purpose of satisfying them having to be raised from the proceeds of the sale of impure personalty as well as real estate, and we find that he went carefully over all the provisions of this will with his own hand, striking out this provision and changing that, with a view of executing a new will based upon his changed intentions. On the 10th of January following his man of business by his directions, and in his name, wrote to Mr. Maclennan requesting him to get the O\u2019Gara will from the court and come to him. Mr. Maclennan on the same day went to him with the O\u2019Gara will and under his instructions prepared and had executed another will substantially of the purport which the testator had in his own hand made out upon the copy of the O\u2019Gara will, previously in his possession. By this will the O\u2019Gara will was revoked. Mr. Maclennan was substituted as an executor instead of Stuart, the charitable bequests were enormously reduced and the residue was intentionally left undisposed of. It is admitted on all sides that this will was perfectly valid as a testamentary instrument, it being claimed however that having been executed as alleged under mistaken advice as to the effect of the mortmain acts (to which I will refer hereafter), the O\u2019Gara will which it purported to revoke was not in law revoked and that they both should be admitted to probate.\nThis will (the Maclennan will) was taken by the solicitor to Cornwall to be placed on file and the revoked O\u2019Gara will was left with Mr. Purcell.\nAll this happened on the 10th of January. On the following day, (the 11th), Dr. Bergin visited the testator. Dr. Bergin, who is member of Parliament for the County of Stormont and a man of eminence in his profession, had for years been Purcell\u2019s medical adviser. Purcell had likewise been in the habit of conversing with him on business matters and he (Dr. Bergin) was more or less conversant with his affairs, knowing of the existence and contents of the O\u2019Gara will. In fact, shortly prior to the execution of the Maclennan will a conversation had taken place between them respecting the validity of the charitable bequests in the first will. At this visit on the 11th Dr. Bergin saw the O\u2019Gara will left the day before by Mr. Maclennan, and Purcell and he began conversing about it. Several things are certain in regard to what happened at this conversation. First Purcell asked the Doctor to take this will to his brother Mr. John Bergin, a practising barrister and solicitor at Cornwall, and get a written opinion from him as to the validity of the charitable bequests therein made. Secondly, Dr. Bergin called the testator\u2019s attention to the fact that Stuart was one of the executors and suggested a change to which he agreed. There was a suggestion (it is not absolutely certain that it was the Dr.\u2019s suggestion) that John Bergin should be appointed in his place and (according to Dr. Bergin\u2019s account of Purcell\u2019s statement) he, Dr. Bergin, was instructed to get his brother, John Bergin, to draw up a codicil appointing John Bergin executor in lieu of Stuart. Thirdly, Purcell concealed from the Doctor the facts that the day before he had executed the Maclennan will, that Stuart was no longer an executor and that the O\u2019Gara will had been revoked. There is, I think, only one explanation for this concealment, for it is impossible that on this matter Purcell\u2019s memory was in fault. He was then in a very weak state physically, trying to recover from an illness brought on by excess in the matter of stimulants to the inordinate use of which he was addicted. He was afraid to tell the Doctor of the contents of the Maclennan will and particularly of the fact that Mr. Maclennan had been made an executor. He foolishly imagined that his Doctor, the medical man on whose skill and attention he relied for the prolongation of his life, would be annoyed were he to know that his own brother had been overlooked and another solicitor in. the same town appointed, and he deliberately resolved to deceive him as to the exact condition of affairs, which resolve he kept, for neither the Doctor nor his brother ever knew of the existence of the Maclennan will until after Purcell\u2019s death, several months afterwards. He knew too that the O\u2019Gara will then before them had been revoked, that it was a mere piece of waste paper, and he thought that the appointment of John Bergin as an executor of that instrument would have no valid effect, the will of the day before being the only testament then in force.\nIt seems to me absolutely out of the question to suppose that, by this time at least, his request as to the drafting of a codicil for the simple purpose of changing an executor indicated an intention to absolutely revoke and nullify the solemn instrument of the previous day and to restore all the numerous bequests in the O\u2019Gara will which the later instrument had either reduced or eliminated altogether.\nIt was perfectly reasonable and natural that he should be concerned about his charities and should be anxious for legal certitude as to the extent to which he might go in that direction, for the Maclennan will, as stated, had not disposed of the residue. There was perhaps half a million of dollars to be dealt with and it is extremely probable that he did contemplate either the making of a fresh testamentary disposition in respect to that or the spending of it in his life time in the erection and endowment of a hospital at Cornwall. At all events he is still uncertain. He is seeking light. There is no manifestation of any wish in the meantime to undo the work of yesterday.\nWe come now to the following day, the 12th of January. Purcell is still thinking over his affairs. The Maclennan will had given $10,000 to the Bishop of Alexandria, and the O\u2019Gara will had contained a clause that it should be published in the local newspapers, which clause had been left out of the later will. Purcell now desires to reduce this bequest to $5,000 and to restore the provision as to publication, and his man of business, upon his instructions, writes to Mr. Maclennan the following letter:\u2014 SUMMERSTOWN, January 12th 1.891.\nD.B. MACLENNAN, Esq., Cornwall.\nIn re will.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Mr. Purcell wishes you to change the bequest to bishop Macdonell of Alexandria from ten thousand to five thousand dollars, and to insert a clause that upon his demise his will shall be inserted in the leading newspapers. You know how to act in regard to this clause.\nYour truly,\nGEO. MILDEN,\nfor P.P.\nThis codicil was prepared and sent to Purcell but it would seem that he died without his attention being again called to it.\nDoes not this letter, however, afford conclusive evidence that up to this time at least he had no intention of revoking the existing will, his instructions of the previous day in respect to Stuart and John Bergin, to the contrary, notwithstanding?\nIt does not seem clear that when Dr. Bergin returned home from his visit of the 11th that he asked his brother to draw the codicil then referred to. He did, however, leave with him the O\u2019Gara will and obtained from him a few days afterwards a written opinion as to the validity of the charitable bequests. This opinion the doctor handed to Purcell at the same time giving him a message that he should get the best legal advice that he could get in the province. Finally it was arranged that Dr. Bergin should take the will with him to Toronto with a view of obtaining the opinion of S.H. Blake Q.C. upon it. Dr. Bergin had a consultation with Mr. Blake on the 7th of March and on the 9th and 10th of March he communicated the advice then given to Purcell.\nThe following is the evidence of Dr. Bergin as to what then followed. The same Mr. Blake is examining him:\u2014 Q. What passed between you and Purcell at that meeting?\u2014A. I told Mr. Purcell that you had said to me that you could not look into the cases at such short notice and give an opinion, but that you would look into it, and your opinion was that he ought to do what he proposed to do or as much of it as he could at once in regard to these charitable bequests; I think I told you that his intention was, so far as this part of the country was concerned, to build a hospital and home for aged and indigent men and women, and I urged upon him to do that, and that was his idea I believe, and as I think there can be no doubt about it, but he had important interests in Nova Scotia connected with a contract, and very much against my will he went there.\nQ. He went to Nova Scotia, and at what date was it he went to Nova Scotia?\u2014A. He went to Nova Scotia about the 12th or 13th of April.\nQ. What had taken place in the meantime between this 8th or 9th March, when you returned from Toronto, in regard to will or codicil?\u2014A. He sent for me. He was taken ill with a sore hand. He had injured his hand, been upset, and we were very much alarmed about blood poisoning, and this was why I did not wish him to go away. On one of these visits, the 14th or 15th, he said to me: \u201cYou have not brought the codicil yet which I instructed you to have prepared long ago.\u201d\nQ. That was the 14th or 15th March he said to you, you haven\u2019t brought me the codicil which he had instructed you to get?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What did you say to him, doctor, upon that?\u2014A. Yes, it must have been the 15th, because I said I would bring it down tomorrow morning when I came.\nQ. What was this codicil he referred to as being the codicil he had spoken to you about?\u2014A. It was the codicil to this will of May, 1890, that was made in Ottawa, the O\u2019Gara will it was called.\nQ. And when was it he had spoken to you about the codicil to this will?\u2014A. After I came back from Toronto and told him you thought, under the circumstances, that he ought to provide for keeping that will alive.\nQ. Then how long after that did you see Mr. John Bergin and instruct him about the codicil?\u2014A. That same day.\nQ. And was the codicil prepared?\u2014A. He gave it to me that night.\nQ. And you, having gotten it, what did you do with it?\u2014A. Well, I kept possession of it till I went down there.\nThe doctor went down on the 16th, on which day the codicil was signed in his presence. At this time the original O\u2019Gara will was in John Bergin\u2019s posses- sion, and upon the execution of the codicil the testator requested the doctor to give it to his brother and to instruct him to attach it to his will (the O\u2019Gara will), which he subsequently did.\nThe testator died on the 1st of May following.\nIt is as well to insert here the further evidence of Dr. Bergin as to the drawing of the codicil.\nMr. BLAKE.\u2014Q. Was there, or was there not, anything said subsequent to the 16th March, anything in the way of recalling that codicil of that date or interfering with it in these conversations you had?\u2014A. Yes; he asked me whether my brother had sent the will and codicil to me again, and whether you had approved of it, and I told him I didn\u2019t know; I felt satisfied.\nQ. That is not what I am asking you. I am asking whether anything was said as to recalling this codicil of the 16th March, 1891, anything that expressed dissatisfaction with it, or the desire to have it cancelled, or any matter of that kind? A. No. The only conversations I had with him afterwards were more professional than any other, but they were on almost every occasion coupled with his views as to the hospital, and the kind of hospital he would build when he returned from Nova Scotia.\nQ. Then there is this allegation that I want you to speak to his lordship upon in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. \u201cThe plaintiff charges that the codicil of the 16th March, 1890, (this is clause 8), was executed at the instance of the testator\u2019s legal adviser, etc.\u201d (reads clause). Is that a fact, did you suggest, or did your brother John suggest, the execution of this codicil?\u2014A. The first my brother knew of it was the instructions I brought him from Mr. Purcell, and the first conversation that occurred between Mr. Purcell and me on the question of this codicil was on the 12th January, 1890, after having read the will and finding that Stuart\u2019s name was still on it. I asked Mr. Purcell when I went down there the next day whether it was wise for him to retain Stuart as one of his executors, and he said, \u201cNo, I intended to relieve him\u201d; and he said, \u201cWho am I to put in his place?\u201d I said, \u201cYou ought to have a good man, a business man, a man who knows something of managing estates, a prudent man and a man who will see that his brother executors do not fritter away the estate and divert it from the purposes for which you intend it.\u201d\nQ. And so it came from Patrick Purcell?\u2014A. Whether he suggested or I suggested that John Bergin should be the executor, I am not positive, because he repeated it over and over again, he is a proper man, and afterwards when I told him that John would accept it he said that he was delighted. Then no further conversation occurred between us after that in regard to the codicil until he gave me the instructions, I think on the 15th or 14th to have that codicil prepared; he said to me, \u201cYou haven\u2019t brought that codicil as I instructed.\u201d\nNow I do not gather from all or any of these facts as detailed by Dr. Bergin the slightest evidence of an actual intention to revive the O\u2019Gara will or revoke the Maclennan will. It was on the 14th or 15th March that Purcell said to the Doctor \u201cYou have not brought the codicil yet which I instructed you to prepare long ago.\u201d And these instructions must have been given on the 11th or 12th of January, long before he had been advised by Mr. Blake that the O\u2019Gara will should be \u201ckept alive.\u201d Besides there is no evidence that after that advice Purcell ever asked or suggested that a codicil should be drawn of that character or having that effect. \u201cIt may, I think, be doubted,\u201d said Lord Penzance in Re Steele, \u201cwhether any testator, who bore in mind that he had revoked his will and substituted another for it, ever really sat down with the purpose of revoking his last will and reviving the former one and set about the execution of that purpose by simply making a codicil referring by date to the first will, without more. Would any lawyer advise such a course, or would any unskilled testator imagine he could achieve the end by such a method? The leading idea of revoking the one and reviving the other in its place would surely find expression by some form of words in a paper designed mainly for that object\u201d[28].\nAnd so I say in the present case that if Purcell wanted to revoke the second and revive the first will he would have said so. He would have used some form of words having that effect. The fact is that instead of intending to give effect to the charitable dis- positions of the first will his intentions had altogether changed. He proposed to reduce still further his bounty to the Bishop of Alexandria, and \u201cto build a hospital and home for aged and indigent men and women\u201d at Cornwall. How, in view of all these facts, can it be contended that the surrounding circumstances show the intention claimed? There may have been, and I think there was, an idea in his mind of making, at some future time, some further testamentary disposition of the undisposed residue of his estate. There was, however, no idea that, by the mere execution of the codicil, he was restoring the first will and destroying the second. In referring to the acts and words of the testator subsequent to the execution of the Maclennan will I am not to be considered as holding that all such evidence was admissible\u2014that these were such surrounding circumstances as might be considered in construing the different instruments. The evidence was brought out, however, by those supporting the O\u2019Gara will and on that ground I have referred to it.\nI had intended dealing with Mr. Blake\u2019s argument as to the alleged mistake of the testator to which I have referred, but I find that so ably dealt with in Mr. Justice Gwynne\u2019s judgment that I find it unnecessary to add anything in respect to it.\nIf my view be correct it ends the case, and it should be declared that the will of the 10th January, 1891, is the only instrument entitled to probate.\nKING J.\u2014I agree with the learned judges of the Ontario Court of Appeal who have found that the will of May, 1890, was revived by the codicil of May, 1891, while appreciating the weight of the judgment to the contrary of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nIf express words of revivor are required to revive a revoked will by a codicil the codicil in question here fails of that effect. But no particular form of words is necessary. All that is required is that the codicil upon its face, and giving to the words the sense in which the testator is to be taken to have used them, shall show the intention to revive. This may be shown \u201ceither by express words referring to a will as revoked, and imputing an intention to revive the same, or by a disposition of the testator\u2019s property inconsistent with any other intention, or by expressions conveying to the mind of the court with reasonable certainty the existence of the intention in question\u201d[29]. In so construing the language of the codicil \u201cthe court ought always to receive such evidence of the surrounding circumstances as, by placing it in the position of the testator, will the better enable it to read the true sense of the words he has used\u201d29. One can see how a codicil referring to a previously revoked will by date might contain in its substantive provisions nothing that would be any more consistent with the revival of that will than with the confirmation of the revoking will. In such case it might well be a question whether the testator had not mistaken the dates, and really had in mind the real last will. An instance of this might be where the codicil referring to a will of the date of the revoked will simply made a bequest to a person not named in either will, or of an additional sum to a person named in both, as, for instance, if the testator here had by the codicil given a further sum to his wife. Such a provision would not add anything to the weight to be given to the mere date as indicative of an intention to revive the revoked will, for it would be as consistent with one view as the other. But the codicil here goes beyond that. First it purports to be a codicil to the will of May 14, 1890; it then makes a testamentary provision for the more effectual carrying out of that will by the revoking of so much of it as appointed Stuart as executor, and by the appointment in his place of Bergin, conferring upon him in terms all the powers and duties conferred and imposed upon Stuart as in the said will declared; and, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Maclennan, declares that the will in which he is making this change is \u201cthis, my will.\u201d There can be no question as to which will is meant. Upon the face of the codicil it is rendered certain by the reference to the date of the first will, and by the reference to a person who was an executor of the first will and not of the second. \u201cAmong pertinent circumstances that may be looked to\u201d [as Lord Hannen says in McLeod v. McNab[30],] in order to get the true sense of the words the testator has used, must be included the known contents of the revoking will of January 10, 1891. Similar circumstances as to the change of an executor named in the first instrument, but not in the second, were there held to lead inevitably to the conclusion that the first instrument was the one referred to. Here independent surrounding circumstances, not necessary to be detailed, justify the like conclusion.\nThe will of May 14th, 1890, being indisputably intended and being known to be a revoked will (unless the revocation were per incuriam) what is the proper conclusion to be drawn from a codicil calling it \u201cthis my will\u201d and cancelling the appointment of one of the executors named in it and appointing another in his place, with the powers and duties conferred by it? How could Bergin become an executor of such revoked will unless it were intended thereby to be revive? How could he have the same powers and duties as were conferred upon Stuart by that will unless it were to be a living will? I think that some sensible mean- ing is to be given to a deliberate and authentic act, and agree with the learned judges Burton, Osler, Maclennan and Robertson, that the expressions used in the codicil show with reasonable certainty the existence of an intention to revive. It is said that no unskilled testator would imagine he could thus revive a will; but, before the present act, testators, skilled and unskilled, were accustomed to do it by much less\u2014by simply making it plain that the codicil referred to the previously revoked will.\nIt is not possible to explain all of Purcell\u2019s conduct. It presents difficulties to any view, the least, perhaps, if we could think that the revocatory clause was executed per incuriam. I think, however, that he ought to be credited with some sense and some honesty. The making of a will was a serious thing with him, and his main concern lay in making provision out of his large means for various charities. By his first will the great bulk of his property was so devoted. It was only upon his being told that these charitable gifts might largely fail that he conceived the idea of recasting certain devises and bequests, and making such provision for charity as might be conveniently made out of his personal estate, other than such as might be secured by mortgage on real estate. This latter scheme he gave effect to by his will of January 10th, 1891, upon an off-hand opinion received from Mr. Maclennan in a brief interview. This will dealt with only about one-tenth of his property. If Mr. Maclennan\u2019s opinion had been otherwise there is no reason for supposing that the charitable bequests, and indeed the whole will would not have substantially remained as they were. The day after making the second will he continued the inquiry into the validity of the charitable bequests, introducing the subject to Dr. Bergin (whom he had telegraphed to two days before, desiring to see him on business), showing to Dr. Bergin the first will, and asking him to get the opinion of his brother (a solicitor) upon it. The next day he suggested to Mr. Maclennan alterations in the second will, a fact which shows, perhaps, merely that he was still acting on the advice that he had received from Mr. Maclennan.\nHe did not tell Dr. Bergin of the tentative will that he had made following upon Mr. Maclennan\u2019s advice. Seeking further advice he perhaps concluded to keep to himself the fact of having asked other advice. But whatever the reason he did not tell Dr. Bergin. Dr. Bergin advised the taking of the opinion of Mr. S. Blake Q.C., formerly a vice-chancellor of Ontario, and Dr. Bergin was authorized to consult Mr. Blake. Dr. Bergin says that Purcell said to him: \u201cTake that to Mr. Blake and if he thinks it requires a new will let him make it, or do whatever he thinks necessary, and after that bring it back.\u201d Purcell was informed that Mr. Blake said that the will ought to be kept alive, which, as explained, meant that in Purcell\u2019s then state of health a new will might not turn out to be executed long enough before the testator\u2019s death to make good charitable devises or bequests payable out of moneys charged on lands. Purcell then requested that a codicil providing for the appointment of Mr. John Bergin as executor instead of Stuart, which had been spoken of before, should be sent to him for execution and it was so sent and is the codicil in question. Stuart had been book-keeper for Purcell, but in the autumn previous differences had arisen between them and Stuart then ceased to be Purcell\u2019s book-keeper and went to the United States. John Bergin was substituted for him as an executor of the original will and was clothed with all the powers and duties by such will conferred on Stuart. I cannot believe that (as suggested) this was all a contrivance to mislead the Bergins. There is no assignable motive for such a piece of duplicity. The reasonable view is that his mind had got back to its first state and that he desired to revive the first will as his will, and to provide effectually for the carrying of it out.\nHaving the misfortune to differ upon this point from my learned brethren it is not at all useful to express an opinion upon the numerous and weighty matters that have been so very ably discussed by the several learned counsel.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: J.A.

Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the judgment in favour of plaintiff at the trial.\nThe plaintiff bought the steamer \"Effort,\" built in 1868, and repaired her extensively, almost rebuilding but using some of the old materials and the engine, boiler and machinery that had been in the \"Effort.\" She was then given the name of \"The Clansman\" and received a new register. The plaintiff effected insurance of \"The Clansman\" and in answer to the question \"when built,\" in the application replied \"in 1890\" the year in which the repairs were effected. A loss having occurred payment was resisted on the ground that this answer was a misrepresentation. Plaintiff obtained a verdict on the trial which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia from whose decision the defendant company appealed.\nHarris Q.C. for the appellant referred to Ionides v. Pacific Insurance Company[2]; and Rickards v. Murdoch[3]; in support of the contention that plaintiff had concealed a material fact.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent. The appeal depends on a question of fact, and the finding at the trial affirmed by the full court, will not be interfered with. Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Company[4]; Arpin v. The Queen[5].\nOn the merits the learned Counsel cited Lyon v. Stadacona Insurance Co.[6]; Connecticut Insurance Co. v. Luchs[7]; De Wolf v. New York Firemen Insurance Co.[8]; Gandy v. Adelaide Marine Insurance Co.[9].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal by defendants in an action on a policy of marine insurance upon the steamer \"Clansman.'' The policy was a time policy and contained an express warranty of seaworthiness. The defence relied upon was misrepresentation as to the age of the vessel. Application for insurance was on forms used by the insurers, requiring answers to certain questions. Two of the questions were: When built?\" and \"present condition?\" To the first the answer was \"1890.\" The second was not answered. It appeared upon the trial that in the fall of 1889 a steamer called the \"Effort\" that had been built in 1868, was put on the marine slip at Port Hawkesbury, in order to be retopped. Finding that she needed large repairs the planks were taken off, new floor timbers put in where necessary, also new top timbers, stanchions, rails, deck beams and deck, new ceiling to the extent of a half or two-thirds, and she was newly planked. The shape of stern and bow above water were altered. The work cost about $600 or $700, and was completed in the spring of 1890. The engine and boiler were not disturbed during the progress of the work. A new register was somehow obtained for the vessel under the name of the \"Clansman\"; and soon afterwards she was sold to the plaintiff who knew of the facts above stated.\nIt was found by Mr. Justice Ritchie that the representation that the vessel was built in 1890 was correct in point of fact, and this was upheld by the Supreme Court, McDonald C. J. and Weatherbe J., dissenting.\nWhere payment of a risk is resisted on the ground of misrepresentation it ought indeed to be made very clear that there has been such a misrepresentation. Davies v. National Insurance Company of New Zealand[10]. With unfeigned respect for the opinion of the learned judges forming the majority, it is difficult to resist the reasoning and conclusions of the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Weatherbe, that in this case there was such misrepresentation.\nA representation is to be construed according to the fair and obvious import of words, and is equivalent to an express statement of all the inferences naturally and necessarily arising from it[11]. It comprehends whatever would reasonably and necessarily be inferred by mercantile men from the language under the circumstances in which it was employed[12]. What was proposed to be insured and what was being inquired about was a thing and not a name, the thing or vessel called the \"Clansman.\" It was immaterial that she did not become the \"Clansman\" until 1890. The question was as to when she was built. Now vessels are ordinarily deemed to be built but once, and the question and answer in their fair and obvious import relate to the time when the vessel in question was first completed as a vessel; and the representation that she was built in 1890 is equivalent to an express statement that she was then a new vessel.\nWhen the work on the \"Effort\" was begun she was a vessel, and there was no time in the progressive substitution of new for old when she ceased to be a vessel in course of repair and alteration. This follows upon a consideration both of what was made new and of what was left in place, and is further evidenced by the fact that the work was carried on with the engine and boiler in position. The result was something very different from a new vessel. Most important and vital parts of the structure were old, both in material and construction. Such were the keel, keelson stringers, waterways, stem, stern post and aprons. These were not only weakened in material and fastening by time, wear and working, but were also less fit to receive the new fastening that the new work would call for. Manifestly, too, portions of the new work could not be as effectually fastened as if the like work were done in the ordinary course of building. Doubtless the owner did the best he could, but he could not turn a twenty year old vessel into a new one. Repairing or restoration with minor alteration is the proper term to express what was done. One of the learned judges gave much weight to the statement of the new register that the \"Clansman\" was built in 1890, but that learned judge would probably be among the first to admit that the age of the vessel is to be decided upon the evidence at large, and that the opinion of those who were concerned in affecting such registration cannot avail against the proved facts.\nThe proper conclusion upon the facts is that the \"Clansman\" was not a new vessel in the ordinary or indeed in any sense, nor a vessel built in 1890 in the ordinary or in any sense, but an old vessel with a new name, extensively repaired with minor alterations, and carrying about with her most considerable and essential portions of old material and construction. If the old name had been retained it would scarcely have occurred to any one to claim that it was anything else but the old vessel in a repaired state, and equally whether he knew or not, the underwriters were entitled to the facts in answer to their question.\nThen as to the effect of the misrepresentation. If made with intent to deceive the misrepresentation vitiates the policy however trivial or immaterial to the nature of the risk. If honestly made it vitiates only if material and if substantially incorrect. The test of materiality is the probable effect which the statement might naturally and reasonably be expected to produce on the mind of the underwriter in weighing the risk and considering the premium.\nThe age of a vessel is a point material to the risk. Ionides v. Pacific Ins. Co.[13]. And although many particulars respecting the age, condition or structure of the vessel which might reasonably affect the mind of the underwriter need not be disclosed unless asked about, at least where they are included in a warranty of seaworthiness express or implied, if the underwriter asks questions about them the answers must be substantially true or the effect is to avoid the policy.\nA question respecting the age of a vessel would prima facie be taken to imply that the underwriter considers the answer material, and in such case the answer may be presumed to have influenced his mind.\nIn the case before us there is nothing to rebut this prima facie presumption, and the representation is to be taken as material to the nature of the risk.\nIt is, however, a representation and not a warranty and, in the absence of intent to deceive, is satisfied by substantial compliance with fact. But a difference of twenty years is a very substantial difference in the age of a vessel and with the prima facie presumption against him arising from the asking of the question, and the absence of anything tending (as in Alexander v. Campbell[14].) to rebut the presumption, the reasonable conclusion upon the facts in evidence is that had the truth been known the underwriter would not have underwritten the policy upon the same terms.\nIt is further the opinion of the majority of the court that the representation was made with intent to deceive.\nThe result is that the appeal is to be allowed and judgment to be entered for the defendants below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The trial judge found, as a matter of fact, that the answer \"1890\" to the question \"when built,\" was substantially correct. That finding is concurred in by the court en banc. Under these circumstances we cannot, in my opinion, entertain this appeal. I would go further and say that, as I read the evidence, coupled with the registry of the ship, the respondent would not have given a true answer if he had said that the ship was built in 1868. It was not all new; old materials were 1 certainly used, but she was nevertheless built, and came to life as \"The Clansman\" in 1890. I adopt the reasoning of Ritchie, Graham and Meagher JJ. in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harris & Henry.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\n[1] 25 N.

In getting this release he represented that the estate would be sacrificed if sold at auction, and the most could be made of it by letting him have full control of the property. He then took out letters of administration to Edward Mack's estate, but took no further proceedings in the Probate Court and managed the property as his own until he died in 1888. During that time he wrote several letters to the widow of Edward Mack, in most of which he stated that he was dealing with the property for her benefit, and would see that she lost nothing by giving him control of it. After his death the widow brought an action against his executors, asking for an account of the partnership between her husband and Henry Mack, and of his dealings with the property since her husband's death and payment of her share; she also asked to have the release set aside. The defendants relied on the release as valid, and also pleaded that plaintiff by delay in pressing her claims was precluded from maintaining her action.\nThe Supreme Court held, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the release should be set aside; that it was given in ignorance of the state of the partnership business and Edward Mack's affairs, and the plaintiff was dominated by the stronger will of Henry Mack; that the latter had divested himself of his legal title by admitting in his letters a liability to the plaintiff, and must be treated as a trustee; that as a trustee lapse of time would not bar plaintiff from proceeding against him for breach of trust; and that the delay in pressing plaintiff's claim was due to Henry Mack himself, who postponed from time to time the giving of a statement of the business when demanded by the plaintiff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nBorden Q.C. for appellant.\nNewcome and McInnes for respondent.\n"}

R. 33) distinguished.\nHeld further, that it was an incumbrance even if the condition meant an incumbrance on the policy.\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment for defendants at the trial.\nThe action in this case was on a policy of insurance against fire on plaintiff's stock in trade, which policy contained, among others, the following condition:\n\"Condition no. 2.\u2014Title. If the interest of the assured in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of the property, for the use and benefit of the assured, or if the property insured stands on leased or borrowed ground, it must be so represented to the company, and so expressed in the written part of this policy, otherwise the policy shall be void. Property or goods of any kind held as collateral on commission in trust or on storage, or sold, delivered or not delivered, or any other interest than absolute, are not insured hereunder, as well as leaseholds, rents, improvements, unless so designated and so specifically insured.\"\n\"This policy or any interest in it, shall not be assignable without the consent of the company expressed by indorsement made hereon, and all encumbrances effected by the assured must be notified within fifteen days therefrom, otherwise this policy shall be void. In event of any sale, transfer or change of title in the property insured the liability of the company shall thenceforth cease.\nThe insured, during the currency of this policy, gave to Gault Bros. & Co., of Montreal, to whom he was indebted, a chattel mortgage on all the property so insured, and also \"all policies of insurance on the said stock and all renewals thereof,\" without first obtaining the consent of the company to be indorsed on the policy. The defendants claimed that this chattel mortgage was a breach of the above condition and rendered the policy void.\nAs to the contention of the company that the assignment of the policy was a breach of the condition see London Ins.

Newcombe Q.C. in reply referred to Burlinson v. Hall[3]; Tancred v. Delagoa Bay &c. Railway Co.[4].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in favour of the plaintiff, in an action against the appellants, as defendants, upon two several policies of fire insurance executed by the appellants, the one for $1,000, and the other for $2,000 upon certain stock in trade of the plaintiff mentioned and described in the policies. The policies are indentical in every respect except in the amounts by them respectively insured. Each policy was subject to the following, among other conditions:\u2014\nCondition no. 2.\u2014Title. If the interest of; he assured in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the property for the use and benefit of the assured, or &c, &c, it must be so represented to the company and so expressed in the written part of the policy, otherwise the policy shall be void. This policy or any interest in it shall not be assignable without the consent of the company expressed by indorsement made hereon and all incumbrances effected by the assured must be notified within fifteen days therefrom, otherwise this policy shall be void. In the event of any sale, transfer or change of title, in the property, the liability of the company shall thenceforth cease.\nBy an indenture bearing date the 18th October, 1890, and while these policies were in force, the plaintiff granted, bargained, sold, assigned, transferred and set over all the stock in trade whereon the said insurances were by the said policies effected, and also all policies of insurance on the said stock and all renewals thereof, to Gault Brothers and Company, of Montreal, by way of security for payment to them of the sum of nine thousand and seventy-two dollars, to have and to hold, to them and their assigns upon trust upon breach of any of the covenants, provisoes and agreements in the said indenture contained to sell the same either by private sale or public auction, and out of the proceeds arising from such sale to pay all the expenses connected with the said indenture and the said sale, and then to retain and reimburse themselves the said sum of nine thousand and seventy-two dollars with interest thereon at and after the rate of five per centum per annum, or any balance that may then be due to them, rendering the balance, if any there be, to the said plaintiff, his executors, administrators, or assigns, provided always that if the plaintiff should well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the said Gault Brothers and Company or their assigns the said sum of $9,072 with interest thereon at the rate aforesaid, the whole to be paid within eighteen months from the first day of November, 1890, in instalments made payable at certain days and hours in the said indenture mentioned, then that the said indenture should become void, but otherwise should remain in full force and effect; and it was by the said indenture agreed, that until default in payment or other default, it should be lawful for the plaintiff to retain possession and use of the said goods, chattels and premises thereby conveyed or intended so to be, and to sell and dispose of the same in the ordinary and usual course of trade. Provided always and it was thereby agreed, by and between the parties thereto, that if any legal proceedings should be taken or any judgment entered against the said plaintiff by any person or persons, or execution issued against him or attempted to be levied on said property thereby conveyed or intended so to be, or any part thereof be seized, attached or distrained upon, or in case of any other default in the provisions of the said indenture, then that it should be lawful for the said Gault Brothers and Company, &c., &c., to take immediate possession of and sell the said property as thereinbefore provided, before the expiration of the said period of eighteen months.\nSome time in the month of December, 1890, prior to the 18th, certain creditors of the plaintiff entered suit against him and thereby, in the terms of the said indenture, the goods, stock in trade, &c., assured by the said policies became absolutely vested in Gault Bros., upon trust to sell for the purpose in the said indenture of the 11th October, 1890, mentioned. Gault Bros, never gave notice to the appellants of the execution of that indenture, nor of the assignment therein contained of the said stock and policies, until some time after the destruction of the said goods, &c, by fire on the 31st December, 1890. Upon the 2nd January, 1891,they, by their solicitors, Messrs. Harrington & Chisholm, gave such notice in a letter of that date addressed to Wm. Duffus Esq., agent of the appellants, which is as follows:\u2014\nHALIFAX, January 2nd, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014We beg to inform you that all policies of insurance which James W. Salterio holds on the stock in trade owned by him, and consumed by fire in the Globe Hotel building on Wednesday night, were assigned by him to Gault Bros. & Co., of Montreal, by chattel mortgage dated the 18th day of October, 1890. The mortgage contained a covenant to insure the goods for our client's benefit. It is true we did not get the policies assigned by indorsement thereon made with your assent, but if that is necessary it can be done now after the loss. At present we wish simply to notify you of our client's rights and that they are the persons entitled to the insurance, their interests being upwards of nine thousand dollars.\nYours truly,\nSgd. HARRINGTON & CHISHOLM.\nAttorneys of Gault Bros. & Co.\nThe actions were resisted upon the contention that the policies were avoided by the execution of the deed of October 18th, 1890, and the assignment therein contained of the policies without the assent of the appellants, but the learned trial judge held that as the condition indorsed on the policies declared that these policies could not be assigned without the consent of the appellants indorsed thereon, and as no such assent had been obtained, they were not in fact assigned and that no breach of the condition which had the effect of avoiding the policies had taken place and he therefore rendered judgment for the plaintiff.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia maintained this judgment upon the authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in the case of Lazarus v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.[5] But that case, even if it were a binding authority, was very different from the present. The policy of insurance under consideration there was effected upon the 21st October, 1824, upon a ship of the plaintiff by Smith & Stewardson, creditors of the plaintiff, for their own security, they paying the premium, and to them the money, in case of loss, was made payable, although the policy was effected in the name of the plaintiff. The policy contained a clause whereby it was agreed that the policy should be void in case of its being assigned, transferred or pledged without the previous consent in writing of the assurers, and on the 23rd December, 1824, the plaintiff executed an indenture whereby he assigned to one Street all his interest in certain vessels, &c., &c., all goods and stock in trade and bonds, &c., &c., policies of insurance, debentures, &c, &c\u201e belonging to the said Michael Lazarus, or in which he has any right, title or interest, property, lien or claim whatever, in trust for sale, and to apply the proceeds in payment of the plaintiff's creditors and to pay and apply any surplus balance to the plaintiff. At the time this instrument was executed Smith & Stewardson were in possession of the policy and held it as security for their claims. That claim was paid off subsequently to the execution of the indenture to Street. The jury found that after payment of all the plaintiff's debts and a release executed to him by his creditors there was a surplus of the assigned property reverting to the plaintiff, including the policy in question. The vessel upon which it had been effected was lost by peril insured against. Upon this state of facts the court said:\nAt the time when the indenture to Street was made the policy was in the hands of Smith & Stewardson who were then in advance to the plaintiff. They procured it to be made and the defendants agreed to pay the money to them in case of loss. They might have maintained an action upon this policy in their own names against the defendants. Now it would seem that the plaintiff could not have deprived them of the benefits secured to them by this contract without their consent. It is true that the plaintiff afterwards paid his debt to them, but that circumstance does not show that the defendants might not have been liable to them for any loss upon this policy which might have happened after the assignment and before they received their payment from the plaintiff. If the policy was made void it was avoided by the act of assignment; and if it were so avoided, it would follow that Smith & Stewardson's rights, which were secured by the policy, would have been destroyed, without their consent.\nIn this state of facts, and upon this reasoning, the court came to the conclusion that the parties to the indenture to Street had no intention whatever to assign thereby the policy in question, of which Smith and Stewardson were so in possession as beneficial owners, and that as there was no intention that the policy should pass by that indenture it did not pass, and was not affected thereby.\nNow in the present case there was the clearest intention that the policies in question here should pass to Gault Bros. & Co., under the indenture of the 18th October, 1890. There is clear evidence of the express intention of the parties that they should pass, and by the above letter of the solicitors of Gault Bros. & Co., to the appellants, notifying them of the assignment, it is apparent that they relied upon obtaining afterwards the assent of the appellants to such assignment, and the intention of the plaintiff is further placed beyond question by the power of attorney bearing date the 19th day of January 1891, executed by him to Mr. Chisholm as the agent and attorney of Gault Bros., wherein he recites the execution of the indenture of the 18th October, 1890, and that his claim against the appellants, which claim only existed under the said policies, had been equitably assigned by him to Gault Bros, as further collateral security for the payment of the debt secured by the said indenture of October, 1890. There is no suggestion that this equitable assignment took place otherwise than by the indenture of 18th October, 1890.\nIt, then, being the clear intention of the parties to the indenture of the 18th October, 1890, that the policies under consideration should pass, this case is quite distinguishable from Lazarus v. The Commonwealth Insurance Company[6]; and the language of the indenture being sufficient to include these policies we must hold the policies to have been avoided.\nThen, again, it appears by the same condition no. 2 that the policies were effected upon the assurance and faith that the assured had the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the property insured for the use and benefit of the insured, and it was provided by the last clause of that condition that \"in the event of any sale, transfer or change of title in the property insured, the liability of the company should thenceforth cease.\" Now although the case of Sovereign Insurance Co. v. Peters[7], which has also been relied upon in the courts below, may well be an authority for holding that the words \"sale\" and \"transfer\" in this sentence must, as the word \"assign\" in The Sovereign Ins. Co. v. Peters[8], be construed as meaning an absolute assignment, sale or transfer, and so that such words would not include a mortgage, still, to the words \"change of title,\" a more extended meaning must be attached. They must be construed to comprehend any \"change\" from the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the insured in the property insured; and that a chattel mortgage is such a change of title cannot, I think, be doubted. So likewise does it, as appears to me, come within the words of the condition which provides that all \"encumbrances effected by the assured must be notified within fifteen days therefrom, otherwise the policy shall be void.\" This word \"encumbrances\" here used refers more naturally to the property insured than to the policy, but if it is to be understood as meaning an \"encumbrance\" or charge upon the policy itself, the assignment in the indenture of the policies contained in the indenture of 18th October, 1890, intending to operate as collateral security to Gault Bros. & Co. for the debt secured by the indenture, is, I think, such an \"encumbrance,\" which, by the means of the transfer not being assented to by the appellants as required by the condition in the policies, avoids the policies.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered in the court below for the defendants, with costs\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Hector McInnes.\nSolicitor for respondent: John M.

In an action for damages for such injury:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that by the evidence at the trial negligence against the company was sufficiently proved.\nHeld further, that whether or not there was a common employment between H. and the servant of the company was a question of fact and it having been negatived by the finding of the jury, and the evidence warranting such finding, an appellate court would not interfere.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming th\u00e9 verdict at the trial for the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case were as follows\u2014\nIn 1890 the defendant company was engaged in laying down a new main in Dock Street, in St. John, and connecting the service pipes to the houses and shops along the streets. Finding that its own men were unable to make the connections as fast as was desired, Davenport, the defendants' manager who was in charge of the work, applied to one Freeman Wisdom, in whose employ the plaintiff was, for a man to assist the company's own men in making these connections, and Wisdom sent the plaintiff for the purpose. He worked one whole day, and in the early part of the second day some gas which had been allowed to escape through the main became ignited from fire from a salamander being used in carrying on the work an explosion took place and the plaintiff was injured. The valve by which the gas was shut off from the main was some six or eight hundred feet from the point where the men were working when the accident took place. When work was discontinued each evening the end of the new main was closed so that the gas could be turned on for the use of those whose houses or shops had already been connected. It was turned off again in the morning before the work was resumed, and as the service pipes were connected by the plaintiff and others engaged in doing that part of the work, the connections would be tested for leakage by the gas being turned on the main and a light applied at the connection to see if there was any escape. It would then be shut off again. It seems that the man whose duty it was to shut off the main did not, on the morning of the accident, altogether close the valve, which allowed some pressure and caused an escape of gas through the main and led, as is alleged, to the explosion which took place, and by which the plaintiff was injured. On the trial certain questions were submitted to the jury which, with their answers thereto, were as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the plaintiff injured by the negligent act or omission of defendants or their servants? A. Yes.\n2. If so, could the plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided the consequence of such negligence? A. No.\n3. Was the plaintiff at the time of the accident acting as a servant of the defendants, and under their direction and control? A. He, the plaintiff, was acting under the direction of the defendants as a servant of F. W. Wisdom, and under his, Wisdom's, control.\n4. Was the plaintiff at the time of the accident acting as the servant of defendants? A. No.\n5. Was the plaintiff at the time of the accident acting under the control of defendants? A. No.\n6. Did the plaintiff impliedly undertake to become the servant of defendants? No.\n7. Was the plaintiff at the time of the accident acting under independent employment or was he acting for the defendants and as their servant and under their control in and about their work? A. He was acting under independent employment.\nThe Court\u2014You mean by that, Mr. Wisdom, of course? Foreman\u2014Yes.\n8. If the injury was caused by the negligence of the defendants' servants was the plaintiff a fellow servant of the company with such servant, and engaged with him in a common employment? A. No.\nOn these findings the judge ordered a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff, the defendants having leave to move to enter it for them. A motion for that purpose having been made a rule was refused. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nHazen for the appellants. There is no evidence of a contract between the company and Wisdom by which the latter was to be paid for the plaintiff's services. Therefore plaintiff was not Wisdom's servant when he was working for the company. See Donovan v. Laing, &c., Construction Syndicate[1], judgment of Bowen L. J.\nThe plaintiff and the person whose act caused the injury complained of were working for the same master and were in a common employment for the company. Rourke v. White Moss Colliery Co.[2]; Johnson v. Lindsay[3]\nCurrey for the respondent referred to Swainson v. North Eastern Railway Co.[4]; Warburton v. The Great Western Railway Co.[5]; Vose v. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[6]\nFOURNIER J\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I think Mr. Justice King's reasoning in the court below unanswerable, and the answer of the jury to question 8, for which there is evidence, concludes the case.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was brought for injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants to the plaintiff when employed as the servant of one Wisdom, a steamfitter, in connecting amain gas pipe of the defendants laid by them in a street called Dock Street in the city of St. John, in New Brunswick, with certain small pipes leading into the houses and to the lamps on said street, for the purpose of lighting the said houses and street lamps with gas. The defence pleaded is, that at the time of the plaintiff's suffering the injury complained of he was a servant of the defendants, and acting as such together with other servants of the defendant, in one common employment, and doing one common work for the defendants, and that the said servants so employed were reasonably fit and competent to be so employed in such work, and that the grievance of which the plaintiff complains was occasioned by the carelessness, negligence and improper conduct of said servants of the defendants, so engaged in one common employment with the plaintiff, doing the common work of the defendants and not from any personal negligence, carelessness or improper conduct of the defendants. The issue joined upon this defence involved mere questions of fact, and the jury who tried the issue found as matters of fact, in answer to certain questions put to them by the learned judge, before whom such issue was tried.\n1st. That the plaintiff was injured by the negligent act or omission of the defendants or their servants.\n2nd. That the plaintiff could not, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the consequence of such negligence.\n3rd. That the plaintiff, at the time of the injury happening, was acting under the directions of the defendants, as a servant of F. W. Wisdom and under his, Wisdom's, control.\n4th. That the plaintiff was not acting as the servant of the defendants.\n5th. Nor under the control of the defendants.\n6th. Nor had the plaintiff impliedly undertaken to be the servant of the defendants.\n7th. But was acting under independent employment, namely, the employment of Wisdom.\nAnd they rendered a verdict in favour of the plaintiff for $1,250.\nUpon a motion to set aside a judgment for the plaintiff and enter judgment for the defendants pursuant to leave reserved, or for a new trial, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick after argument refused a rule, and maintained the verdict. From that judgment this appeal is taken. If the findings of the jury, upon the matters of fact so found by them, are well found, there can be no question that the plaintiff is entitled to maintain the verdict so rendered in his favour; and the well established rule of this court is, that upon such pure matters of fact the court cannot interfere unless it be conclusively established that the findings of the jury are so entirely wrong, and so unwarranted by the evidence, as to justify the conclusion, either that the jury did not appreciate their duty or acted wilfully in violation of it. In the present case the findings of the jury are open to no such imputation; indeed they are, in my judgment, in perfect accord with the evidence. The plaintiff was a servant of Wisdom, employed by him in his business of a steamfitter at $7 per week. The defendants were desirous of employing a competent mechanic to make connections between the new main pipe they were laying in the street with the pipes from the houses and the lamps upon the street in which the main pipe was being laid by the defendants, and for this purpose they applied to Wisdom who undertook to make the connections, and sent his servant for that purpose. For the services rendered by the plaintiff Wisdom charged the defendants what he considered a reasonable price as upon a quantum meruit, and was paid his demand by the defendants. The plaintiff in doing the work which he did acted as the servant of Wisdom, and was paid by him as his hired servant at $7.00 per week. The defendants not only never hired plaintiff, or. agreed to pay him for his services, but he was in no sense under the control of the defendants, nor under their directions, save in so far that they pointed out the places where the connections were to be made.\nAll the cases relating to the principle of a defendant's exemption from liability for injuries occasioned to one servant from the negligence of another servant, or other servants, of the defendant, employed together with the plaintiff in one common employment, and in one common work for the same master, have been most thoroughly and exhaustively discussed in the court below, and not one of them countenances the conclusion that this plaintiff, under the circumstances in evidence, must be held to be a fellow worker with the other servants of the defendants whose negligence caused the injury which the plaintiff suffered. There is no countenance for the contention that the plaintiff was lent by Wisdom to the defendants so as to have become the servant of the defendants, and under their control, and so as to make applicable the principle which exempts a master from liability for an injury sustained by one of his servants from the negligence of another, when both are engaged in one common employment for their master. The persons who caused the injury to plaintiff were at least two, namely, the man whose duty it was nightly to turn on the power into the main in Dock Street, so as to light the houses and lamps in the street, and to turn it off in the morning, and who neglected to do so sufficiently on the morning that the plaintiff received his injury, and the person who left the salamander, or stoker, as it has been indifferently called, at the place where it was, quite close to the place where the plaintiff was working at an open hole in the main pipe, where he was making connection with a pipe from a neighbouring house. The man who neglected to turn off the power effectually spoke of his duty in that particular as being his ordinary duty for many years, namely, to turn on the power every evening and to turn it off every morning; and he gave the only evidence that was given as to how the fire in the salamander or stoker came to be placed where it was, close to the hole in the main at which the plaintiff was working, where it was not at the time at all required. He says that it was removed from a place where he himself had placed it not long before, and where, in it had been suffered to remain, the plaintiff could not have received the injury; that the accident which injured him could not have happened, and that it was removed from that place and placed where it was by the order of the defendants' manager. If this be so, and this was the only evidence upon this point, then the defendants themselves, through their manager, were a party to the injury which the plaintiff suffered.\nBut it is quite unnecessary to dwell upon this. It is sufficient to say that the question wh ther the plaintiff was the defendants' servant, and under their control, and a co-labourer employed in one common employment with the persons who, being servants of the defendants, negligently caused the plaintiff the injury of which he complains, was a mere question of fact, which it was the office of the jury to determine, and that their findings cannot be said to be so manimanifestly erroneous as to justify a court to set aside their findings, and either to assume their function, or to order a new trial.\nSEDGEWICK, J.\u2014I concur, but with the greatest hesitation, in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nSolicitors for the appellants: Barker & Belyea.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

The alleged invention consisted of double leaves half being bound together and the other half folded in as fly-leaves with a carbonized leaf bound in next the cover and provided with a tape across the end. What was claimed as new in this invention was the device, by means of the tape, for turning over the carbonized leaf without soiling the fingers or causing it to curl up. H. made and sold a similar check book with a like device but instead of the tape the end of the carbonized leaf, for about half an inch, was left without carbon and the leaf was turned over by means of this margin. In an action by C. & Co. against H. for infringement of their patent:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Exchequer Court, that the evidence at the trial showed the device for turning over the black leaf without soiling the fingers to have been used before the patent of C. & Co., was issued and it was therefore not new; that the only novelty in the said patent was in the use of the tape; and that using the margin of the paper instead of the tape was not an infringement.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the plaintiffs' action for infringement of their patent.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment of the court.\nW. Cassels Q.C., and Edgar for the appellants. The tape was a sufficient novelty to entitle us to a patent. Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[2]; Gould v. Rees[3]. The defendants used a colourable variation from our patent and infringed the combination; Proctor v. Bennis.[4]; Machine Co. v. Murphy[5].\nJohnston Q. C., and Heighington for the respondents referred to Murray v. Clayton[6]; Harris v. Rothwell[7] in support of their argument that defendant's book was merely an improvement on that of the plaintiffs and not an infringement.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nKING J.\u2014This action was brought to restrain defendants from making, using or selling counter check books alleged by the plaintiffs to be an infringement of a patent of which they were the assignees granted February 15th, 1882, to one Carter. Upon the trial, before Mr. Justice Burbidge, the action was dismissed.\nThe subject of plaintiffs patent is called \"The Paragon Black leaf check book,\" and was before the Court in The Grip Printing and Publishing Co. v. Bullerfield[8] It is a book for use in shops for the making of duplicate entries by means of carbonized paper. In his specification the patentee said:\nI am aware that black leaves are used in other forms of books used in transferring writing from one page to another, but they are either loose in the book and are therefore easily lost, and are dirty to handle, or are placed in the centre of the book and the leaf numbered on either side of it, which latter arrangement is faulty from the fact that the space left on each side of the black leaf when the leaves are torn out causes the black leaf to curl up and become unsatisfactory in its operation.\nAs a matter of fact the Muma & MacKay book, which was prior to the Carter patent, had the black leaf, with the composition on but one side, bound into the book next to the cover; and it had these in combination with the perforated fly-leaf which is also an element in the Carter combination. The object of the Carter invention is thus stated in the specifications:\nThe object of the invention is to provide a check book in which the black leaf used in transferring writing from one page to another need not be handled and will not have a tendency to curl up after a number of leaves have been torn out, and it consists essentially of a black leaf check book composed of double leaves, one half of which are bound together, while the other half are folded in as fly leaves, both being perforated across so that they can readily be torn out, the black leaf being bound into the book next to the cover and provided with a tape bound across its end, the said black leaf having the transferring composition on one of its sides only. What I claim as my invention is: In a black leaf check book composed of double leaves one-half of which are bound together, while the other half folds in as fly leaves both being perforated across so that they can readily be torn out, the combination of the black leaf bound into the book next the cover and provided with the tape bound across its end, the said black leaf having the transferring composition on one of its sides only.\nWhen the book is opened for use the black leaf is found lying on top of the double folded leaf. The first thing to be done is to disengage the free, or fly leaf part of the double leaf and place it on the top of the black leaf; this done the black leaf lies between the two parts of the folded double leaf, and is ready for use. The purpose of the tape was to enable the salesman to throw back or raise the black leaf, and so disengage the fly leaf without soiling the fingers, and also to raise it again when tearing out the under leaf from the stub without soiling the fingers, a matter of some importance when certain goods were to be handled. It appears, however, to have been very soon found in practice that there was no practical advantage in the use of the tape, and at an early period the patentee and his assignees discarded it and manufactured and put upon the market as the patented article, \"The Paragon Black leaf Counter Check book\" without the tape, discontinuing the manufacture of the patented article. The books so manufactured and put upon the market are found by the learned judge to be substantially similar to the Muma & MacKay book of 1871, which was in use in Canada from that time down to the granting of the plaintiffs' patent. In neither of these books is there tape, but in either of them the black leaf may be raised for the several purposes for which it is required to be raised without touching the carbon and therefore without soiling the fingers This may be effected either by bending back the flexible book at the point of binding, and so causing the free ends of the leaves to fall apart, or by making use of the upper or clean side of the black leaf to move it away from the margin sufficiently to get at the leaf lying under it, or, as stated in the evidence, by the aid of the fly leaf if it is extended. A very slight use of the book would accustom one to these movements. In the cross examination of Mr. Ridout, a patent solicitor called by the appellant, he said in reply to the learned judge that if the patentee had had the experience when he patented it that he had subsequently he need not have put in the tape at all as he would have seen that the fly leaf accomplished the same result. This witness also stated that the tape was unnecessary and that the combination was essentially one of only two elements viz.: the carbon leaf bound in next to the cover and the perforated fly leaf, one of which (i.e., the perforated fly leaf) performs a double function.\nThe effect of this might be to show that the patent, in that which was distinctive of it as a combination or otherwise, had no utility beyond what was found in the anterior combination, and so was without consideration. Mr. Cassels as to this says, first that the fly-leaf answers the purpose of the tape only under certain conditions; and secondly, that the defendants upon the trial admitted the utility of the plaintiffs' patent. Such an admission was indeed formally made, and is referred to by the learned judge in giving judgment.\nApart, however, from any question of utility, the fact of the practical discarding of the tape, and of its apparently superfluous character, are not without importance in another point of view presently to be adverted to.\nThe plaintiffs' combination is therefore to be taken as useful and (so far as these books are concerned) the method of raising the carbon leaf by a tape attached to it may be taken to be a new method. Then the question is: Have the defendants infringed the plaintiffs' patent? It is claimed that they have; that they have made substantially the same combination and have varied from it only colourably. In the defendants' book there is a contrivance for turning the carbonized leaf (which in their book forms part of the flexible cover) without soiling the fingers. Their method consists in leaving a margin of about half an inch free from carbon.\nThe question on this is: Has the plaintiffs' combination in substance been taken? In Proctor v. Bennis,[9], Cotton L. J. stated the question thus:\nHas the defendant, though not exactly taking the whole combination which has been patented, taken, by slight variations or by mechanical equivalents, the substance of it so as to produce the same result by practically the same means?\nThe answer to that depends to some extent on the nature and object of the invention.\nIn Curtis v. Platt[10], Wood Y. C. says:\nWhere the thing is wholly novel and one which has never been achieved before, the machine itself which is invented necessarily contains a great amount of novelty in all its parts, and one looks very narrowly and very jealously upon any other machines for effecting the same object to see whether or not they are merely colourable contrivances for evading that which has been done before. When the object itself is one which is not new, but the means only are new, one is not inclined to say that a person who invents a particular means of doing something that has been, known to all the world long before has a right to extend very largely the interpretation of those means which he has adopted for carrying it into effect.\nThis was affirmed by Lord Westbury L.C., on appeal[11].\nIn Proctor v. Bennis,[12] the Court of Appeal commented upon Curtis v. Platt (1) and dwelt upon the distinction between cases of combination for an old object and cases of combination for a new object.\nCotton L. J. says:\nIn applying the words used by the judges in that case (Curtis v. Platt (1)) we must consider the nature of the case before them, (viz.: \"an improvement in a machine which had been long in use for producing a certain result,\" and I come to the conclusion that what they meant was that where there is no novelty in the result, and where the machine is not a new one, but the claim is only for improvements in a known machine for producing a known result, the patentee must be tied down strictly to the invention which he claims, and the mode which he points out for effecting the improvement.\nAnd see also per Bowen L. J., p, 764, and Fry L. J., at pp. 767, 768.\nNow the case before us is that of a combination for an old object rather than for a new object. In substance, although not in terms, it is for an improvement in a known contrivance for producing an old result. Check books with carbon leaf carbonized on but one side and bound in next to the cover and with double perforated leaves were known contrivances with a known object prior to plaintiffs' patent. In the use of such book by salesmen they would know that, without the exercise of care, the fingers might become soiled, and any one whose business might lead to the handling of delicate fabrics at the same time would naturally use the books in a way to avoid soiling the fingers, and in doing so would make use of the mechanical aids which the book afforded. The Muma & MacKay book did afford fairly adequate means of doing this by the carbon leaf being free of carbon on one side and by the perforated fly leaf, and what is of some importance is that the practical discarding by the plaintiffs of the tape (their special device for avoiding the soiling of the fingers) and their putting upon the market \"The Paragon Black leaf Counter Checkbook\", without the tape as their patented article, with no substantial variation from the prior book of Muma & MacKay, in preference to, and in substitution for, their patented combination, goes to show that the results they sought to attain by their patented article were adequately attained by the old means, and that their patent was, in reality, not the case of a combination productive of entirely new result but a supposed improvement in the means of affecting an old object. This is also the proper conclusion upon the evidence at large. It is clear that all the results attained by the patented book are attainable (although perhaps not with equal facility) by the book which plaintiffs are manufacturing and putting on the market; and that the same results could have been effected and no doubt in practice must have been frequently effected (although perhaps with still less facility) by the persons who, prior to plaintiffs' patent, had occasion to use the Muma & MacKay book, the fly leaf (as expressed by Ridout and as found by the learned judge) performing a double function. The case therefore is not like that of Proctor v. Bennis[13] where the combination was a new invention with a novel result; but rather comes within the class of cases dealt with in Curtis v. Platt[14] where there was no novelty in the results, but where the only novelty which could be claimed was that of improvement in the application and use of certain mechanical means in order to produce in a known article the same result which in it had been produced by other mechanical means. The turning over of a carbon leaf in these books without touching the carbon cannot be considered novel. The novelty introduced by plaintiffs lies in turning it over by means of an attached tape.\nWe are not therefore to extend very largely the interpretation of those means which the plaintiffs have adopted for carrying their object into effect, although they are to be protected against merely colourable variations. There must necessarily be considerable similarity in the different ways of turning a leaf, and where one seeks to establish a right in respect of a mode of doing such a simple thing and for a well known purpose it seems only reasonable to confine him with some strictness to the particular means or methods which he adopts. The two ways of turning back a leaf as shown in the two check books are as diverse as one could expect considering the nature of the thing to be done. The one is not a mere colourable variation from the other, but an essentially different means for producing what appears to have been the common and well-known object.\nIt would be an extraordinary result if the plaintiffs could hold the field with their disused device and prevent others from trying other, and perhaps less sterile, means of effecting the same far from novel object or result. The conclusion therefore is that there has been no infringement of the plaintiffs' patent, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Edgar & Malone.\nSolicitors for respondents: Heighington, Reade & Johnston.\n[1] 3 Ex.

S. C. ch. 164, for unlawfully obtaining property, is good, though the prisoner, according to the evidence, might have been convicted of a criminal breach of trust under sec. 65.\nA fraudulent appropriation by the principal, and a fraudulent receiving by the accessory may take place at the same time and by the same act.\nTwo bills of indictment were presented against A. and B. under secs. 85 and 83 of the Larceny Act.\nBy the first count each was charged with having unlawfully and with intent to defraud, taken and appropriated to his own use $7,000-belonging to the heirs of C, so as to deprive them of their beneficiary interest in the same.\nThe second count charged B. (the appellant) with having unlawfully received the $70000, the property of the heirs which had before then been unlawfully obtained and taken and appropriated by said A., the taking and receiving being a misdemeanor under sec. 85, ch. 164 R. S. C. at the time when he so received the money. A. who was the executor of C.'s estate, and was the-custodian of the money, pleaded .guilty to the charge on the first count. 15. pleaded, not guilty, was acquitted of the charge on the-first count, but was found guilty of unlawfully receiving.

On the same evening he absconded to New York.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that whether A. be a bailee or trustee, and whether the unlawful appropriation by A. took place by the handing over of the money to B. or previously, B. was properly convicted under sec. 85 ch 164 R.S. C of receiving it, knowing it to have been unlawfully obtained. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) on an appeal from the decision of the trial judge refusing a motion for a \"reserved case\" after verdict ([1]).\nThe \"Reserved case\" submitted to the Court of Queen's Bench by Mr. Justice Wurtele the trial judge was as follows:\n\"The prisoner Alexander McIntosh was tried before me on two counts; by the first, for having unlawfully and with intent to defraud, taken and appropriated to his own use $7,000 belonging to the heirs Dalrymple so as to deprive them of their beneficiary interest in such sum; and, by the second for having received such sum from one James Dalrymple, who had so unlawfully and with intent to defraud the heirs Dalrymple taken and appropriated the same to his own use, so as to deprive them of their beneficiary interest therein, knowing the same to have been so unlawfully taken; and on the 14th September last (1893) he was acquitted on the first count and was found guilty on the second. After the rendering of the verdict, on the 20th September 1893 Mr. St. Pierre' Q. C, of counsel for the prisoner, moved:\n\" That inasmuch as, according to the evidence adduced on behalf of the crown the money, referred to was appropriated by one James Dalrymple, who was the proper keeper of that money, in his capacity of testamentary executor of the late James Dalrymple, and inasmuch as the act of appropriation by the said James Dalrymple only took place at the time when the money was handed over to the accused McIntosh, which act, to wit, that of handing over by Dalrymple and that of receiving by McIntosh formed but one single undivided act. \"\n\"the following point be therefore reserved for the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side; \"\n\"whether McIntosh could be rightfully convicted of the crime of feloniously receiving a certain sum of money knowing it to have been stolen.\"\n\"And that inasmuch as according to the same evidence the money referred to is alleged to be the undivided property of several heirs who have never apportioned their respective shares;\"\n\"the following point be reserved for the said Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side;\"\n\" whether the accused could be found guilty of feloniously receiving money, of which he was part owner for an undivided and indefinite share.\"\nI In my opinion, the evidence showed that one Arthur Brennan owed $5,375.00 to the heirs Dalrymple; that James Dalrymple, and the prisoner as the legatee of his wife had each a certain share of this money that all the interested parties crave Mr. Brennan an acquaintance, and agreed that James Dalrymple should receive the money from Mr. Brennan and divide it among them; that he did receive the amount on the the 19th November, 1887, but that instead of dividing it, he handed it over to the prisoner on the evening of the day on which he had received it together with other moneys coming from payments of interest belonging to the heirs, which he had previously received as executor, and which formed together a total sum of $7000.00 that after receiving the $5,375.00 from Mr. Brennan the prisoner went to the Windsor Hotel and bought a railway ticket for New York, taking for that purpose some of the money which he had received from Mr. Brennan and thereby breaking its bulk; that the prisoner had previously, on the 10th November, 1887 drawn from the Savings Bank, where he had deposited the moneys coming from interest, the sum which he added to the money received from Mr. Brennan and which formed with it the sum of $7,000.00; that it had been previously agreed between James Dalrymple and the prisoner that the former would fraudulently appropriate the money due by Mr. Brennan when it should be paid to him, and that he would abscond immediately afterwards, and that he drew the money from the Savings Bank with the intention of appropriating it and of absconding; that when he handed the money over to the prisoner he told him that it was the \"boodle\" and that on the evening of the 19th November 1887 James Dalrymple fled to the United States, and the prisoner went to the railway station to see him off.\"\n\" I was of opinion, as James Dalrymple, when he received the money from Mr. Brennan, as a bailee, intended to misappropriate it and to defraud his coheirs of their shares and had carried out that intent with the previous knowledge and connivance of the prisoner, that he had appropriated it to his own use, so as to depive them of their beneficiary interest in it before he had handed it to the prisoner that the fact of breaking the bulk and taking some of the money to buy the railway ticket constituted, a fraudulent a appropriation of the money and ended his relation to his co-heirs of bailee; that moreover the fact of drawing the money of the heirs which he had deposited in the Savings Bank, with the intention of appropriating it to himself and fleeing to the United States, also ended his relation to his co-heirs of bailee of that money and rendered him guilty of fraudulent appropriation; and that the prisoner knew, when the $7,000.00 were received by him, that they had been previously fraudulently taken and misappropriated; and I therefore declared that the first point was not well taken.\"\n\"I was also of opinion that under section 85 of the Larceny Act (ch. 164 of the Revised Statutes of Canada) James Dalrymple was rightfully indicted and convicted of having unlawfully taken the $7,000.00 as under that section any one, being one of several beneficiary owners of any money, who steals or unlawfully converts the same to his own use or to that of any other person is liable to be dealt with as if he had not been one of such beneficiary owners, and that as a consequence the prisoner was rightfully indicted and found guilty under section 83 of the same act for having received this money knowing it to have been unlawfully taken and misappropriated; and I therefore also declared that the second point was wrongly taken.\"\n\"I had no doubts on the two points and on the 23rd September last (1893) I consequently refused to reserve the two questions which the prisoner's counsel asked me to submit for the opinion of the Court of Appeal. The prisoner thereupon applied for leave to appeal from my ruling or decision, and on the 25th November last, (1893,) leave to appeal was granted.\" \" In conformity with paragraph 3 of section 744 of the Criminal Code, 1892, the present case is now stated by me; and I now submit for the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the two following questions, viz.:\"\n\" 1st. Whether, under the circumstances, the prisoner has been rightfully convicted of the crime of unlaw-fully receiving the sum of $7,000.00 from James Dalrymple, knowing it to have been previously unlawfully taken and misappropriated, inasmuch as James Dairymple was the bailee of such money and only parted with it when he handed to him.\"\n\" 2nd. Whether the prisoner could, be found guilty of unlawfully receiving money of which he was part owner for an undivided share inasmuch as the money was the undivided property of the heirs Dairymple, of whom he represented one.\"\nH. Saint Pierre Q. C. for appellant relied on and cited; The Queen v. Warner ([2]); The Queen v. Perkins ([3]); The Queen v. Smith ([4]); Russell on Crimes, by Greaves ([5]); Roscoe's Criminal Evidence ([6]); The Queen v. Berthiaume ([7]); The Queen v. St. Louis ([8]); Mooney v. The Queen ([9]).\nM. J, F. Quinn Q. C, for the respondent: Queen v. Ashwell ([10]); Queen v. Craddock ([11]); The Peopee v. Smith ([12]). Crankshaw on The Criminal Code art. 742.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J. Two questions were submitted to the Court of Appeal in Montreal in this case.\n1st. \" Whether the accused could be found guilty of feloniously receiving money from a person who had a legal right to the custody of that money but who had a felonious intent to the knowledge of the accused in intrusting the latter with said money;\"\n2nd \" Whether the accused .could be found guilty of feloniously receiving money of which he was part owner for an undivided and indefinite share.\"\nUpon the second question, the learned judges were unanimous in the opinion that under sec. 85 of the Larceny Act, applicable to this case, there was no doubt that the objection taken by the accused on the point therein mentioned was unfounded, and consequently, there being no dissent on that question, no appeal thereon lies to this court, and it has been abandoned at the hearing. Sec. '742 Criminal Code of 1892; Reg. v. Gunningham ([13]) The first question, therefore, one of the learned judges having dissented from the judgment against the accused, is the only one before us. It is loosely drawn; the terms \" feloniously and felonious intent \"are not felicitous expressions in relation to a misdemeanour. However we understand what the question means.\nThe facss of the case are as follows:\nDuring, the November term of the year 1892, two bills of indictment were presented by the Grand Jury one against James Dairymple and the other against McIntosh, both under sections 85 and 83 of the Larceny Act then in force. Both bills Were drafted in exactly the same terms. By the first count each was charged with having unlawfully and with intent to defraud taken and appropriated to his own use seven thousand dollars belonging to the heirs Dalrymple, so as to deprive them of their beneficiary interest in the same.\nThe second count was worded as follows: \" And the Jurors aforesaid upon their oath aforesaid, do further present that the said Alexander Mcintosh nineteenth day of November, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, at the City of Montreal in the District of Montreal, unlawfully did receive d certain sum of money to wit, the sum of seven thousand dollars, the property of Mary Dalrymple, Ellen Dairymple Caroline Dairymple and George Dalrymple which said sum of money, to wit, said sum of seven thousand dollars had before then been unlawfully obtained and taken and appropriated by one fames Dalrymple, the obtaining and the taking of which sum of money to wit of said sum of seven thousand dollars, by the said James Dairymple, as aforesaid, is made a misdemeanor in and by a virtue of section eighty-five, chapter one hundred and sixty-four of the Revised Statute of Canada, he (said Alexander McIntosh) at the time when he so received the said sum of money to wit, the said sum of seven thousand dollars, as aforesaid, well knowing the same to have been so unlawfully appropriated, obtained and taken by the said James Dalrymple as aforesaid.\"\nJames Dairymple pleaded guilty to the charge on the first count, and McIntosh was acquitted of the charge contained in the first count of the indictment, but was found guilty on the second, to wit, on the charge of receiving.\nThe prisoner's counsel thereupon moved for a revved case, which subsequently was heard before the Court of Appeal on the two question above mentioned.\nMr. Justice Wurtele, who presided at the trial, stated the case as follows: (His Lordship then read from the reserved case as already published and preceded as follows):\nThe fact that Dalrymple bought his railway ticket out of that money were it material, cannot be denied by the appellant here as he has attempted to do. The facts must be taken as stated by the learned judge who presided at the trial and cannot in any way be contradicted\nThe majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal held that Dairymple was not a bailee but a trustee; that as a trustee he was properly indicted under sec. 85; that Dalrymple's appropriation took place before he handed the money to appellant; that appellant was properly convicted of receiving; and that there was a fraudulent appropriation.\nThe learned Chief Justice, in a dissenting opinion, agrees that Dalrymple was guilty of fraudulent appropriation as a trustee, but that he ought to have been indicted under section 65; that he was not liable under section 85 that because he was not liable under section 85 the appellant could not be found guilty of the offence described in the indictment i e receiving money previously unlawfully obtained, taken and appropriated by the said James Dalrymple under circumstances which made such taking a misdemeanor under section 85; that consequently the offence has not been proved as charged.\nSection 85 of ch. 164 E. S. C. is in the following terms:\nEvery one who unlawfully and with intent to defraud by taking by embezzling, by obtaining by false pretenses, or in any other manner whatsoever, appropriates to his own use, or to the use of any other person, any property whatsoever, so as to deprive any other person temporarily or absolutely, of the advantage, use or enjoyment of any beneficial interest in such property in law or in equity, which such other person has therein, is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to be punished as in the case of simple larceny, and if the value of such property exceeds two hundred dollars the offender shall be liable to fourteen years imprisonment.\nSection 83 of the same act provides that .\nAny one who receives any money, valuable security, or other property whatsoever, the stealing, taking. obtaining, converting or disposing whereof, is made a misdemeanour, by this act, if he knows the same to have been unlawfully stolen, taken obtained converted and disposed of, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to seven years inmri-sonment. Were it not for the dissent of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, and of my brother Gwynne in this court, I would say that the appellant's contestations are altogether unfounded. He would argue, I understand, that because Dairymple might have been indicted under sec. 65 of the statute he could not be indicted under sec. 85. But why not if the facts proved constitute an offence under the latter section?\nWe have an express statutory enactment that if anyone is punishable under two or more statutes or two or more sections of the same statute he may be indicted under any of them. Sec. 933 Code (a re-enactment). The question arises then, whether under the facts proved in the case, Dalrymple was guilty of the misdemeanor created by sec 85.\nThere is no doubt but that McIntosh was not precluded by Dalrymple's conviction from proving that Dairymple was not guilty under sec. 85.\nWhen the principal has been previously convicted then the conviction is presumptive evidence that everything in the former proceeding was rightly and properly transacted, yet it is competent: to the receiver to controvert the guilt of the principal. ([14]) But the fraudulent appropriation by Dairymple is clearly established, and the facts proved fully support the finding of the jury against McIntosh. \"Whether Dalrymple was a bailee, or a trustee, or neither one nor the other is immaterial Every one, says this clause, never mind who he is, whether he has a right to the possession or not, or to legally hold or not, who unlawfully and with intent to defraud, etc. Now, here, the intent to defraud cannot be questioned; therefore, the possession of this money by McIntosh, however lawful it might have been, became unlawful by this preconceived plan of criminally appropriating it. And whether he might be said to have taken it or embezzled it or stolen it or obtained it by false pretenses is immaterial All of these fraudulent conversions are covered by this sec. 85 with the addition of \" in any other manner whatsoever.\" The fraudulent appropriation of the money so as to deprive the heirs Dalrymple of their beneficiary interest in it, cannot be, and is not denied by the appellant, but he bases on the facts proved a second objection to the conviction. He argues that even if Dairymple were guilty of fraudulent appropriation, it was only when he handed the $7000 to the appellant that he was guilty of any crime; that consequently the appellant, if guilty at all, was also guilty of fraudulent appropriation and cannot be indicted as a receiver; that he ought to have been found guilty of the fraudulent appropriation, or acquitted, and that the jury had no right to bring a verdict of guilty on the second count of the indictment for receiving On that point the judges in the court below were unanimous in holding the appellant's contention unfounded.\nThe facts that bear on this point, though appearing in the reserved case, may perhaps be recapitulated here.\nDairymple was appointed trustee or executor of two estates; one his father's the other his mother's.\nAs such trustee he had in his possession a sum of $1,812.82 which up to the month of November, 1887, was deposited in one of the banks in his own name. On 10th November, 1887, he drew this money out of the bank. On 15th November, 1887, having collected a certain sum due the estate by one Magnan, the heirs were called together and each received his portion of this sum. Dalrymple did not divide the $1,812.82 which he had drawn from the bank. There was a sum of $5,375.00 falling due, by one Brennan to the heirs a few days after the division of the Magnan money and the heirs granted a notarial discharge to Brennan and Dalrymple for this sum and gave a verbal authorization to Brennan to pay the money to Dairymple, and to Dalrymple to receive the money from Brennan. At the time of the division of the Magnan money, some of the heirs objected to the appellant receiving as large a share as he did. A disagreement arose and the appellant and Dalrymple walked home from the notary's office together. They then agreed to a scheme by which Dairymple should appropriate the money to be paid by Brennan and defraud the other heirs. Several interviews took place between the date of the division of the Magnan money and the receipt of the Brennan money by Dalrymple, and it was agreed between them, that when Dalrymple should receive this money he would hand it to appellant for safe keeping and abscond to the Untied States This arrangement was fully carried out. Brennan paid Dairymple $5,465.00 by check on 19th November, 1887. Dalrymple cashed the check; handed the difference between the amount due by Brennan, $5375000 and the amount of the check back to Brennan went to the Windsor Hotel; purchased a ticket for New York went home took the $1,812.82 and made up a parcel of $7,000.00 out of this and the balance of $5,375.00; took this parcel to appellant's store, as previously arranged, and handed it to him saying: \"Here is the boodle, take good care of it.\" On the same evening he absconded to New York.\nUpon this evidence, I am of opinion, with the court below, that there was a fraudulent appropriation by Dalrymple previous to his handing over the money to McIntosh.\n\"Whether the appropriation took place only at the very last second before he handed the boodle as he termed it, to McIntosh, or by any of his previous acts, it is immaterial. If it was then and there boodle the fraudulent appropriation had preceded. But, even if it could be said that the appropriation took place only by the handing over the money, that would be sufficient. The same act then constituted a fraudulent appropriation by Dairymple, and a fraudulent receiving by McIntosh. The case of Reg, v. Roberts ([15]) would appear to be an authority for the proposition that there was no fraudulent conversion by Dalrymple on the facts proved till he handed over the money to McInotsh so as to constitute larceny if the relation between them had been that of master and servant. But that case is based on the peculiar requisites of the conversion necessary at common law to constitute larceny, the doctrine whereof cannot be extended to the statutory offence provided for by sec. 85 of the Larceny Act.\nI think the conviction was right.\nAfter verdict the court is bound to resort to any possible construction which would uphold an indictment against a purely technical objection as was held in Reg v. Craddock ([16]) on a verdict for receiving when the accused had, as here, been found not guilty on two first counts for stealing. It is legal by an express statutory enactment to charge a stealing and a receiving in the same indictment. There is consequently no such repugnancy in the present case as was contended for by the appellant. Reg. v. Huntley ([17]) Where a prisoner is charged in two counts with stealing and receiving, the jury may return a verdict of guilty on the latter count if warranted by the evidence, although the evidence is also consistent with the prisoner having been a principal in the second degree in the stealing. Reg. v. Rilton ([18]). An indictment may charge the prisoner, in two counts, with being an accessory before the fact and accessory after the fact. Rex. v. Blackson ([19]).\nA person having a joint possession with the thief may be convicted as a receiver. Reg. v. Smith ([20]); Reg. v. Wiley ([21]) And in the same case, a conviction for a receiving is good, although a conviction for stealing would have been supported by the same evidence if the jury had so found\nDairymple might have been acquitted and yet McIntosh found guilty. And an accessory before the fact may also be a receiver. Reg v. Hughes ([22]); Beg. v. Pulham ([23]); Reg. v. Burton ([24]); though a principal cannot be. Beg. v. Coggins ([25]); except under the circumstances mentioned in Greavs's note to Reg. v Perkins ([26]) in 1st Russ. 53. And here, McIntosh though not a principal in the ordinary sense of the word, was an accessory before the fact, for it is settled law that, although an act be committed in pursuance of a previous concerted plan between the parties, those who are not present, or so near as to be able to afford aid and assistance at the time when the offence was committed, are not principals but accessories before the fact. Reg, v. Soares ([27]) Reg. v Davis ([28]); Reg. v. Else ([29]); Beg. v. Tuckwell ([30]). But as accessory before the fact he was liable to be indicted and punished as a principal. Rg.v. James ([31]).\nIn a note to Beg. v. Langmead ([32]), where the prisoner was found guilty of receiving only, though also charged with the larceny, Greaves says: A. clearer case of this there never was; the sheep were proved. to have been in possession of the son, and the prisoner received them; and there was abundant evidence of guilty knowledge, and it was perfectly immaterial whether the prisoner had previously stolen them for a man may be a thief and a receiver as well There was also evidence that he either stole, or was an accessory before the fact to the stealing.\nNow, here also, there is evidence that McIntosh was an accessory before the fact to the fraudulent appropriation, and therefore a principal, as in misdemeanors all are principals, and he was rightly charged as such in the first count of the indictment. But why was a verdict of guilty on the count for receiving not legal because the \"jury found him not guilty on the first count, as it was in Langmead's case, or Hughes' case, or the other cases above cited?\nHe cannot argue that he. became a principal only when he received the money; he was, in law, a principal before that.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the month of September, 1893, the appellant was convicted in the District of Montreal upon a count in an indictment which charged him as follows:\nAnd the Jurors aforesaid upon their oath aforesaid do further present: that the said Alexander Mcintosh on the nineteenth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty seven at the City of Montreal in the District of I Montreal unlawfully did receive a certain sum of money, to wit, the sum of seven thousand dollars, the property of Mary Dalrymple, Ellen Dalrymple, Caroline Dalrymple and George Dalrymple, which said sum of money, to wit, said sum of seven thousand dollars had before then been unlawfully obtained and taken and appropriated by one James Dalrymple, the obtaining and the taking of which, sum of money, to wit, of said sum of seven thousand dollars by the said James Dalrymple as aforesaid, is made a misdemeanour in and by virtue of section eighty five chapter one hundred and sixty four, of the Revised Statutes of Canada he (said Alexander McIntosh) at the time when he so received the said sum of money, to wit, the said sum of seven thousand dollars as aforesaid, well knowing the same to have been so unlawfully appropriated, obtained and taken by the said James Dalrymple as aforesaid.\"\nUpon the verdict of guilty upon the charge contained in this count being rendered, counsel for appellant applied for a reserved case upon certain points stated by him. His application was refused by the learned judge who tried the case, and thereupon application was made to the Attorney General, under sec. 744 of 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 29, for leave to appeal which having been granted, a case was stated to the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, Montreal, under the provisions of the third subsection of said sec. 744. The case so stated had appended thereto as part thereof the evidence upon which the verdict was rendered, and submitted for the opinion of the Court of Appeal the two following questions:\n\"1st. Whether, under the circumstances the prisoner has been rightfully convicted of the crime of unlawfully receiving the sum of $7,000 from James Dalrymple, knowing it to have been previously unlawfully taken and misappropriated, inasmuch as James Dalrymple was the bailee of such money and only parted with it when he handed it to him.\n2. Whether the prisoner could be found guilty of unlawfully receiving money of which he was part owner for an undivided share inasmuch as the money was the undivided property of the heirs Dalrymple of whom he represented one.\" The majority of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, the Chief Justice dissenting, were of opinion that the conviction was good and therefore affirmed it and dismissed the appeal. From that judgment the present appeal is taken.\nThe count upon which the appellant has been found guilty is plainly framed under sec. 83 of the Dominion act 49 Vie. ch. 164 namely that he had received from James Dalrymple the sum of, to wit, $7,000 which at the time of receiving it the appellant well knew that the said James Dalrymple had, pieviously to the appellant receiving the money from him, unlawfully appropriated taken and obtained. Now the moneys handed by Dairymple to the appellant were. received by James Dalrymple in his character of testamentary executor of an estate in which the said James Dalrymple and the appellant and others were jointly interested as part owners. The money was therefore lawfully obtained by James Dairymple and so long as it remained in his possession was there lawfully, whatever intention he may have entertained in virtue of a conspiracy with the appellant or otherwise to misappropriate it for what the law makes criminal is the act done in pursuance of the criminal intention, not the mere intention not followed by an act to carry such intention into effect.\nUntil, therefore, James Dalrymple parted in some manner with the money of which he was lawfully in possession the appellant could not be guilty of the offence with which he is charged of having received from Dalrvmple money which at the time of his receiving it he well knew that Dairymple had previously unlawfully obtained or appropriated. If the handing of the money to the appellant constituted the appropriation which made Dalrymple guilty of the offence which he is alleged in the count against the appellant to have committed, then the count against the appellant cannot be maintained for the offence committed by Dalrymple, with the knowledge of the previous committal of which the appellant is charged in the count, must be one which had been committed before ever Dalrymple handed the money to the appellant. However guilty the appellant may be under the evidence of some offence against the criminal law in the matter it is plainly not that charged in the count upon which he has been found guilty for there is no evidence of any misappropriation of the money handed by Dalrymple to the appellant until the money was so handed. Neither the pre-arranged agreement between Dalrvmple and the appellant as to the appropriation of the money to which Dalrymple has testified, nor his misappropriation, if any there was, of other money belonging, to the estate of which he was such testamentary executor, can be of any consequence upon a count which charges that the appellant received the money which he did receive from Dairymple well knowing that Dairymple had previously unlawfully appropriated, obtained or taken it.\nI am of opinion, that the evidence fails wholly to establish such charge, and therefore that this appeal must be allowed and that the conviction must be quashed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : H.

The company was to keep the roadway between the rails and for eighteen inches outside each rail paved and macadamised and in good repair using the same material as that on the remainder of the street, but if a permanent pavement should be adopted by the corporation the company was not bound to construct a like pavement between the rails, etc., but was only to pay the cost price of the same, not to exceed a specified sum per yard.\nThe City corporation laid upon certain streets traversed by the company\u2019s railway permanent pavements of cedar blocks, and issued debentures for the whole cost of such works. A by-law was then passed, charging the company with its portion of such cost in the manner and for the period that adjacent owners were assessed under the Municipal Act for local improvements. The company paid the several rates assessed up to the year 1886, but refused to pay for subsequent years on the ground that the cedar block pavement had proved to be by no means permanent but defective and wholly insufficient for streets upon which the railway was operated. An action having been brought by the city for these rates, it was held that the Company was only liable to pay for permanent roadways and a reference was ordered to determine, among other things, whether or not the pavements laid by the city were permanent. This reference was not proceeded with but an agreement was entered into by which all matters in dispute to the end of the year 1888 were settled, and thereafter the company was to pay a specific sum annually per mile in lieu of all claims on account of debentures maturing after that date, and \u201cin lieu of the company\u2019s liability for construction, renewal, maintenance and repair in respect of all the portions of streets occupied by the company\u2019s track so long as the franchise of the company to use the said streets now extends.\u201d The agreement provided that it was not to affect the rights of either party in respect to the arbitration to be had if the city took over the railway, nor any matters not specifically dealt with therein, and it was not to have any operation \u201cbeyond the period over which the aforesaid franchise now extends.\u201d\nThis agreement was ratified by an act of the legislature passed in 1890, which also provided for the holding of the said arbitration which having been entered upon the city claimed to be paid the rates imposed upon the company for construction of permanent pavements for which debentures had been issued payable after the termination of the franchise. The arbitrators having refused to allow this claim an action was brought by the city to recover the said amount.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the claim of the city could not be allowed; that the said agreement discharged the company from all liability in respect to construction, renewal, maintenance and repair of the said streets; and that the clause providing that the agreement should not affect the rights of the parties in respect to the arbitration. etc., must be considered to have been inserted ex majori cautela and could not do away with the express contract to relieve the company from liability.\nHeld further, that by an act passed in 1877, and a by-law made in pursuance thereof, the company was only assessed as for local improvements which, by the Municipal Act constitute a lien upon the property assessed but not a personal liability upon owners or occupiers after they have ceased to be such; therefore after the termination of the franchise the company would not be liable for these rates.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, by an equal division, the judgment at the trial for the defendants.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Gwynne, as follows:\u2014\nUpon the 26th of March, 1861, the plaintiffs entered into an agreement with one Alexander Easton, for the construction of street railways in the City of Toronto, and for the maintenance and operation thereof for the period of thirty years from the said 26th March, 1861, upon certain terms and conditions therein mentioned, the only ones of which necessary to be set out here are the 3rd, 17th, 18th and 20th.\nIt was provided by the 3rd that the roadway between, and within at least one foot six inches on each side of the rails should be paved or macadamised and kept constantly in good repair by the said Easton, who should also be bound to construct and keep in good repair crossings of a similar character to those adopted by the corporation at the intersection of every railway track and cross streets. By the 17th, that should the proprietors neglect to keep the track or the roadway, or the crossings between and on each side of the rails, in good condition, or to have the necessary repairs made thereon, the city surveyor or other proper officer should give notice thereof requiring such repairs to be made forthwith, and if not made within a reasonable time the said surveyor or other officer as aforesaid should cause the repairs to be made, and the amount so expended might be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nBy the 18th\u2014That the privilege granted by the agreement should extend over the period of 30 years from the date of the agreement, but that at the expiration thereof the corporation might, after giving six months notice prior to the expiration of the said term of their intention, assume the ownership of the railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, on payment of their value, to be determined by arbitration, and that in case the Corporation should fail in exercising the right of assuming the ownership of the said railway at the ex- piration of 30 years as aforesaid, they might at the expiration of every five years to elapse after the first 30 years, exercise the same right of assuming the ownership of the said railway, and of all real and personal estate thereunto appertaining, after one year\u2019s notice to be given within the twelve months immediately preceding every fifth year as aforesaid, and payment of their value to be determined by arbitration. By the 20th\u2014that the agreement should only have effect after the legislation necessary for legalizing the same should have been obtained.\nBy an act of the legislature of the late province of Canada passed on the 18th May, 1861, 24 Vic. ch. 83, the said Alexander Easton and others were incorporated as \u201cThe Toronto Street Railway Company,\u201d and thereby the said agreement of the 26th March, 1861, was ratified and confirmed and held to be valid and binding upon the said city of Toronto and the Toronto Street Railway Company. The company having become insolvent a new company by the same name and subject to all the obligations imposed upon the former company by the said agreement with the city and by the said act, 24 Vic. ch. 83, was incorporated in the place and stead of the former company by a statute of the Ontario legislature, 36 Vic. ch. 101, passed on the 29th March, 1873. By another act of the same legislature passed on the 2nd March, 1877, 40 Vic. ch. 85, it was enacted as follows, among other things:\n1. That the said Toronto Street Railway Company should be bound to construct, renew, maintain and keep in good order and repair, the roadway between the rails, and one foot and six inches outside of each rail, using for that purpose the same material and mode of construction as that which should from time to time be adopted and used for the remaining portion of the street by the corporation. Provided, that where the corporation of the city of Toronto should adopt and use in any street or portion of street traversed by the railway a permanent pavement of wood, stone, asphalt or other material of the like permanent character, the said Street Railway Company should not in such case be bound to construct the same or to pay more than the cost price of such pavement over the space between their rails and for one foot six inches outside of each rail, and as against the said company, that such price should not, in any case, exceed the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per square yard.\n4. That in every case of construction or renewal of any kind of permanent pavement upon any of the streets occupied by the said Street Railway Company, the said company should have the option of constructing their portion of any such pavement, or at their request the said corporation of the city of Toronto should construct the same and that in every such case the corporation should assess an annual rate, (covering interest and sinking fund extending over the like period as that upon which the. assessment upon the adjacent ratepayers is adjusted) upon the said company for the cost thereof not exceeding the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per square yard with full power to the said corporation to raise such sum by an issue of debentures and to collect the same in the manner provided under the Municipal Act for the construction of local improvements.\n5. That if the corporation should at any time elect to assume the said street under the provisions of the agreement and by-law in that behalf, the arbitrators appointed to determine the value of the real and personal property of the said company should also estimate, as an asset of the Company, the value to the said company of any permanent pavement thereafter constructed or paid for by the said company for the balance of the life of the said pavement.\nIn the year 1882, and subsequent years up to and inclusive of 1888, the corporation constructed upon some of the streets of the city which were traversed by the company\u2019s railway cedar block pavements or roadways as and for permanent pavements and, at the request of the company, constructed their part under the provisions of the above statute, and they issued debentures to cover the cost of the whole of the said respective works, and passed by-laws whereby they charged to the company, under the provisions of the said statute, that portion of such respective works, payable by annual instalments or assessments, covering cost, interest and sinking fund in the same manner and for the like period as adjacent ratepayers were charged, rated and assessed for the said respective works under the provisions of the Municipal Act for the construction of local improvements; the rates charged for their several works were spread over periods varying from eight to twenty years. In the year 1884, the City of Toronto procured another act to be passed upon their petition by the Ontario Legislature, 47 Vic. ch. 59, whereby it was, among other things, enacted that;\n\u201cIn the case of the Toronto Street Railway Company or any other body corporate, who may be assessable under any general or special act for the payment of the cost of any portion of any work, improvement or service otherwise than in respect of real property fronting or abutting on any street benefitted by such improvement, work or service the said company or body corporate, as the case may be, shall be assessable respectively at their head office, either in one sum for their share of the costs of the work or improvement, or in case the cost of the work is payable in instalments, then for such per annum, for the term of years within which the other portions of such debt are made payable as will be sufficient to pay off the amount of the debt created on the security of their assessment, together with interest at the same rate per annum as is chargeable and payable in respect of the other portions of the debt, and such assessment shall constitute a lien and charge upon any real estate owned by or belonging to the said company or body corporate.\u201d\nOn the 7th June, 1886, the corporation of the city passed a by-law entitled:\n\u201cA by-law to provide for an issue of five per cent ten year local improvement debentures, being the proportion to be borne by the Toronto Street Railway Company of the cost of construction of cedar block roads on certain streets herein named, and for rating the said Toronto Street Railway Company therefore.\u201d\nThe by-law then recites six several by-laws passed by the city during 1885, for raising by the issue of local improvement debentures, payable at the expiration of ten years from the date of issue of the same, the amount for which the railway company is said to be liable amounting in the whole to $24,258.07; it then recites the above provisions extracted from 40 Vic. ch. 85, and 47 Vic. ch. 59. It then recites that the corporation of the city had at the request of the Toronto Street Railway Company constructed their portion of the said pavements on the several streets mentioned in the by-law, the aggregate cost of the same amounting to the sum of $24,258.07, and that it was necessary, pursuant to the said recited acts in that behalf, to make provision for the issue of debentures, and for the raising annually, by a rate to be levied on the Toronto Street Railway Company, the sum required to be provided for the payment of the interest on said debentures during their currency, and for their payment at maturity. The by-law then enacts: 1st. That the sum of twenty-four thousand two hundred and fifty-three dollars and seven cents be raised by loan by this corporation at the security of the special rate hereby imposed and that the debt so to be created is further guaranteed by the Municipality at large and that the debentures amounting to the said sum be issued by the corporation therefor.\n2nd. That during ten years the currency of the debentures to be issued under the authority of this by-law the sum of $1,212.05 shall be raised annually for the payment of interest and the said debentures and also the sum of $1,940.25, shall be raised annually for the payment of the debt making in all the sum of $3,152.90 to be raised annually as aforesaid, and that an annual rate and assessments therefor is hereby imposed on the Toronto Street Railway Company over and above all other rates and assessments which sum shall be annually inserted on the collectors local improvements tax rolls for, and be collected at the head office of, the said Toronto Street Railway Company in the ward of St. James or any other ward in which said office may be from time to time located, in each year for the next succeeding ten years and shall be payable to and collected by them in the same way as other rates on the said rolls.\nThis by-law was produced for the purpose of showing the manner in-which the Railway Company were charged, assessed and rated by the City for the several works constructed by the City and charged to the Railway Company as the party chargeable therefor under the above statutes. The first of the rates charged by such by-laws or any of them became due under the by-laws in that behalf in the year 1883; the company paid the City the amount of rate imposed as payable in that year, so did they likewise the rates imposed as payable respectively in the years 1884-5 and 6. Upon the ground that, as they contended, as early in the said year 1886 the cedar block roadway adopted by the corporation proved itself to be wholly defective and by no means permanent and wholly inapplicable to and insufficient for the purposes of streets upon which the company were operating their lines of street railway tracks, and that in addition to such defect in the material of the roadway the corporation were guilty of gross negligence in the manner in which they laid the cedar blocks and constructed the roadways upon which the company operated the railways, they contended that they were not only relieved from all liability purported to be imposed upon them by the said by-law but that the corporation were liable to them for damages sustained by reason of the insufficiency of such cedar blocks as a roadway and the alleged negligent manner in which they were laid, and the company refused to pay any further sums so charged and rated against them or for any repairs the necessity for which was occasioned by such insufficiency of the roadway.\u2014In consequence of such refusal the corporation of the City brought an action against the company in the month of December, 1886, and in their statement of claim in such action filed in the month of January, 1887, they claimed the sum of $6,000 for monies alleged to have been expended by them in the years 1882-83-84-85 and 86 in making repairs on streets traversed by the company\u2019s lines of railway between the rails and for eighteen inches outside of each rail in consequence of the alleged neglect of the company to make such repairs after notice contrary, as was contended, to the provisions of the statutes in that behalf, also for damages alleged to have been paid by the city to persons alleged to have suffered injury by reason of such alleged neglect of the company. To this statement of claim the company pleaded by way of defence that for the reasons above stated they were not at all liable to be charged for the construction and repair of roadways which, as they insisted, were not permanent roadways, but on the contrary were wholly defective and inadequate for the purpose for which they were constructed not only by the insufficiency and defect of the material used but also by the negligent mode of construction; and they denied all liability under the statutes to the City for the damages alleged to have been sustained by them by reason of the alleged neglect of the company or otherwise, and on the contrary they claimed by way of counter claim $10,000 as damages sustained by them by reason of the wholly defective character of the roadway as adopted and constructed by the City. Judgment was rendered in this action by the High Court of Justice for Ontario on the 20th day of December 1888, whereby the court did declare and adjudge as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. That the defendant company is bound to keep in repair such permanent pavements as the plaintiff corporation may have laid upon the streets used by the defendants for the purpose of its traffic, over the space between the tracks, and for eighteen inches outside the same.\u201c\n\u201c2. That the defendant company is liable to pay to the plaintiff such damages as it may have suffered or paid by reason of the non-repair by the defendant of such permanent pavements aforesaid over the space aforesaid.\u201d\n\u201c3. That the plaintiffs were and are bound to use reasonable care, skill and diligences in selecting pavements to be laid as permanent pavements over the space aforesaid, and over the remainder of the said streets, so far only as the pavements upon the said space has been or is affected thereby; and if negligent in such selection, the defendant is not liable to pay for such construction or to repair as for a permanent pavement; and if such reasonable care, skill and diligence in such selection was not exercised by the plaintiff corporation, it is liable to the defendant for any losses caused by such negligence.\u201d\n\u201c4. That the plaintiff was and is bound to use reasonable care and skill in the construction of such permanent pavements on the streets aforesaid, and on the remainder of the said streets, so far only as the pavement on the space aforsaid has been, or is affected thereby; AND if such pavements were so negligently constructed as not to be permanent, the defendant is not liable to pay for such construction or to repair, and the plaintiff was and is liable in such case to the defendant for any losses caused by such negligence.\u201d\n\u201c5. And this court doth further order and direct that it be referred to Edmund John Senkler, Esquire, of the City of St. Catharines, under subsection one of sec. 101 of the Judicature Act to inquire and report.\u201d\n\u201c(1). Whether the plaintiff corporation has laid permanent pavements upon the streets occupied by the defendant company, due regard being had to the occupation of the streets by the company and otherwise, and to all and every other matter or cause affecting the said pavements, and entering into the consideration of the question of their permanence.\u201d\n\u201c(2). As to the cost of the repairs made by the plaintiffs to permanent pavements on the streets occupied by the defendant company.\u201d\n\u201c(3). The loss or damage which has been suffered or paid by the plaintiff for or by reason of the neglect of the defendants to repair such portions of said streets.\u201d\n\u201c(4). Whether the plaintiff has been negligent in selecting pavements as permanent on streets occupied by the defendants, and if so, the loss or damage, if any, sustained by the defendants from such negligence.\u201d\n\u201c(5). Whether the plaintiff has been negligent in constructing the aforesaid pavements, and if so the loss or damage, if any, sustained by the defendants from such negligence.\u201d\n\u201c(6). And this court doth further order that on this motion for judgment, all questions of law or fact arising upon the pleadings or report of the said referee, and not determined by the court on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th findings of the court as aforesaid, shall be open for argument, and that this declaration shall not be construed as restricting or taking away from the parties any rights reserved or given to them by subsection one of section 101, or the practice thereunder, but shall be construed as adding to or enlarging such rights, if those given by this order are not reserved or given by said subsection.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs neither appealed from this order nor did they take steps to procure the inquires and report by the said order directed to be taken and made; but instead thereof negotiations for a settlement of the differences between the parties were entered into for the purpose of settling by arbitration or mutual agreement the several matters of difference in the said action and in other actions which appear also to have been pending between the parties, which negotiations terminated in an agreement by way of compromise being executed by and between the parties under their respective common seals upon and bearing date the 19th day of January, 1889, by which it was among other things mutually covenanted as follows:\n\u201cAll matters in issue in the several actions which were pending between the city and the company on Dec. 31st, 1888, and all claims made therein by the company upon the city and vice vers\u00e2 up to said date are hereby settled upon the following basis:\u201d \u201c1. The company is to pay the city forthwith the amount of the company\u2019s debenture account for 1887 ($17,095.36) with interest at five per cent from December 31st, 1887 and for 1888 ($22,378.56) with interest at five per cent from September 10th, 1888, to date of payment.\u201d\n\u201c2. From December 31st, 1888, the company is to pay the city, in lieu of all claims on account of debentures maturing after that date, and in lieu of the company\u2019s liability for construction\u2014renewal\u2014maintenance\u2014and repair in respect of all the portions of streets occupied by the company\u2019s tracks at the rate of $600.00 per mile of single track (or $1,200 per mile of double track), per annum, so long as the franchise of the company to use the said streets or any of them now extends, such sum to be paid quarterly on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st in each year, in respect of the three months immediately preceding the said dates respectively, the first of such quarterly payments to be made on the first of April, 1889, and if there be a broken quarter, then at the same rate for such broken quarter on the last day thereof.\u201d\n\u201c(4). The said payments shall be accepted by the city in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims upon the company in respect of the construction\u2014renewal\u2014maintenance\u2014and repair, of all the aforesaid portions of said streets; and also in respect of all claims by the city upon the company for damages and costs suffered or paid by the city by reason of the non\u2011construction or non-repair thereof by the company; and hereafter the city shall undertake the construction\u2014renewal\u2014maintenance and repair of all the aforesaid portions of said streets, but not of the company\u2019s tracks, ties and stringers.\u201d\n\u201c(5). As between the company and the city, the city shall have the sole right in every case from time to time to determine the kind of road bed or beds, pavement or pavements, if any, to be laid down, constructed or maintained upon the said streets or upon the portions thereof occupied or used by the company, and the manner in which the same shall be constructed; and the liability of the city to the company in respect of the renewal, repair and maintenance of roads shall be as defined by sec. 531 of the Municipal Act save that the city shall be bound to indemnify the company against any damages or costs which the company may have to pay to third parties by reason exclusively of neglect on the part of the city to repair or to keep in repair the portions of the streets aforesaid.\u201d\nSection 10 makes provision for the case of the city authorizing the construction of new lines of track upon any of the streets already traversed by the railway of the company. Then:\n\u201c(11). This agreement is not to affect the rights of either party in respect of any of the matters referred to in the 18th resolution set out in by-law 353 of the city of Toronto or of any question arising out of the same nor in respect of any matter not herein specifically dealt with, nor shall this agreement have any operation beyond the period over which the aforesaid franchise now extends.\u201d\n\u201c(12). In consideration of the foregoing it is further agreed that all claims by the city against the company in respect of construction,\u2014or renewal of roadways\u2014 repairs of roadways\u2014and damages by reason of non-repair thereof, up to the date of this agreement shall be abandoned and that all actions pending on the 31st December, 1888, between the city and company shall be forthwith dismissed by the respective plaintiffs.\u201d\nThis agreement was ratified and confirmed by an act of the Ontario Legislature passed on the 7th April, 1890, 53 Vic. ch. 105, and all acts and parts of acts of the legislature inconsistent therewith were thereby repealed. By that act it was further enacted that:\n\u201cThe corporation of the city of Toronto may at once proceed to arbitrate under the 18th resolution recited in the agreement of the 26th March, 1861, printed as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto and the said city of Toronto and the Toronto Street Railway Company shall in every reasonable way facilitate such arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitrators to be named shall proceed, so as if possible to make the award not later than the 13th March, 1891. If from any cause the award shall not be made by such time, or if either party be dissatisfied with such award, the said corporation of the city of Toronto shall nevertheless be at liberty to take possession of the said Toronto Street Railway and all the property and effects thereof real and personal on paying into court either the amount of such award if the award be made, or if not upon paying into court or to the company such sum of money as upon notice given to the said Toronto Street Railway Company a divisional Court of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice may order, and upon and subject and according to such terms stipulations and conditions as the said Divisional Court shall in every such order direct or prescribe; provided always that this section shall not be construed to affect the rights of the parties in any way under the said agreement save as herein provided.\u201d\nThe arbitration was subsequently entered into under the terms and provisions of the said 18th resolution of the agreement of the 26th March, 1861. Upon the arbitration, the city corporation presented a claim by way of reduction of the amount to be allowed to the company as and for the value of their real and personal property being arbitrated upon the sum of $146,000 as the cash value of the several annual instalments to become pay- able in the years ensuing the termination of the company\u2019s franchise, as declared and enacted by the said several by-laws of the City Council charging, rating, and assessing the company with their proportion of the cost of the construction of roadways, for which the corporation had issued debentures as aforesaid. Against this claim of the city the company produced the said agreement of the 19th January, 1889, confirmed by the act of the legislature above recited, insisting that it operated as a release of all right and claim, if any, the corporation had to enforce payment of such instalments. The arbitrators were of opinion that the agreement did operate as such release. They rejected the claim of the city, and made their award, whereby they awarded, adjudged and determined the value of the railways of the said Toronto Street Railway Company, and of all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, to be the sum of one million four hundred and fifty-three thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars, subject however to the following incumbrances, amounting in the whole to the principal sum of six hundred and forty thousand two hundred dollars, that is to say: Debentures issued by the Toronto Street Railway Company under the authority of the act of the Ontario legislature, 47 Vic. ch. 77, for the principal sum of six hundred thousand dollars, payable on the 1st of July, 1914, bearing interest at six per cent per annum, also mortgages set out in the award for the principal sum of forty thousand two hundred dollars with interest thereon.\nIn the month of September, 1891, the city corporation instituted the present action against the defendants for the purpose of asserting their right to recover, independently of the said award, and notwithstanding the refusal of the said arbitrators to enter- tain the said claim of the plaintiffs to be allowed the said sum of $146,000, the several rates by the said by-law of the city imposed upon and declared to be payable by the defendants in the several years subsequent to the termination of the franchise, until the payment of the debentures issued to cover the amounts so charged upon the defendants should be fully paid, and in their statement of claim they allege that although the defendants had duly paid or accounted to the plaintiff for the rates which so became due and payable to the plaintiffs, prior to the year 1891, they refused to pay the sum of $22,266.30, which they allege had since became due in respect of the said rates, and they pray for a declaration that the defendants are liable to pay the said rates so declared to be, and made, payable subsequently to the termination of the defendant\u2019s franchise, and an order for payment of the said sum of $22,260.30, and interest from the 26th day of August, 1891. To this action the defendants have pleaded by way of defence the said agreement of the 19th January, 1889, and the judgment rendered in December, 1888, in the action then pending between the city and the company, and insisted that the said agreement operated as a release of all liability of the defendants in respect of all rates which by the said by-laws were declared to be and and were made payable subsequently to the 26th March, 1891. They also pleaded the said arbitration and the claim thereby of the plaintiffs of the said sum of $146,000, and the disallowance thereof by the arbitrators and their award, and insisted that the award operated as a bar of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this action. By way of alternative defence they pleaded like matters to the matters of fact alleged by them in their defence to the action instituted by the plaintiffs against them, which was pending when the said agreement of the 19th Jan., 1889, was entered into, upon which they relied in case they should fail upon their other grounds of defence above stated. Upon the trial before Mr. Justice Falconbridge, that learned judge was of opinion that the said agreement of the 19th January, 1889, did operate as such release as was contended for by the defendants and accordingly the said action was, by his judgment affirmed by the judgment of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, dismissed with costs. Upon appeal from this judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the court was divided, and the appeal was therefore dismissed. The Chief Justice of the court entirely concurred with the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge, declaring himself to be of opinion that the agreement of 19th January, 1889, was a final settlement of all matters between the parties as to pavements, roadway, costs of construction and repairs, and of everything in dispute relating thereto, or to money claims for or against each party, past, present or future, and he proceeded to give his reasons for entertaining this opinion.\nMr. Justice Osler also concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbrige, and was also of opinion that the plaintiffs having acquired the ownership of the defendants\u2019 railway, and of all their real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, in respect of which ownership alone the local improvement assessments in question were imposed, the defendants\u2019 liability in respect of such assessments then came to an end, and the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover in respect of any assessments falling due under the terms of the by-laws after such roadway and property were so acquired by them.\nMr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Maclennan were of a contrary opinion. Hence the appeal to this court. Robinson Q.C., and S.H. Blake Q.C. for the appellants.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(His Lordship stated the facts as above set out and proceeded as follows:\u2014\nIn the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of Mr. Justice Osler I entirely concur. It cannot be doubted that the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose in the action instituted in 1887 by the city against the company was favourable to the contention of the company as set out in their statement of defence to that action in so far that, if the matters of fact directed to be inquired into should have been found in favour of the company, would they not only have been freed from liability for the rates imposed, (and not paid), or to be imposed for the construction of the streets as constructed by the city, or for their maintenance and repair as constructed, but would possibly have recovered the amounts then already paid by them for such rates, and other damages which they alleged they had suffered by what they insisted was the default and neglect of the city corporation. Instead of the plaintiffs in that action proceeding with the reference and inquiries directed for the purpose of determining the facts necessary for the final adjudication in the action the parties agreed upon terms which can be regarded in no other light than that of a compromise of their respective contentions, but if the contention of the plaintiffs in the present action should prevail the defendants, instead of agreeing with the plaintiff upon a compromise of their respective contentions, must be held to have, in substance and effect, surrendered every point for which they had contended, and to have submitted to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention as if every fact had been concluded against the defendants upon the reference and inquiries directed. Now the agreement of January, 1889, provides that:\nAll matters in difference between the city and the company on December 31st, 1888, and all claims made therein by the company on the city and vice vers\u00e2, up to said date, are hereby settled upon the following basis:\u2014\n1. The company is to pay the city forthwith the amount of the company\u2019s debenture account for 1887, ($17,095.96), with interest at five per cent. from December, 31st, 1887, and for 1888, ($22,373.56), with interest at five per cent from September 10th, 1888, to date of payment.\n2. From December 31st, 1888, the company is to pay the city, in lieu of all claims on account of debentures maturing after that date, and in lieu of the company\u2019s liability for construction\u2014renewal\u2014maintenance and repair in respect of all the portions of streets occupied by the company\u2019s tracks at the rate of $600 per mile, single track, or $1200 per mile, double track, per annum, so long as the franchise of the company to use the said streets or any of them extends.\n4. The said payments shall be accepted by the city in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims upon the company in respect of construction, renewal, maintenance and repair of all the aforesaid portions of the said streets; and also in respect of all claims by the city upon the company for damages and costs suffered or paid by the city by reason of the non-construction or non-repair thereof by the company, and hereafter the city shall undertake the construction, renewal, maintenance and repairs of the aforesaid portions of the said streets, but not of the company\u2019s tracks, ties and stringers.\nNow the company\u2019s debenture accounts, above referred to, the instalment claimed in respect of which by the city for the years 1887 and 1888 the company agreed to pay, were the aggregate amounts of the principal sums and interest declared to be charged upon the company by the city by-laws in that behalf for which the city had issued debentures to raise the money expended in construction of the cedar block roadways, which the company insisted were by no means permanent roadways and that therefore they were not at all liable therefor. By payment of the instalments of such debenture accounts made payable in the years 1883, \u201884, \u201885, \u201886, \u201887 and \u201888, the company satisfied and discharged all the liability, if any, there was imposed upon them in respect of the said \u201cdebenture accounts\u201d up to the 31st December 1888. Then the 2nd paragraph of the agreement provides that the company shall, after the said 31st December 1888, so long as their franchise to use the said streets now extends (in the very words of this paragraph), pay to the city the annual sums therein mentioned in lieu of all claims of the city on account of debentures maturing after the 31st December 1888 and in lieu of the company\u2019s liability for construction, renewal, maintenance and repair, and by the 4th paragraph the city covenants, and their covenant is ratified by act of Parliament, to accept such annual sums in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims upon the company in respect of the construction\u2014 renewal, maintenance and repair of all the aforesaid portion of the said streets, &c., &c.\nNow the words in the 2nd paragraph \u201cin lieu of all claims on account of debentures maturing after that date\u201d (the 31st December 1888) and the words \u201cin lieu of the company\u2019s liability for construction\u201d &c., &c., plainly relate to the liability of the company in respect of all debentures then already issued for streets upon which the cedar block pavements had been constructed, and in fact the language according to its natural and ordinary meaning covers the whole of the company\u2019s liability for construction of cedar block roadways then already constructed or thereafter to be constructed by the city. So the acceptance in the 4th paragraph by the city of the said sums by the said 1st and 2nd paragraphs agreed to be paid, when paid, in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims upon the company in respect of construction &c., plainly relates to the same liability spoken of in the 2nd paragraph, of the defendants to pay for the construction of the cedar block pavements then constructed, that is to say the total debt charged by the by-law upon the company for the construction of such streets and by such by-law made to be a debitum in presenti although payable in futuro by annual instalments and charged as a lien upon the company\u2019s railway and other property. The plain and natural construction of these paragraphs, taking them together unaffected by any other paragraphs in the agreement, is that the company are discharged from all liability in respect of any debentures maturing after the 31st December 1888 at any time on account of construction, renewals, &c., of the roadways in streets traversed by the company\u2019s railway tracks, and from all liability in respect of such construction in the past, and the city expressly covenants to undertake and bear in the future the whole cost of construction\u2014renewal\u2014maintenance and repair of all the portions of the streets which as they had contended the company were liable for, except the company\u2019s tracks, ties and stringers, which alone the company are themselves to construct, maintain and repair. So construed the compromise of the contentions of the respectives parties and the reasonableness of it in the state of the facts as existing when the agreement was entered into is apparent, namely, the company abandon their claim of exemption from liability for cost of construction by reason of the defect of the cedar block pavement adopted by the city, and of its want of permanency and of the negligence of the city in the manner of \u201cconstruction;\u201d and they agree to pay and bear the instalments remaining unpaid for the first six years imposed by the terms of the by-law in that behalf, and to pay the annual sums mentioned in paragraph 2, in lieu of all further liability whatever as to construction, renewal &c., and the city in consideration of such payments agree to accept them in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims against the company for construction &c., of cedar block pave- ments on the streets wherein they had then already been constructed and they undertake for the future to take upon themselves the burthen of construction renewal &c., &c., which they up to then contended that the company were liable for. Upon these terms of mutual concession the parties respectively agree to abandon their respective claims as theretofore asserted. The plaintiffs however contend that the 2nd paragraph is to be read as if the words.\n\u201cso long as the franchise of the company to use the said streets or any of them now extend,\u201d should be read as if inserted after the words maturing after that date, thus: \u201cFrom December 31st, 1818, the company is to pay the city, in lieu of all claims, on account of debentures after that date, so long as the franchise of the company to use the said streets or any of them now extends, &c., &c.\u201d\nThe paragraphs 2 and 4 read together, apart from all other paragraphs, leave no room in my opinion for such a construction, but it is argued upon behalf of the city, that read in connection with paragraph 11 that is the true construction, but in this contention I cannot concur. The necessity for the insertion of paragraph 11 is not very apparent, it seems to have been unnecessarily introduced, ex majori cautel\u00e2 of an over cautious draftsman. It\u2019s first sentence appears to provide against the agreement being construed to affect the rights of either party under the 18th paragraph of the agreement of March, 1861, entitling the city to terminate the company\u2019s franchise at the expiration of 30 years from date, and providing in such case for an arbitration; but there does not seem to be anything in the agreement which could have been construed to affect such rights if the 11th paragraph had not been inserted.\nThe second sentence provides that the agreement shall not be construed to affect the rights of either party in respect of any matter not therein specially dealt with. How it could if the 11th clause had not been inserted it is difficult to say; moreover upon the question whether or not a particular matter has been specifically dealt with must be determined apart from the 11th paragraph, in other words that paragraph cannot unsettle a matter specifically dealt with apart from that paragraph. The question here is whether the liability of the defendants for instalments charged by the by laws to mature after the expiration of the company\u2019s franchise has been specifically dealt with apart from the 11th paragraph; that paragraph therefore cannot be appealed to upon that question, and that such liability has been specifically dealt with and satisfied, and discharged by the provisions contained in paragraphs 2 and 4 appears to me to be clear; then the last sentence of the paragraph appears to have been inserted for the purpose of placing beyond all doubt, that the agreement as to the annual payments by the company, and the undertaking of the company to bear the burthen of future construction, renewal, &c., &c., should not extend beyond the 26th March, 1891, in case the company should not then terminate the franchise of the company, but should suffer it to continue for a longer period under the terms of the agreement of March, 1861; that provision could not possibly have the effect any more than the previous sentence to unsettle a matter specifically settled apart from the 11th paragraph.\nThen again, as to the question involved in the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler, upon what principle can the contention of the plaintiffs be entertained apart from the agreement of January, 1889? By the act of 1877, in virtue of which the several by-laws were passed charging the company with a share of the cost of construction of the cedar block pavements under which by-laws the present claim is asserted, the corporation is made liable only in the same manner as is provided under the Municipal Act for the construction of local improvements; now the cost of the construction of local improvements is charged as a lien upon the real property benefited by or charged by the by-laws for the construction thereof for a portion of the construction of such improvement and the annual instalments to cover principal, interest and sinking fund to redeem the debentures issued for such works as are made chargeable upon, and payable by the owner and occupant of the property upon which the cost of construction is charged as a lien, but, after the persons or person who were or was owners or owner of the real property charged with such lien, have or has ceased to be owners or occupants, owner or occupant, such persons or person never have been held to be or supposed to be personally liable for instalments maturing after they ceased to be such owners or occupants although the lien upon the property still remains, and the subsequent owners and occupants for the time being become liable therefor. Now in the present case the company are no longer owners or occupants of the railways in question; they were transferred by them to the city after the city terminated their franchise, and the debentures issued for construction of the roadways became, in so far as the amount chargeable and charged upon the company as for their portion of the cost of the construction, a lien upon the property so transferred to the company. If then the company after ceasing to be owners or occupants of the railway and real property which the company had while its franchise lasted, should be held liable for the instalments accruing under the by-laws in respect of such cost of construction after the company\u2019s franchise had determined, and after they had ceased to be owners or occupants of the said railways and real property, they would be liable upon a princi- ple not provided by the Municipal Act in respect of the liability of persons charged, rated and assessed in respect of local improvements. Then it was argued that it must be held, that upon the arbitration the defendants were allowed for the value of the roadways to them, to the full amount of the proportion of the cost of construction which by the by-laws were charged, rated and assessed upon them by the city, and that, therefore, they must be liable for the rates maturing as payable after the termination of their franchise. But in making such an allowance, if any such was made to the defendants by the arbitrators, they would have erred, in my opinion, and such error, if committed, could not now be rectified by holding the present action to be maintainable. By the act 40 Vic. ch. 85, the arbitrators were bound to estimate as an asset of the company any permanent pavements or roadways thereafter constructed by the company only to the value of such permanent roadways to the company and for the balance only of the life of such pavement. In the settlement of January, 1889, the contention of the company was, that the roadways as they were constructed by the city were not permanent, and were of no value to the company, and that, therefore, they were not liable for any part of the cost of construction thereof, although charged therewith by the by-laws in that behalf. It was upon this contention that the company entered into the compromise contained in the agreement of January, 1889, which the arbitrators construed to be, as it was contended by the defendants to be, a release and discharge of the company, by the city, from all future liability under those by-laws, for construction, &c. Upon the compromise having been executed and payment by the company of the instalments made payable by the by-laws in the first six years, the company might possibly have been regarded on the arbitration as entitled to an allowance for any value to the company of such roadways, so far as such outlay was concerned, but the compromise having been entered into by the company, upon the contention that the roadways as constructed by the city were of no value to the company, it is not likely that the arbitrators, construing the agreement of January, 1889, as they did, would have allowed anything even for such outlay, but however that may be, the question raised now by the plaintiffs is not, whether they did or did not make any allowance in respect of such outlay, but whether they allowed anything to the company for the value to them of roads which the company never did construct, but which were constructed by the city, and the company\u2019s liability to pay any portion of the construction of which the company had disputed upon the ground that they were not permanent, and were of no value to them, and in support of their contention of exemption from which liability accruing subsequently to the date of the compromise agreement they produced and relied upon that agreement. I can see no ground for the contention that the arbitrators did make any such allowance. If they did it could not now make any difference, nor in any manner alter the construction which in this action we are bound to put upon the agreement of January, 1889.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs in all the courts, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.R.W.

S. Q. arts. 4153, 4154, 4155\u2014Straight tine.\nWhere there is a dispute as to the boundary line between two lots granted by patents from the crown, and it has been found impossible to identify the original line but two certain points have been recorded in the Crown Lands Department, the proper course is to run a straight line between the two certain points. R. S. Q. art. 4155.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action en bornage taken in the superior Court for the District of Arthabaska, on the 9th day of February, 1889, to establish the boundary between that part of the lot 27 in the sixth range in the Town ship of Thetford, which joins the south-east half of the lot number 27 in the fifth range of the same town ship the defendants, appellants, being the proprietors of the latter lot, and the plaintiffs, respondents, of the former.\nThe defendants pleaded the general issue.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment of the court.\nDuring the trial surveyor experts were appointed by the parties in the case to visit the locality, but they did not agree as to the line of the original survey.\nOn the 30th November, 1891, the court at Arthabaska ordered the bornage to be made according to the pretensions of the respondents, that is to say: by following the direct line between the two nearest points recognized by both parties, and condemned the appellants to pay the costs of the action, and the costs of the bornage to. be borne in common by the two parties.\nThe surveyor, Ashe, was appointed by the court to carry out this judgment and to draw a line of division between the two lots. This was done and on the 9th February, 1892, the court homologated the report of the surveyor, and condemned the defendants to pay $7,145 in damages for the value of the asbestos which they had taken from that part of the property which the court decided to belong to the respondents.\nStuart Q.C. and A. Hurd for appellants.\nIrvine Q.C. and J. Lavergne for respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The litigation in this case originated by an ordinary action en bornage, with a claim for damages. The parties are proprietors of contiguous lots in the township of Thetford, which are divided by the concession line between the fifth and sixth ranges of the said township, and the controversy is as to the situs of that line. The respondents contend that the said line should be a straight one from the corner of lots 25 and 26 in the fifth range of Thetford, to the corner of Coleraine, Thetford and Ireland \u00b0 this is the line marked \"DB\" on the plans in the record This contention has prevailed in the two courts below. The appellants contend that the straight line \"DB\" is not correct, but that a line called the Legendre line should be the boundary between their property and the respondents' s that whether this Legendre line, as traced in 1878, was then erroneous or not cannot affect this case, as the respondents got their title after that, and that title is based on that line, whether straight or angular.\nThe line in question, which is in the range or concession line between the fifth and sixth ranges of Thetford, was originally run in the year 1800 by one Jeremiah McCarthy. His report and field notes have been produced in this case which show the bearings on which the line was run, and also show it to be a straight line. After a lapse of a number of years, during which time no settlements were made in this part of the township, the property began to become valuable for the asbestos mines which were then being discovered. It became necessary then to arrange the lines in some satisfactory way. In the particular neighborhood where the lots belonging to the parties are situated fires had passed over the line and destroyed pickets and other marks indicating the original survey. In 1878 Mr. J. B. O. Legendre, surveyor, was instructed to retrace this line. By his report he claims to have passed over the original line run by McCarthy, and in consequence the result was a straight line. Upon this last survey grants were made of lot no. 27 in the sixth range and 27 in the fifth range, to the persons from whom the parties in the case hold title.\nIn 1882 judgment was rendered ordering a side line to be run between lots 26 and 27 in the fifth range. The suit was in the case of King v. Hayden, Hayden then being proprietor of the lot now belonging to the appellants. This survey, made under order of the court, was done by Legendre, the same above mentioned, and one Towle. The respondents had no inter est whatever in this line and had no notice that a sur vey was to be made. In making this survey the sur. veyors, being unable to find the post dividing the lots 26 and 27 of the fifth range, professed to retrace the 15\u00bd survey made by Legendre four years before. On the day following one of the shareholders of the Johnson's Co., being on the ground, noticed this retraced line and perceived that it was not what he considered the original line and called the attention of Legendre to it, and he re-measured the line and retraced it marking the place with iron bolts. This second operation, he says, indicates, as nearly as he could show it, the line run by him in 1878. He says that it is the exact line or very near it.\nIt is this operation of Towle and Legendre which has give rise to all the trouble the parties have had in this case.\nA very large amount of evidence has been given tending to show where the original Legendre line was run. it has been shown by a number of people that Legendre has given conflicting statements as to where this line was and all the evidence which has been taken on one side or the other has been to show whether or not the line run by Legendre can now be found with certainty.\nThe law regulating these matters is to be found in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, articles 4153, 4154, 4155 as follows\n4153. Whenever it happens that the posts or boundary marks between any lot or range of lots have been effaced, removed or lost, the Land Surveyor is hereby authorized to administer the oath to witnesses and to examine them for the purpose of ascertaining the former boundaries. 45 V. c. 16 s. 71.\n4154. If such former boundaries cannot be ascertained such Land Surveyor shall measure the true distance between the nearest undisputed posts, limits or boundaries, and divide such distance into such number of lots as the same space contained in the original survey,. giving to each a breadth proportionate to that intended in the original survey as shown on the plan and field notes thereof of record in the office of the Commissioner of Crown Lands 45 V. c 16 s. 71.\n4155. If any part of any outside line, central line, concession or range line intended in the original survey to be straight has been obliterated or lost the Land Surveyor then runs a straight line between the two nearest points or places where such line can be clearly and satisfactorily ascertained and plants such intermediate posts or boundaries as he may be required to plant in the line so ascertained, and the limits of each lot so found are the true limits thereof. 45 V. c 16 s 72\nThe contention of the appellants is that there are three certain points established on the line drawn by Legendre in 1878; one is a birch tree between lots 25 and 26, the other is the point \" K\" were a bolt was planted at the time of the survey made by Towle and Legendre, and the third is the post marking the division between the townships of Ireland, Thetford and Coleraine.\nThis would make a deviation from a straight line and an angle at the point \"K.\"\nThe plaintiffs, respondents, contend that \" K \" has not been identified as being a point on Legendre's line and that the only two certain points are the birch tree and the Ireland post, and that a straight line should be run between these two points which is the view of the case adopted by the courts below.\nIt is clearly explained that the idea of placing the bolt at \" K \" arose from the fact that there was a tree near that place upon which there was a blaze. Legendre in the most positive way swears that the blaze on this tree was not made by him and in no way indicated his line\nThe witness O'Neil explained that this blaze on the tree near the point \"K\" was made whilst he was going over the line for the purpose of identification previous to its being patented to Robert G. Ward and it was not made by him and was on the line as he located it\nThe whole case as to the exact position of the line made by Legendre is extremely uncertain and the attempt to identify it with the line claimed by the appellants has entirely failed. The only course to adopt was to follow the straight line between the two certain points as originally drawn by McCarthy in 1800, as was done by both judgments of the courts below.\nAgain, the patents of both parties were granted on what was supposed to be a straight line and which was recorded as such in the Crown Lands Department in the reports and field notes of the surveyors, Mc Carthy and Legendre.\nThis gives the respondents a right to have a straight line, and even if Legendre on his survey through error deviated from the straight line, they are, nevertheless, entitled to have one. The point \" K \" which forms the corner or angle and is the point in the line claimed by the appellants which extends furthest into the property of the respondents is eighteen feet from the straight line.\nNow whilst there is it is true no such law as that a division line between two properties should be straight one, yet, under the circumstances in this case, the onus probandi was, it seems to me, clearly on the appellants to establish such an anomaly as they contend for. And were I to pass on the case, in first instance, I would say that they have failed to do so. The Superior Court appointed two surveyors to report on the contentions of the parties. These gentlemen could not agree and filed separate reports. The Superior Court adopted that one of them which supports the straight line and the respondents' views, Ashe's report. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed that judgment. The appellants would now have us set aside those judgments and Ashe's report, and adopt the other expert's conclusions. He has failed to convince me on what ground we could do this. I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Hurd & Fraser.\nSolicitors for respondents : Laurier, Lavergne & Cot\u00e9.\n"}

Fournier J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court, ordering the appellants to pay into court $6,420.75, as interest on a sum of $30,555.00 deposited by the appellants on the 24th July 1888 under section 170 of the Railway Act, 1888. The material facts in question are as follows:\u2014 The appellants expropriated a piece of property belonging to the respondent and by award rendered on the 17th July, 1888, the arbitrators appointed under the act awarded to the respondent the sum of $30,575 as compensation for the land taken and damages. On the 24th July, 1888, appellants tendered this amount, together with a deed of sale of the property, to the respondent, who refused the tender on the ground that he intended to appeal from the award of the arbitrators. Thereupon, on the same day, the appellants applied to the Superior Court, under section 162 of the Railway Act, for a warrant of possession, depositing the amount of the award together with six months' interest there on, as required by section 170, in all the sum of $31,492. The respondent appealed from the award and the litigation consequent thereon continued until a judgment was rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench, at Montreal, on the 24th January 1891 which confirmed the award of the arbitrators. The respondent appealed to this court where his appeal was quashed for want of jurisdiction; he, however, obtained leave to appeal to Her Majesty in her Privy Council, but finally discontinued this appeal on the 16th November, 1891. On the 14th December, 1891, the respondent by petition to the Superior Court, prayed that the appellants be ordered to pay into the hands of the prothonotary of the Superior Court a sum \u00e9quivalent to six per cent on the capital amount of $30,575, from the 17th January, 1889, until such time as the capital and interest should have been fully distributed, and, further that they should be enjoined and ordered to proceed to confirmation of title in order to the distribution of the money. The court by judgment of the 28th January, 1892, ordered the payment of the sum of $6,420.75, being interest from the 24th January 1889, up to six months from the 24th January 1892, reserving to the respondent the right to apply for a further deposit should the moneys not be distributed within such delay and further ordered appellants to proceed forthwith to the confirmation of title and distribution of the moneys, but at the cost and charges of the respondent, and in default authorized the respondent to do so at his own expense.\nH. Abbott Q.C. for appellants contended, 1st, that the court of first instance had jurisdiction to render the judgment complained of; that the question of additional interest ould only he dealt with when the judgment of confirmation was obtained under sec. 172 of the Railway Act, and\n2nd. That it was through no error, fault or neglect of the appellants that a judgment of confirmation of title was not obtained within the six months hut it was entirely due to the acts of the respondent in refusing to accept and appealing from the award of the arbitrators, the amount of which was tendered to them. The learned counsel referred to sees 162 170 and 172 of The Railway Act.\nBranchaud Q.C. for respondent: As to the question of jurisdiction, there is nothing in the statute regulating this matter that prevents the Superior Court from granting such an order as the one that has been made in the present case. The petition also concluded that the appellants be ordered to proceed to the confirmation of title in order to effect the distribution \u00e0 qui de droit of the moneys deposited; and that, in their default to do so within the delay fixed by the court, the respondent be authorized to take the means indicated by the statute for the distribution of these moneys.\nBy adopting the mode of payment indicated in section 170 of the Railway Act, the appellants became bound to follow all the requirements of the section, in order to free themselves from the payment of any further interest. The money as thus deposited became locked up entirely under the control of the appellants, the respondent being left powerless to take possession of this amount awarded to him while he was dispossessed of his property. The taking possession of the expropriated land subjected the appellants to payment of interest on the amount of the award until the same should have been fully paid, just as the purchaser of a property susceptible of producing civil fruits is bound to pay interest on the unpaid price from the time of entering into possession of it.\nThis section 170 clearly shows that the appellants were bound to proceed forthwith in the confirmation of title, in order that the award be paid \u00e0 qui de droit. Though it is not stated in the section 170 by whom the proceedings in confirmation of title should be taken, yet under the common law a proprietor alone can exercise\" th\u00e1t right. The appellants were, in consequence of the deposit of the amount of compensation and of the award itself in the hands of the prothonotary, proprietors of the land expropriated, the award taking the place of the title but more than that section 172 of the same Railway Act imposes beyond doubt upon the appellants the obligation of taking the necessary proceedings to obtain the confirmation of title required by section 170.\nH. Abbott Q.C., in reply, cited art. 1162 C.C., and Ex parte Hart. ([1])\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The respondent was expropriated by the appellants under the provisions of the Railway Act of 1888.\nOn the 17th July, 1888, the majority of the arbitrators awarded to the respondent, as compensation for the damages sustained by him in consequence of such expropriation, the sum of $30575.\nOn the 20th July, 1888, the appellants tendered to the respondent the amount of the award, but it was not acted upon as they never renewed it, nor deposited the money in court so as to enable the respondent to get it when he wished to do so. Art. 1162, C.C.\nIn order to avail themselves of this tender the appellants should, with their petition for a warrant of possession, have deposited the amount. They, on the contrary, preferred to adopt the \"mode indicated in sec. 170 which concerns matters in expropriation for the province of Quebec, under the Railway Act. On the 24th July, 1888, they deposited with the prothonotary the sum of $30,575, the amount of the award, together with the sum of $917255 for six months' interest in advance, as required by this section and obtained a writ of possession to enable them to take possession of the expropriated land.\nBy adopting the mode of payment indicated by this section the appellants were obliged to conform to all its requirements in order to free themselves from the payment of any interest in the future. The money so deposited remained entirely under the control of the appellants, and the respondent was powerless to get possession of the amount awarded to him while he was dispossessed of his property.\nUnder sec. 170 the appellant company by taking proceedings in confirmation of title, were the Dominus litis, and it was upon them to proceed to judgment with the least possible delay. Moreover they alone, as proprietors, had the right to take those proceedings. And it is upon the party who makes the deposit that the obligation rests of taking the proceedings in confirmation of title. After regulating the manner in which the deposit is to be made, the section goes on \" and proceedings shall thereupon be had for the confirmation of title.\" It is not, therefore, upon the respondent, the ex-proprietor, that this obligation is laid, but upon the party making the deposit a and proceedings shall there- upon be had &c, &c.\" Moreover, sec. 172 declares that if the judgment of confirmation is obtained in less than six months from the date of the payment of the compensation to the prothonotary, the court shall direct a proportionate part of the interest to be returned to the company. And if, by the fault, negligence or error of the company, the judgment is not obtained until after the expiration of the six months, the court shall order the company to deposit the interest for such further period as is right. It is also clear from that section that it is the party demanding the judgment in confirmation of title who must take proceedings to obtain it If he obtains it within the six months it is to him that the difference in interest will revert but if, on the other hand, by his fault or neglect, it is not obtained until after the six months have expired then he will have to pay the surplus interest\nSec 172 is as follows:\u2014\nThat if the judgment of confirmation is obtained in less than six months from the payment of the compensation to the prothonotary, the court shall direct a proportionate part of the interest to be returned to the company, and if, from any error, fault or neglect of the company it is not obtained until after the six months have expired the court shall order the company to pay the prothonotary the interest 'for such further period as is right.\nThe respondent could not take proceedings for confirmation of title. The only parties who can be accused of neglect are the appellants, because upon them rested the obligation to proceed. They have taken no such proceedings, and the money which they deposited is still in the hands of the prothonotary, and the appellants have been ever since in possession of the property expropriated.\nTrue, the appellants contend the contrary, and say that there was neither fault, error nor neglect on their part to justify the order to make a second deposit, and that, if they have not taken proceedings to obtain a judgment in confirmation of title it was the fault of the respondent, who refused the offer made to him of the amount of the award. wow, the respondent did refuse this offer but gives as a reason that he wished to appeal from that award, the amount of which he considered quite insufficient. In consequence he appealed to the Superior Court, and obtained a judgment increasing the award to $52,000. On a further appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the present appellants, the amount of that judgment was reduced again to $30,575. The appellants now contend that they were again prevented from proceeding by the respondent's appeal to this court and to the Privy Council. They contend that during all these proceedings, and up to the time of the presentation of the petition for an order to have a further sum deposited, they were prevented from proceeding for the confirmation of title and could not be considered guilty of negligence.\nThe question is, therefore, reduced to this: Which of the two parties was to blame for not proceeding to the confirmation of title during the proceedings above mentioned? I have already said that the obligation rests upon the prosecuting party. The appellants, therefore, and not the respondent, must be declared in fault. Was the respondent to renounce his right of appeal in order to allow the appellants to proceed? His action was sufficiently important that he succeeded in getting the amount of the award increased from $30,575 to $52000. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench subsequently reduced the award to the original amount. But is he then to blame if he sought to have this judgment annulled by the Supreme Court? Certainly not; he had an indisputable right which he ought not to sacrifice.\nIt is to be observed that the confirmation of title mentioned in sec. 170 was not added in order to give a greater right to the property expropriated, because the deposit of the award and of the amount of compensation made by the appellants gave them a perfect title to the property. This confirmation of title is only for the purpose of purging the hypothecs which might affect the property.\nThe appellants have taken no proceedings for the confirmation of the title. The money is still in the hands of the prothonotary, and the property is in the possession of the appellants, and has been so ever since they first took possession. They have always had control over both the price and the property.\nThen, again, the appellants seek to excuse their negligence on the ground that the appeal to the Superior Court taken by the respondent against the award prevented their so proceeding. But this ground is futile, inasmuch as that appeal was entirely independent of, and distinct from, the proceedings taken by the appellants for the deposit of the amount of the compensation and interest to enable them to take possession of the expropriated lands. These proceedings form separate and distinct issues, bearing different numbers in the records of the court.\nThe appellants having a perfect title under the award at no time could have had less to pay than the amount fixed by it.\nThen, being in possession of the property the respondent's appeal could not prevent their proceeding to the distribution of the money under sec. 170. By adopting this course the appellants (even if the respondent had succeeded in having the amount increased to $52,- 000) would have been discharged in proportion to the amount of the award. In that case the appellants would only have had to pay the difference between the amount distributed and the amount ordered by the Court of Queen's Bench if the appeal were maintained. They have contended that the Superior Court in the present action had no jurisdiction to order a second deposit of interest if the first was exhausted \"before the -termination of the proceedings in confirmation of title but that the Court which heard the case in confirmation of title alone had such jurisdiction. But the Railway Act does not make this distinction and the jurisdiction is not defined or limited by the incidents which may be submitted. It is a court specially created by the Railway Act for the purpose of deciding any actions which may be brought under that act, and this is made very clear by sections 170 172 and several others as well as by the definition of the word \"Court\" given in the 2nd section of the act. \" The expression ' the Court' means a Superior Court of the province or district \"; therefore the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec is clearly designated as the court having jurisdiction by virtue of this act.\nThe respondent's appeal to the Superior Court could not hinder the appellants proceeding in confirmation of title, as required by section 170, any more than the procedure on the appeal could delay or prevent a judgment of confirmation. The two actions were distinct and separate, and had each a special object in view. There was no incompatibility between them, nor any reason which could prevent the two actions from being brought to judgment.\nAt the most the appellants would have been caused some slight inconvenience; should the judgment of confirmation be obtained before judgment was given on the appeal, and the judgment of the Superior Court, which had increased the award to $52000 had then been confirmed, it would only have been necessary to deposit the amount of the original award and then proceed to a second distribution. But the appellants could easily have avoided this inconvenience by obtaining an order from the Superior Court suspending the proceedings in confirmation until judgment on the appeal should have been rendered. The court would probably have granted them a short delay, while, as it is, several years have passed and no proceedings have been taken. As I have already said the company could easily have proceeded to the confirmation of their title and to the distribution of the amount deposited. Their position could only have been affected by an obligation to deposit the amount adjudged in excess of the award. It is not a rare occurrence in the Superior Court that several distributions are made of the monies arising Out of a sale of immoveables sold by the sheriff; often the distribution is only partly made by the court, and the party to whom the surplus belongs may appeal. An order of the court is sufficient to give to a party what is not contested, and admitted to be due whilst the party who is forced into a contestation retains the right to have the judgment on appeal reversed. That might have been done in this case without the least inconvenience.\nFor all these reasons, I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be maintained, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. In my view of this case there is error in the judgment appealed from by which the appellants were ordered to pay into court over $6,000 as interest on the amount of an award deposited by them into court under sec. 170 of the Railway Act of 1888,\nThe facts of the case are not in dispute and are not complicated: The arbitrators appointed under the act on an expropriation by the company of the respondent's land awarded him $30,575. Upon tender, the respondent refused that sum, and appealed to the Superior Court where he succeeded in getting the award increased to $52,000, but on appeal by the company to the Court of Queen's Bench the arbitrators' award was restored. Thereupon the respondent took proceedings for a further appeal but abandoned them on the 16th November 1891.\nPreviously, immediately upon the refusal by the respondent of the amount tendered, the company had obtained possession, upon depositing the said amount with six months' interest, under secs. 162 and 170 of the act. Two months after the end of the proceedings on the appeals above mentioned, the respondent petitioned the Superior Court for an order upon the appellant to deposit the interest upon the amount in court accrued since the expiration of the six months after the deposit. The Superior Court granted the prayer of that petition, the Court of Queen's Bench confirmed that judgment, and the appellants now complain of that condemnation.\nI fail to see that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to at all entertain that petition. It seems to me by the terms of sec. 172 of the act that it is only by the judgment of confirmation that this question of interest can be adjudicated upon.\nBut, assuming that the respondent's petition was before the proper tribunal, where is the error fault or neglect of the company that caused this confirmation of title not to be obtained? I cannot see any. It may be that strictly speaking, they might have initiated the necessary proceedings for that purpose notwithstanding the respondent's appeal from the award. But the court would then certainly have ordered a suspension of those proceedings till a final determination of the controversy as to the amount of that award. The judgment appealed from says that the company should have proceeded to the distribution of the money deposited. I cannot see that such a course could have been pursued before the amount to be distributed was determined and that could not be determined before the appeals on the award had themselves been completely determined. The respondent says that the company has the possession of this property, and consequently should pay this interest which represents the revenues of the property. But that is forgetting that the company has duly paid for that property all what it had to pay. If the respondent loses the interest on that payment it is his own fault, and not through any error, fault or neglect of the company that I can see. He must now be taken to have been wrong in not accepting the tender made to him, and is the cause, the only cause, of his loss in the matter. According to his contentions, his moneys were safely deposited at six per cent interest during all the time he felt inclined to exercise his litigious inclinations, unfounded though they have been held to have been. He is in error He cannot get interest when it is because he refused the amount tendered to him that he did not touch his capital. His refusal lasted during all his proceedings on appeal. It was a persistent daily refusal of the sum tendered to him till he dropped his appeal to the Privy Council; and yet he would now contend that it is through the neglect of the company that he was all that time deprived of his moneys.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and dismiss his petition with costs.\nAs to the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, of January, 1891, we have here nothing to do with it.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondent : Judah, Branchaud & Kavanagh.\n[1] 3 L.C.

He claimed $1,532.68, balance of an account for goods and merchandise sold to, work done for, money loaned to board furnished to and rent of tools and vehicles leased by Louis Pare and due to respondent and 3rd he claimed the sum of $327155 for expenses of last illness and funeral of Louis Pare board and lodging for him and care of his horses after his death.\nThe appellants pleaded.\n1. The deed of mortgage conferred no right of action on respondent as it was given solely as collateral security for a promissory note of a like amount. That the deed of mortgage did not effect novation and that the original debt was prescribed by the lapse of five years. 2. The respondent never advanced any money to Louis Pare. Louis Pare always paid for any goods he may have purchased from respondent. No agreement existed between Louis Pare and respondent, whereby he undertook to pay for tools and vehicles, or for board and lodging. These were furnished, if at all, gratuitously. Any payment of debts of the succession were paid by respondent with moneys of the succession The respondent cannot claim for the care of the horses after Louis Par\u00e9's death, because he made use of them for his own purposes, and diminished their value by bad treatment.\nFor the three years preceding his death, Louis Pare had a contract with the Federal Government to furnish stone to the penitentiary at St. Vincent de Paul. From this contract he received about $5000 per annum, or a total for the three years of $15,000.\nGeoffrion Q.C., for appellant, cited and referred to arts. 1171, 1169, 2247, 2264 and 2:227 C. C.

Dagenais ([6]); arts. 2184, 2185 C. C. Pothier Obligations ([7]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014The parties in this cause are the legal representatives of one Louis Pare, who died intestate in 1886.\nJoseph, the respondent, plaintiff in the cause by his action instituted shortly after Louis' death, claims from the appellants their shares, amounting to $3,869, of a claim, amounting to $4,220.93, which he, the respondent, alleges he had against Louis at his death, composed of three different sums, as follows '.\u2014\n1. $2,361.10, due by the deceased as per a notarial deed of obligation and constitution d'hypoth\u00e8que consented by him to plaintiff, respondent, on the 9th February, 1866, twenty years before his death.\n2. $1,532.88, balance of an account between plaintiff, respondent, and the deceased, for moneys advanced, goods sold and delivered, board, rent of tools, etc.\n3. $327.15, for last illness and funeral expenses paid by plaintiff, respondent.\nTo the first item the appellants have pleaded, besides the general issue, an exception as follows: They first deny that the plaintiff has any action On the notarial deed of 1866, alleged in the declaration, because this deed, as appears on its face, was only passed to give him a security for an antecedent unpaid promissory note of 1863 that Louis had made in his favour; that the said deed constituted no novation and no new debt, and can at most, be considered as having interrupted the prescription of five years against the said promissory note of 1863, by which interruption, according to (Art, 2264 C.C.) a new five years prescription began to run from that date, if the note was then due: that the said promissory note, dated twenty-four years before this action was brought, was due and payable more than five years before the institution of the present action, and that consequently it is extinguished by prescription. By a special replication there is no general one) the plaintiff answers that plea of prescription, not by denying at all that five years had elapsed since this debt was due, as alleged by the defendant, and consequently admitting it, (art. 144 C. P. 0.) but by saying that the deed of 1866 constituted a new debt, which said new debt was prescribed only by thirty years '. that the old debt on the promissory note of 1863, was extinguished by that deed of 1866, and replaced by a new one, one based on a notarial deed; that any prescription that might have accrued was interrupted at various times by admissions and payments by Louis himself in his life time.\nOn the issue so joined between the parties on this part of the action, I am of opinion that the plaintiff's action as to this first item entirely fails. This deed of 1866 is certainly not a novation of the promissory note of 1863; it does not purport to be so on its face. It is a mere security given for it. It reads thus:\u2014\n\"Lequel par ces pr\u00e9sentes, dit et d\u00e9clare que par et en vertu d'un certain billet sous seing priv\u00e9, en date du quatre novembre mil huit cent soixante-trois, qu'il a consenti \u00e0 Joseph Pare et \u00e0 d\u00e9funt Pierre Par\u00e9 ses fr\u00e8res alors marchands, du m\u00eame lieu, aux droits duquels Pierre Par\u00e9, le dit Joseph Par\u00e9, marchand de St Vincent de Paul susdit se trouve subrog\u00e9: ii doit au dit Joseph Pare la somme de cinq cent quatre vingt-dix livres, cinq chelins et six deniers du cours actuel avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le taux de sept par cent par an; le tout payable comme et de la mani\u00e8re expliqu\u00e9e au dit billet\n\"Et pour assurer au dit Joseph Pare ici pr\u00e9sent et acceptant le payement de la dite somme de cinq cent quatre-vingt-dix livres, cinq chelins et six deniers du dit cours avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats, le dit Louis Pare a soumis, affect\u00e9, oblige et hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9, un emplacement de forme triangulaire.\" etc.\nThat is all that this deed contains. The promissory note of 1863, was evidently not thereby paid or extinguished. So much so that Joseph, the respondent, kept it and has it to the present day in his possession, or what is. the same thing, in the possession of his attorney ad litem in this case, to whom it was handed for the purposes of this litigation. If, as he now contends this note had become extinguished by that deed, it would then and there have been given over to Louis That deed, it is true, contains an implied promise to pay, but to pay what? Clearly, the debt on the promissory note of 1863, not. a new debt at all, not a new obligation, and purports to merely give security for a pre-existing debt which was to remain unaltered and payable on the same terms and conditions. It contains no express promise to pay, but refers to the note as a subsisting instrument for the terms and conditions of payment. It simply admits the debt of 1863, and gives security for it. There is in it no intention to novate that I can see, in fact, novation is incompatible with its terms taken in connection with the all import ant fact that the respondent retained the note. The subrogation of the respondent alone as payee to himself and Pierre jointly if that could affect at all the question, is not done by the deed, but is treated as having previously taken place.\nAnd did not the respondent have a right of action on the note, notwithstanding this deed? The affirmative is not doubtful it seems to me. Then if the first debt was not extinguished there was no novation. Art? 1169 1171 CO.; and if there was no novation art. 2264 C.C. decrees in express terms that a deed in such a case is nothing else but an interruption of the prescription, and a renunciation to the benefit of the time up to then elapsed, so as to prolong it for five years more if the note was then overdue.\nThis article 2264 of the Quebec Code is not happily worded. In fact the necessity for it is doubtful, and it might have been better not to enact it, as has been done in the French Code; any act, deed or document which operates as a novation of a debt, evidently an not be called an interruption of prescription. It extinguishes the debt altogether, and thereafter, the only prescription that can apply is necessarily the prescription provided by law for the new debt. But if there has been no novation, any act, (fait) deed or document by which the prescription is voluntarily interrupted is nothing but a renunciation of the benefit of the time till then elapsed by which the prescription had begun to run: arts. 2184, 2222, 2227, J.0.; but the debt remains altogether the same and of the same character and consequently subject to the same prescription as before, which prescription then begins to run a fresh from the date of the interruption; the same debt, the same prescription, except that the time thus far elapsed does not count. That is what art. 2264 of the Quebec Code purports to decree and that is the law in France without such an express article. The contrary doctrine that a prescription of a debt say of five years should be extended to thirty years by an acknowledgment of it could not and did not prevail, though seemingly at various times it found a few supporters. The Court of Cassation in 1878, in a case of Bourgade v. Bourgade ([8]) and the Court of Appeal at Rouen in a recent case of Duquesnay in 1891, held that a short prescription when interrupted recommences for the same term not for thirty years. A case of Augier ([9]) and one of Spr\u00e9afico, ([10]) follows the same doctrine. I refer also to Dalloz ([11]) and to a case of Carpentier, ([12]) where one of the consid\u00e9rants of the Court of Cassation says on the question of prescription of promissory notas: \" attendu que la reconnaissance par un acte s\u00e9par\u00e9 (required in France by art. 189 of the Code du commerce) devant avoir pour effet de substituer \u00e0 la prescription quinquennale la prescription de trente ans ne peut r\u00e9sulter que d'un titre nouveau \u00e9manant du d\u00e9biteur et op\u00e9rant novation. \" In 1855, the Court of Paris had held in the same sense. \"qu'il faut un acte ayant pour but de faire novation \u00e0 l'obligation primitive pour substituer la prescription de trente ans \u00e0 la prescription quinquennale. Re Philippon ([13]). A note by Villeneuve to the case re Cabri\u00e9 ([14]) fully resumes the discussion on that point. The Dict. du droit contentieux, par Devilleneuve et Masse ([15]) et seq. and the recent work of Bravard-Veyri\u00e8res as annotated by D\u00e9mange\u00e2t Droit Commun ([16]), may also be usefully referred to. on the subject.\nIf there is no novation the interruption of prescription of a promissory note\" says B\u00e9darride (2) dr. Comm. No. 749) has no other effect but to render the debt subject to prescription by five years from the date of the interruption. I refer also to Alauzet; Comment. Code Commerce, ([17]); Demolombe ([18]); Le roux ([19]). If this note became due only after that deed of 1866, then the five years began to run only from its maturity which is admitted to have been more than five years before the institution of the action. If it was due before the deed of 1866 was passed, then, there the prescription runs from the date of that deed. The interruption has changed the point de depart.\nThe respondent has cited Troplong ([20]), in support of his contention that an interruption under such circum stances prolonged the period of prescription, but if he had read on to the very next article of the same book, no. 698 he would have seen that the author admits that doctrine \" qu'autant qu'il y a un contrat expr\u00e8s, explicite, s\u00e9par\u00e9, op\u00e9rant novation dans l'\u00e9tat des choses.\" And the Court of Cassation held in that sense in another case reported in Sirey ([21]), (in a case of Baillel v. Lefebvre), though art. 2264 of the Quebec Code is not to be found in express terms in the Code Napoleon, that the prescription of thirty years is substituted to that of five years, on promissory notes, only when the admission of the debt by the debtor results from a new title which changes the commercial obligation to a civil one. The respondent also cited Aubry & Rau, ([22]) but that passage does not support his case. It simply says that the acknowledgment of a debt subject to a short prescription puts off the term to thirty years when it is accompanied by a new engagement on the part of the debtor, and when the acknowledgment constitutes a title distinct from the primitive one and effective by itself. That is what I cannot see in the deed of 1866 a title distinct from the promissory note of 1863, and effective by itself. It leaves the note in full force and vigour. It refers to it for the terms of payment therefore it was not effective by itself. There was thereafter, not two debts due by Louis Pare, but the very same debt contracted in 1863, payable on the same terms, and that is why the respondent kept the note, as proof thereof.\nThe Court of Review, though admitting that there is no novation of the debt says that there is novation of title. It seems to me that this is a distinction without a difference, and the respondent has not succeeded to support it by authorities. On the contrary, I find in addition to the authorities I have already quoted, that the Court de Cassation held in 1826, ([23]) in re Cardon that: \" Une dette originairement commerciale ne perd pas ce caract\u00e8re par cela seul qu'elle est ult\u00e9rieurement reconnue par in acte notari\u00e9 et garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que. In that case, a hypothec by notarial deed had been given as surety for previous promissory notes. And though these notes had been given up to the debtor at the time of the passing of the deed the court held that the debt still remained a commercial debt. How clearer is the present case, where the note was retained by the respondent.\nLa dation de billets n\u00e9gociables en paiement d'une dette civile n'op\u00e8re pas novation dans la cran\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que de la mani\u00e8re dont les billets sont motiv\u00e9s, r\u00e9sulte clairement l'intention de nover;\" say Cham pionni\u00e8re et Rigaud ([24]), \" r\u00e9ciproquement, la connaissance par acte notari\u00e9 d'une cr\u00e9ance consistant en billets n'ob\u00e8re pas n\u00e9cessairement novation, et n'enlev\u00e9 pas \u00e0 l'obligation son caract\u00e8re commercial. La forme des actes n'influe pas en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la nature des obligations qu'ils contiennent, ainsi rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'un engagement contract\u00e9 par acte notari\u00e9 soit commercial l des lors le renouvellement d'une dette de cette nature, constat\u00e9 par bes billets n\u00e9gociables, peut avoir lieu par acte notari\u00e9 sans qu'il y ait novation.\"\nIn a case cited by the same authors, ([25]) of July 1829, the maker of four promissory notes had by a notarial deed given a hypothec for the amount. It was contended that by this deed a novation of the debt had taken place. But, said the Castel Naudary Court in terms that are so applicable to the present case, that I cite them ipsissimis verbis:\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce syst\u00e8me (c'est-\u00e0-dire la pr\u00e9hension qu'il y avait novation) est erron\u00e9 que le titre qui constitue Ia dette est toujours la lettre de change; que le contract d'affectation d'hvnoth\u00e8que na fait autre chose qu'assurer le paiement comme on le voit dans le contract lui-m\u00eame, ce qui prouve bien qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'intention des parties de faire novation puisque le contract est fait pour assurer de plus fort le paiement de ces lettres de change; qu'il est si vrai que c'est toujours dans les lettres de change que se trouve le titre constitutif de la dette que c'est en vertu des lettres de change seules que le cr\u00e9ancier pourra obtenir le paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance, tandis que le contract d'affectation d'hypoth\u00e8que ne lui suffirait pas; que de tout ce qui proc\u00e8de ii r\u00e9sulte que Pacte notari\u00e9 n'a pas op\u00e9r\u00e9 de novation, qu'il a seulement ajout\u00e9 une garantie de plus \u00e0 un acte qui a conserv\u00e9 toute sa force. That judgment, it is true; was set aside by the Court of Cassation, August 5th, 1833, but that court has since returned to the doctrine that it had adopted by its arr\u00e9t of 1826, above quoted, and which, in Championne\u00e8re & Rigaud, loc. cit., is clearly demonstrated to be based on sound principles.\nIn a case for instance, of Gr\u00e9dit Agricole y. Goddard ([26]), a hypothec by notarial deed had been given as surety of promissory notes. It was contended that the deed operated novation of the notes. But it was held by the Court of Cassation that\nla novation ne se pr\u00e9sumant pas, il ne suffit pas pour l'op\u00e9rer d'augmenter ou de diminuer la dette, de fixer in terne plus long ou plus court, et d'ajouter on de retrancher une hypoth\u00e8que, ni m\u00eame de changer l'esp\u00e8ce d'obligation, \u00e0 moins que les parties n'expriment une intention contraire ou que le second encasement ne soit n\u00e9cessairement incompatible avec le premier.\nIn a previous case of Cost\u00e9 y. Quiquandon ([27]) the same court had held in 1857 that\nne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme emportant novation la. stipulation de nouvelles garanties, telles qu'une hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e, pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 de billets promissoires.\nSee in same sense Larombi\u00e8re ([28]). and in the Court of Grenoble in a case of Duverney y. Baudet, ([29]) it was held that\nune dette originairement commerciale ne perd pas ce caract\u00e8re par cela seul qu'elle est ensuite reconnue par un acte notari\u00e9 et garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que.\nLorsque le titre primitif est express\u00e9ment conserve, says Pardessus ([30]), (and here the fact of retaining the promissory note amounts to an express reservation by the respondent of all rights upon it) \" et que sans renoncer aux droits qu'il lui attribuait, le cr\u00e9ancier a voulu une nouvelle s\u00fbret\u00e9, il acquiert tons les droits de l'acte nouveau, sans perdre aucun de ceux que lui donnait le premier.\"\nAnd at page 262 the same author says what would not seem to me questionable, that to stipulate a hypothec for \u00e0 pre-existing debt does not extinguish the primordial title. And\nA plus fore raison. 1ft passation d'un acte authentique destin\u00e9 \u00e0 remplacer un acte sous seing priv\u00e9 n'emporte-t-elle pas novation. encore que le d\u00e9biteur alt par cet acte fourni de nouvelles s\u00fbret\u00e9s, say Aubry & Ran ([31]).\nMasse, Droit Commercial. Page 266, says 286. \" Ainsi, une dette originairement commerciale ne devient pas purement civile par cela seul qu'elle est ensuite reconnue dans un acte notari\u00e9 et garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que. Il n'y a pas l\u00e0 substitution d'une obligation ou d'une dette \u00e0 une autre: l'obligation change de forme, mais an fond elle reste la m\u00eame malgr\u00e9 les garanties nouvelles dont elle est entour\u00e9e et les voies d'ex\u00e9cution qui lui sont ouvertes. L'acte notari\u00e9 n'op\u00e8re pas novation de la dette qu'il constate, et d\u00e8s lors le payement doit en \u00eatre poursuivi devant le tribunal de commerce, et non devant le tribunal civil\nBy article 189 of the Code de commerce, promissory notes are prescribed by five years, if the debt has not been admitted by a separate deed. In a case of Roux v. Sompayrac, ([32]) the Paris Court of Appeal held that a deed giving a hypothec for surety of a note did not constitute the separate deed required by this article.\nAs to the importance in this case of the fact that the respondent retained the promissory note see Sriber v. Hebentreet ([33]).\nThe fact that a hypothec has been given does not affect the prescription, as the respondent seems to con tend by his replication to the appellants' plea. If the debt is extinguished by five years' prescription, the hypothec given for that debt is also extinguished by five years. Art. 2081, part 5; Art. 2247 C. C. Troplong, Hypoth. Nos. 875, 878.\nThe Superior Court and the Court of Review rely on art. 1213 of the Code for the purpose of establishing the proposition that the plaintiff was not bound to base his action on the promissory note or even to produce it. With great deference, I cannot adopt that view. Why did he not produce that note ? It must be assumed against him by uncontroverted principles of the rules of evidence that it is because it would have told against his case. I do not think that this art. 1213 of the Code can so be taken advantage of by anyone to allow him to conceal from the tribunal that the subsisting primordial title which is in his possession, is prescribed or has lapsed for any cause whatever ([34]).\nThe doctrine that an act of recognition makes proof of the primordial title has no application where the primordial title exists, and is available to the parties. And the act of recognition in such case has no other effect but to interrupt the prescription.\nThe learned judge who gave the judgment for the Court of Appeal, bases his reasoning on the ground that the appellants have not proved that the note was due more than five years before the institution of the action\nHere is a note twenty-four years old when the action is brought; the respondent has it in his possession but does not produce it; the appellants say that it is overdue more than five years. The Court of Appeals hold that the onus probandi to prove that it was so overdue, was on the appellants. I would be disposed to think that the respondent, under these circumstances had to produce the note, if he desired to show that it was not overdue as contended by the appellants The best evidence of the controverted fact is in the document itself; and that document is in his hands Was it not incumbent on him to produce it? However, assuming that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that the proof of this fact was on the appellants, under the circumstances of this case, that ground cannot militate against them here, as the fact that it was so overdue for more than five years is not denied, and so is not in issue, and consequently is to be taken as admitted by the respondent's replication to the appellanst's plea as I have already remarked, a fact which has undoubtedly escaped the attention of the learned judges. I would come to the conclusion that on this first item the plaintiffs' action fails, on the general issue because the deed of 1866 cannot alone give him a right of action, when the other one is subsisting, and because he should have based his action on the promissory note of 1863. The appellants would then, of course. have opposed him the prescription of five years, to which he would have replied the interruption of prescription by the deed 1866, if the note was due when that deed was passed. The same question would then have presented itself, whether, by this interruption, the debt was prolonged for thirty years or for only five years; the answer, it seems clear to me would have been that the debt was prolonged only for five years; a contrary doctrine would read art 2264 out of the Code. It is only as I have attempted to demonstrate if there had been novation that the prescription of thirty years would have been the one applicable against the plaintiff's claim. And, it seems to me unquestionable upon the authorities, that there was no novation Moreover, it must not be forgotten that in such a case, if it were at all doubtful whether the parties intended to novate or not the primordial title must prevail. Boileux ([35]); Larombi\u00e8re ([36]). However assuming that the. action could be brought on the deed of 1866 alone as it has been, it must be dismissed on the plea of prescription. There is another view of this part of the case upon which, if the respondent. had been successful on the other question he would have met with a serious difficulty. He simply alleges in his declaration, this deed of 1866, without alleging when the debt became due and produces the deed. The deed refers to the note for the terms of payment. He does not produce the note or otherwise show that it was due when he brought his action. He contends that it was not necessary for him to do so, because the appellants pleaded payment and prescription. But is that a sound contention ? The appellants, it is true, pleaded payment and prescription but \" without admitting any of the allegations of the declaration, but on the contrary, denying them all formally,\" and pleaded, besides, the general issue. Now, had not the plaintiff to prove his case, before the defendants had to enter upon their defence ? Did he prove that anything was due to him, when he sued ? Thayer v. Wilscam ([37]); Sarault v. Ellice ([38]); Leclerc v. Girard ([39]).\nThen, if the note is not prescribed as he would contend, he should by his action, or, at least, before he could obtain judgment against the appellants, have tendered it back to them, or deposited it in court to be handed back to them.\nAs to the other items of the respondent's claim I adopt the Court of Review's reasoning and conclusions, and without entering into any other details, but those necessary to make the ground of my judgment intelligible to the parties themselves, I reach the result that the respondent's action must be dismissed in toto, upon the following statement:\u2014\nThe respondent's claim on these items amounts to. $5,004 29 I deduct from it:\nCare during last illness..\n$ 66 00\nBoard of horses.\n125 00\nTaking care of effects.....\n25 00\nPension for 12 months...\n144 00\n28 months at black smith's shop. ... ...\n336 00\n38 months rent of derricks\n380 00\n38 months' rent of tools..\n76 00\n38 months' rent of wagons, &c\n76 00\n38 months rent of harnesses\n44 00\nFor oats, hay, meal .......\n60 53\nFor oats, hay, meal from farmers..........\n632 90\nTimber Miller & Prevost\n59 84\nTimber by plaintiff\n62 00\n$2,087 27\n$2,087 27\n$2,917 02\n$2917022 which is more than paid by the $3,144.45 to appellant's credit, so that it is unnecessary to consider the other deductions made by the Court of Review.\nThe result is that the appeal must be allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs, in the four courts against respondent, distraits to Messrs.

By sec. 16 of the appellant's charter it is stipulated that each car employed by the company shall be licensed and numbered, etc., for which the company shall pay \u201cover and above all other taxes the sum of $20 for each two-horse car, and $10 for each one-horse car.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below that the company are liable for the tax of $2.50 on each and every one of its horses\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed the appellants' action with costs.\nThis was an action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l''ind\u00fb by which the plaintiffs claim to be refunded the sum of $6,39 paid by them under coercion to the defendant for the annual tax imposed at the rate of $2.50 for each horse on the horses employee by the plaintiffs for the service of their cars in the City of Montreal, during the years 1887, 1888 and 1889.\nA clause in the contract entered into between the City of Montreal and the Montreal Street Railway Company in 1886, reads as follows: The company shall not use their cars, unless they shall have obtained a license and number for which the said company shall pay, over and above all other taxes, the sum of twenty dollars ($20) for each two-horse car and ten dollars ($10) for each one-horse car.\"\nOn the 21st of April, 1876, the corporation passed by-law no. 94, intituled: \" By-law concerning' taxes and assessments\" enacting, in section 26 thereof, that: \" An annual tax is imposed and shall be leveed upon all owners of horses in the said city as follows, via.: for every \" working-horse,\" at the rate of $2.50,\" which was in force at the time the action was instituted.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was: Whether the city can claim from the company, over and above the tax imposed by the contract, another tax on each of its horses used exclusively to drive the cars, as is payable by the owners of working horses under by-law 14.\nBranchaud Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C., for appellants.\nEthier Q.C. for respondent.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le pr\u00e9sent jugement porte en appel \u00e0 cette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, confirmant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui avait renvoy\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa compagnie demanderesse r\u00e9clamait le remboursement de $6,739 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de payer \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse pour taxe annuelle impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la dite demanderesse \u00e0 raison de $2.50 pour chaque cheval de travail, sur le nombre de chevaux employ\u00e9s par Ia dite compagnie comme pouvoir moteur pour ses chars dans les rues de Montr\u00e9al, pendant les ann\u00e9es 1887,. 1888, 1889.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse r\u00e9sista \u00e0 cette demande sur le principe qu'elle ne doit \u00e0 la cite que les taxes qui lui sont impos\u00e9es par son contrat avec la dite cit\u00e9; que la dite taxe de $2.50 pay\u00e9e par l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas comprise dans le dit contrat, et que la dite compagnie n'est pas sujette \u00e0 l'application des r\u00e8glements municipaux imposant des taxes et licences sur les working horses; que les taxes qu'ils doivent sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et fix\u00e9es par leur contrat; que les chevaux employ\u00e9s ne le sont que comme pouvoir moteur des chars et ne sont pas cotisables en cons\u00e9quence du privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie par son contrat.\nLa seule question soulev\u00e9e dans cette instance est an sujet des diff\u00e9rentes clauses de l'arrangement entre I appellante et la corporation de Montr\u00e9al, accordant a la dite compagnie le privilege d'exploiter une ligne de chemin de fer pour le transport des passagers en dedans des limites de la cite, et l'application des r\u00e8glements municipaux imposant des taxes et licences sur les chevaux de travail appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie ou \u00e0 tout autre contribuable.\nLe 21 avril 1876, ayant adopt\u00e9e le r\u00e8glement No. 94, intitul\u00e9: \" By-law concerning taxes and assessments,\" il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par la section 26 de ce r\u00e8glement \" qu'une taxe annuelle est impos\u00e9e et sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous pro pari\u00e9taires de chevaux dans la dite cite comme suit, savoir: pour chaque cheval de travail, \u00e0 raison de $2.50.\"\nCe r\u00e8glement est devenu en force le jour m\u00eame de sa sanction et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 ni amend\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la section 26. Les termes de ce r\u00e8glement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et atteignent la compagnie demanderesse aussi bien que les particuliers ou autres contribuables, du moment qu'ils sont propri\u00e9taires de chevaux de travail.\nDepuis la mise en force de ce r\u00e8glement \u00e0 venir jus qu'\u00e0 1887, l'appelante n'a fait aucune objection et a paye sans prot\u00eat la taxe qu'elle devait pour chaque cheval de travail qu'elle avait. Mais la compagnie s'est ravis\u00e9e, elle a cru qu'en payant sans prot\u00eat, elle pourrait ensuite an moyen d'une action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb se faire rembourser et se soustraire \u00e0 cette taxe. Ils ont ainsi pay\u00e9 au tr\u00e9sor municipal une somme de $6739 qu'elle essaie de se faire rembourser. Il n'y a aucune contestation au sujet du mandat.\nEn payant le montant ci-dessus, m\u00eame sans prot\u00eat, la compagnie na fait que s'acquitter d'une dette l\u00e9gitime et n'a pay\u00e9 ni par erreur dc fait, ni par erreur de droit. Elle \u00e9tait et est encore actuellement une compagnie, faisant des affaires dans les limite de la cite et contribuable, soumise \u00e0 l'effet de tons les r\u00e8glements municipaux \u00e0 moins d'en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9e par une autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente. Une telle exemption ne se pr\u00e9sume pas et ne peut pas \u00eatre induite de termes plus ou moins explicites ou ambigus mais dolt \u00eatre clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e; telle est la question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nEn d\u00e9cembre 1885, la cit\u00e9 passa un r\u00e8glement en vertu duquel elle accorda pour vingt-cinq ans \u00e0 l'appelante le privil\u00e8ge d'exploiter un chemin de fer urbain; ce r\u00e8glement contient toutes les conditions auxquelles ce privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9.

La distinction de two-horse et de one-horse car n'avait pas d'autre but que de cr\u00e9er deux classes de chars, l'une plus grande que l'autre et devant payer une taxe plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\nLes mots over and above all other taxes comprennent n\u00e9cessairement les taxes que I'appelante avait pay\u00e9es comme tous les autres contribuables et en paiement desquelles elle ne peut se soustraire \u00e0 moins d'en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9e.\nL'appelante ne peut se plaindre d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par surprise, ni accuser la cite de vouloir changer l'\u00e9tat de chose existant depuis bien des ann\u00e9es puisqu'elle a agi en pleine connaissance des dispositions du r\u00e8glement. Le privil\u00e8ge quelle poss\u00e8de actuellement pour vingt cinq ans n'est que le renouvellement de celui expire il y a quelques ann\u00e9es.\nPendant les vingt-cinq ans de Ta dur\u00e9e de la premi\u00e8re concession de ce privil\u00e8ge l\u2019appelante a toujours pay\u00e9 les taxes et les licences, sans objection.

En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014There is nothing in this appeal. In 1886, this railway company obtained from the City of Montreal, a charter for twenty-five years.

The property of N., insured by this policy, was destroyed by fire and in lieu of the required account he delivered to the agent of the insurers an affidavit in which, after stating the general character of the property insured, he swore that his invoice book had been burned and he had no adequate means of estimating the exact amount of his loss, but that he had made as careful an estimate as the nature and circumstances of the case would admit of and found the loss to be between $3,000 and $4,000.\nAn action on the policy was defended on the ground of non-compliance with said condition. On the trial the jury answered all the questions submitted to them, except two, in favour of N. These two questions, whether or not N. could have made a tolerably complete list of the contents of his store immediately before the fire, and whether or not he delivered as particular an account, etc. (as in the conditions) were not answered. The trial judge gave judgment in favour of N. which the court en banc reversed and ordered judgment to be entered for the company.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court en banc, that as the evidence conclusively showed that N., with the assistance of his clerk, could have made a tolerably correct list of the goods lost the condition was not complied with.\nHeld further, that as under the evidence the jury could not have answered the questions they refused to answer in favour of N. a new trial was unnecessary and judgment was properly entered for the company. APPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering judgment to be entered in favour of the defendants.\nThe following statement of the material facts of the case is taken from the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Sedge wick:\u2014\nOn the 10th December, 1889, the defendant company issued to the appellant a policy of insurance upon his stock of general merchandise contained in his store at Middleton, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia. The goods insured were burned on the 29th of May, 1891, and this action is brought to recover the amount of the insurance. One of the conditions indorsed upon the policy was the following:\u2014\nXII. Persons insured sustaining any loss or damage by fire are forthwith to give notice thereof to the Company, or to the agent through whom the insurance was effected, and within fourteen days thereafter deliver in as particular an account of their loss or damage, and of the value of the property destroyed or damaged immediately before the happening of the fire, as the nature and circumstances of the case will admit of, and make proof of the same by declaration or affirmation, and by their books of accounts, or such other reasonable evidence as. the Company or its agent may require; and until such evidence is produced the amount of such loss, or any part thereof, shall not be payable or recoverable; and if there appear any fraud or false statement, or that the fire shall have happened by the procurement, wilful act, or means or connivance of the insured or claimants, he, she, or they shall be excluded from all benefit under this policy. No profit of any kind is to be included in such claim. And in the event of no claim being made within three calendar months after the occurrence of the fire the insured shall forfeit and be barred of every right to restitution or payment by virtue of this policy, and time shall be the essence of the contract.\nIt was proved at the trial that the assured did not within fourteen days after the fire or subsequently deliver to the company any particular account of his loss. The only document delivered was an affidavit of w hch the following is a copy:\u2014 I, Samuel Nixon, of Nictaux Falls, make oath and say as follows:\u2014\n1. That I am the party who was owner of property which was destroyed by fire, which occurred at Nictaux Falls, in the county of Annapolis, on the morning of May 29th, 1891.\n2. A part of the said property consisted of general merchandise, and said merchandise consisted principally of dry goods, boots, shoes,\nand groceries and hardware, contained in a 1\u00bd storey wooden building, said building being situate on the south side of the road leading to Bridgewater, at the said Nictaux Falls.\n3. Said property was, at the time the fire occurred, insured in the Queen Insurance Company, under policy no. 1253409, which policy I hold.\n4. That my invoice book was burned in said fire and I therefore have no adequate means of estimating the exact value of the property covered by said insurance policy at the time or immediately before the fire occurred.\n5. That I have made as careful an estimate of the value of property covered by said insurance and destroyed by said fire as the nature and circumstances of the case will admit of, and find the same to be between three thousand and four thousand (3,000 and 4,000) dollars.\n6. The day after the fire occurred I mailed a notice of said fire to W. P. King, General Insurance Agent, Truro.\n7. I have no knowledge as to how the said fire originated.\n8. That I make this affidavit in pursuance of the directions referred to in said policy and endorsed thereon Section XII.\nSworn to at Bridgetown, in the County of Annapolis, this 10th day of June, A.D., 1891, before me,\n(Sgd.) John L. Cox,\nA Justice of the Peace for the County of Annapolis.\n(Sgd.) SAMUEL NIXON.\nThe defendants set up as a defence the plaintiff's failure in this regard. The case was brought on for trial before the learned Chief Justice and a jury who, in answer to the questions submitted by the presiding judge, found that the plaintiff's loss was an honest one; that he was guilty of no fraud; that the value of the goods at the time of the fire was about $3,000; and that he gave notice of his loss pursuant to the conditions of the policy. They declined, however, to answer the following questions submitted to them by counsel for the plaintiff and defendant respectively:\u2014 Could the plaintiff immediately after the fire, with the assistance of his clerk, Miss Robinson, or otherwise, have made up a tolerably complete list of the contents of his store immediately before the fire?\nDid the plaintiff deliver to the defendant company as particular an account of his loss or damage by the said fire, and of the value of the property destroyed immediately before the happening of the fire, as the nature and circumstances of the case would admit of?\nUpon these findings and want of findings the learned judge gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the amount claimed with costs.\nUpon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia this judgment was unanimously reversed and judgment was ordered to be entered for the defendant company with costs.\nThe plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellant. The books of the plaintiff having been burnt his affidavit was sufficient compliance with the condition. Norton v. Rensselaer & Saratoga Ins. Co.[2]; McLaughlin v. Washington County Ins. Co.[3]. And see also Pim v. Reid[4].\nHarrington Q C. and Mellish for the respondents. The insured was bound to comply strictly with the condition in the policy. Roper v. Lendon[5]; Ripley v. \u00c6tna Ins. Co.[6].\nAs there is no evidence on which the jury could find for plaintiff a new trial will not be ordered for their refusal to answer certain questions submitted to them. Bobbett v. South Eastern Railway Co.[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014(His Lordship recited the facts of the case as stated above and proceeded as follows.) I entirely concur in the judgment of the court below. The plaintiff did not deliver as particular an account of his loss as the nature and circumstances of the case admitted of; the evidence is conclusive on this point. Although the plaintiff may not himself have been personally aware in detail of the goods destroyed by fire yet his clerk and book keeper, one Ella Robinson, who was in charge of the store at the time of the fire, stated that she could, with plenty of time immediately after the fire, have made up a tolerably correct list, and the plaintiff himself tendered in evidence an affidavit made by her on the 24th June which describes with the most minute particularity the goods in the store at the time of the fire. The plaintiff himself, in his evidence, describes with much greater particularity than in the affidavit which he submitted immediately after the fire the goods in the store, and it is absolutely out of the question for him to say, in fact he never has said, that it was impossible for him to have given a more full or particular statement than he did. The only question in the case, it appears to me, is not as to whether the judgment of the learned judge below was erroneous, but whether, under the circumstances, a new trial should not have been ordered. We are of opinion that the court was right in the present case in ordering judgment for the defendant.\nIt would seem that the court, under the judicature rules, cannot enter a judgment inconsistent with the findings of the jury. In this case there is no finding; the jury expressly declined to find upon the sole question now in controversy. It was, I think, a question of fact whether the plaintiff delivered as particular an account of his loss as the nature of the case admitted of. I can conceive of cases in which it might be absolutely impossible for a claimant upon an insurance company to deliver any account whatever, but the existence of that impossibility would be a question for the jury, but in the present case it is clear that if the jury had answered this question in the affirmative the finding would have been set aside, not only as against the weight of evidence but because the evidence is conclusively the other way.\nIt being apparent from the evidence that under the facts in this case it is impossible for the plaintiff to recover, and there being no findings of a jury to prevent the court from exercising its powers in this respect it was a proper exercise of the court's jurisdiction to dismiss the plaintiff's action as they did.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau and Sedgewick JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nEvidence\u2014Foundation for secondary evidence\u2014Execution of agreement\u2014 Laches\u2014Right to relief inconsistent with claim.\nOn the hearing of an equity suit, secondary evidence of a document was tendered on proof that its proper custodian was out of the jurisdiction and supposed to be in Scotland; that a letter had been written to him asking for it, and to his sister and other persons connected with him, inquiring as to his whereabouts, but information was not obtained.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that this was not a sufficient foundation for secondary evidence; that the letters should have stated that this specific paper was wanted; that an independent person should have been employed to make inquiries in Scotland for the custodian of the document, and to ask for it if he had been found; and that a commission might have been issued to the Court of Session in Scotland, and a commission appointed by that court to procure the attendance of the custodian and his examination as a witness.\nThe suit was for specific performance of an agreement by C, one of the beneficiaries under a will vesting the testator's estate in trustees for division among her children, to sell lands of the estate in New Brunswick to the plaintiff P.; and the document as to which secondary evidence was offered was an alleged agreement by the trustees and other beneficiaries to convey the said lands to C. The evidence was received, but only established the execution of the alleged agreement by one of the trustees and one of the beneficiaries, and the proof of the contents was not consistent with the documentary evidence and the case made out by the bill.\nHeld, that if the evidence was admissible it would not establish the plaintiff's case; that the alleged agreement, not being signed by both the trustees, could convey no estate, legal or equitable, to C.; and that the proof of its contents was not satisfactory.\nAt the hearing P. claimed to be entitled to a decree, in the event of the case made by his bill falling, on the ground that the said will was not registered according to the registry laws of New Brunswick, and was therefore void as against him an intending purchaser, and C. had an interest in the land he had agreed to sell to him as an heir-at-law of the estate.\nHeld, that on a bill claiming title under the will, P. could not have relief based on the proposition that the same will was void against him, and no amendment could be permitted to make a case not only at variance with, but antagonistic to, that set out in the bill, especially as such amendment was not asked for until the hearing.\nThe agreement of sale to P. was executed in 1884, and the suit was not instituted until four years later. P. was in possession of the land during the interval.\nHeld, that as the evidence clearly showed that P. was only in possession as agent of the trustees and caretaker of the land, and as by the terms of the agreement time was to be of the essence of the contract, the delay was a sufficient answer to the suit.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick reversing the judgment of the Judge in Equity in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of the court.\nMcLeod Q.C. and Palmer Q.C. for the appellant. That the secondary evidence was properly admitted, see Slasser v. Gloyop[1].\nThe plaintiff is entitled to a decree for an\u0443 interest that Angus Campbell may be shown to have had in the estate Graham v. Olliver[2].\nThe defence of laches was not pleaded and cannot be set up by the defendant, as the delay was caused by Angus Campbell, one of their grantors. See Morse v. Merest[3].\nWeldon Q.C. Currey and Vince for the respondents, referred to Doe d. Richards v. Lewis[4] and Boyle v. Wiseman[5]. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick sitting in appeal from the Judge in Equity, whereby the court, (Mr. Justice Hanington dissenting), reversed a decree in a suit for specific performance and for an injunction to restrain proceedings in an action of trespass brought by certain of the defendants. The plaintiff in the suit has appealed to this court against the latter judgment which was concurred in by the Chief Justice and by King and Fraser JJ.\nBy articles of agreement dated the 7th of August, 1884, signed and sealed by the parties thereto and made between Angus W. Campbell, a defendant to the suit, of the first part, and the appellant Joseph B. Porter, of the other part, Angus W. Campbell, who was a son of Lady Campbell the testatrix hereafter mentioned, and one of the beneficiaries under her will, contracted to sell to the appellant certain lands in New Brunswick, comprising in all about 3,389 acres, for the price of $3,000 payable as follows, namely:\u2014 $1,000 when the vendor Angus Campbell should have prepared and ready to be delivered to the appellant a good and sufficient deed in fee simple of these lands, which conveyance Angus W. Campbell agreed to make or cause to be made within three months from the date of the agreement. And it was further agreed that the residue of the price should be paid in two annual instalments of $1,000 each. Further, it was stipulated that time should be of the essence of the agreement. The articles also contained a recital that the lands agreed to be sold were, by the last will and testament of Sir John Campbell, devised to Helen Lady Campbell, his wife, and were then held in trust for her, as the said Angus W. Campbell supposed. The appellant besides stating the before mentioned agreement by his bill alleged in substance as follows: \u2014 Helen Lady Campbell, the widow of Major General Sir John Campbell, being under her husband's will seised in fee of the lands in question, made her will whereby she devised the same lands to four trustees upon certain trusts, the ultimate trusts as regards these New Brunswick lands being that the trustees should divide and apportion the same amongst her surviving children, except Sir Archibald Campbell the eldest son of the testatrix, and power was given to the trustees in their discretion to sell and turn into cash the lands in New Brunswick. The testatrix died on the 3rd May, 1883. The bill further alleged as follows:\u2014That only two of the trustees, John Myles and James Ogilvie Holdane, accepted the trusts of the will, and that these trustees appointed the defendant Angus W. Campbell their attorney and agent in the Province of New Brunswick to look after, sell and dispose of the lands in question; that the agreement referred to was registered in the proper registry office in New Brunswick on the 24th November, 1884; that by an agreement of sale made between the trustees before named and Helen Elizabeth Barbara Campbell (who was a daughter of the testatrix and one of the beneficiaries under her will) and Angus W. Campbell, the lands mentioned in the agreement were bargained and sold by the first mentioned parties to Angus W. Campbell. That after this sale and on or about the 24th November, 1886, the trustees made a deed bearing date the day and year last mentioned whereby they purported to convey the same lands to the defendant Helen Elizabeth Barbara Campbell for the consideration of $2,338.67.\nThe bill further stated that on or about the 18th March, 1887, Helen Elizabeth Barbara Campbell sold and conveyed the same lands for the consideration of $3,400 to the defendants Irvine and Hale, who afterwards for valuable consideration sold and conveyed a part interest therein to the defendant Donald Fraser; that all the last named defendants had full notice of the appellant's claim to the lands and of the agreement between the appellant and the defendant Angus W. Campbell before and at the time they accepted their deed. The appellant further alleged and charged that the conveyances from the trustees to Miss Campbell, and from Miss Campbell to the defendants Irvine and Hale, were made and accepted for the sole and only purpose of defrauding the appellant and to defeat and annul the sale made to the appellant by Angus W. Campbell, and that the defendants Hale, Irvine and Fraser had brought an action of trespass against the appellant for alleged trespasses committed on the land comprised in the appellant's agreement with Angus W. Campbell.\nThe bill prayed for specific performance against the defendant Angus W. Campbell, and that it should be decreed that the defendant Angus W. Campbell was the agent and attorney of the trustees, the defendants Myles and Holdane, in making the agreement. That it should be decreed and declared that the defendants Myles and Holdane sold the lands to the defendant Angus W. Campbell and that he sold the same to the appellant, and that they might be decreed to convey the same to the appellant. Further, it was prayed that the deed from the trustees Myles and Holdane to Miss Campbell and from Miss Campbell to the defendants Hale and Irvine and any conveyance from the latter to the defendant Fraser might be declared fraudulent and void as against the appellant; that the defendants Irvine, Hale and Fraser might be restrained from cutting timber on the land in controversy; and that further proceedings in the action at law might be restrained. The bill was taken pro confesso against the defendants Myles and Holdane, and also against the defendants Miss Helen Elizabeth Barbara Campbell and Angus W. Campbell.\nThe defendants Irvine, Hale and Eraser answered denying the appellant's title and putting him to proof thereof, and insisting on the validity of their own title and denying all notice of any title in the appellant at the time of their respective purchases.\nThe cause coming on to be heard before the judge in equity, Mr. Justice Palmer, that learned judge made a decree in favour of the plaintiff for specific performance and an injunction as prayed. Upon appeal against this decree to the Supreme Court in banc that court pronounced judgment reversing the decree made by the court of first instance, and ordering that a decree be entered dismissing the bill with costs.\nFull written judgments were delivered by Mr. Justice King and Mr. Justice Fraser, the Chief Justice concurring in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice King. The judgment of the court as indicated by Mr. Justice King and Mr. Justice Fraser proceeded upon the following grounds: It was held that the alleged agreement with the trustees under which Angus W. Campbell claimed title was not sufficiently proved for the following reasons; the agreement itself not being produced it was considered by the court that a proper foundation for the admission of secondary evidence of that instrument had not been laid, and that even if secondary evidence was admissible the parol evidence was insufficient to establish it. Further, it was held that the delay in instituting the suit had been such that the defence of laches would by itself have been fatal to the appellant's claim for relief. Lastly, it was considered that in the state of the pleadings, and under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the appellant was not entitled to specific performance to the extent of Angus W. Campbell's share as one of the coheirs of his mother, this relief having been claimed for the first time at the hearing in the event of the case made by the bill of a claim under the will failing, upon the principle that the will was void as against the appellant under the registry laws for want of registration within three years from the date of the death of the testator.\nI am of opinion that in all these respects the conclusions arrived at by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick were correct and that its judgment should be affirmed. I do not feel called upon to refer to the evidence in detail as it has been stated with fulness and particularity in the judgments of Mr. Justice King and Mr. Justice Fraser, to which I refer. It appears to me that no sufficient foundation for the reception of the secondary evidence of the agreement or other written document, whatever it may have been, under which Angus W. Campbell claimed to have a title from the trustees and his sister, was laid and that therefore the parol evidence of the appellant and of Mr. Gallagher, the conveyancer who prepared the agreement of the 7th of August, 1884, ought to have been rejected. There can be no doubt that the discretion of the judge of first instance who admitted this evidence is subject to be reviewed on appeal. The proper custodian of the document in question was, of course, Angus W. Campbell. He had returned to Scotland in the latter part of 1884. He was undoubtedly without the jurisdiction of the New Brunswick courts, but that was no reason why proper inquiries should not have been made of him as to this document, inquiries which it was incumbent on the appellant to show he made before he could be in a position to give parol evidence of its contents. The appellant did, it is true, write letters addressed to Angus W. Campbell, but in none of these, nor in the letter written to Miss Campbell, does it appear that he ever inquired for this paper. Then in the letter written to Myles it does not appear, even from Porter's own evidence, that in his inquiry for Angus Campbell he made any reference to this agreement or document on the proof of which his case now depends, as Mr. Justice Fraser points out; what he did refer to was his own agreement with Angus, not to the agreement between the trustees and Angus. He did not intimate to Myles that he wanted to find Angus in order to procure from him this important paper or information as to it. Moreover, his letter of the 12th February, 1886, is not consistent with his making any inquiries of Myles in the character of a purchaser of these lands; it would rather appear to Myles that what the appellant wanted Angus for had reference to the accounts for he does not in this letter make any pretentions to an interest in the lands. It was natural, therefore, that Myles in his answer should tell him as he did that the accounts had to be settled, not with Angus but with the trustees.\nWhat the appellant should have done was this; he should have stated in his letters to Angus and Miss Campbell that he wanted this specific paper, and in his letters to Myles he should have asked for information as to Angus stating that his object in making the inquiries was to obtain this document. Moreover he might, and I think he ought, to have had inquiries made in Scotland by some independent person, in order first to ascertain where Angus Campbell was to be found, and then if Angus should have been found he should have been asked for the paper in question. Nothing of this kind was done.\nFurther, a commission might have been issued addressed to the Court of Session, and under the Imperial Statutes (22 Vict. cap. 20 and 48 & 49 Vict. cap. 74) that court would have appointed a commissioner to take evidence before whom the attendance of Angus W. Campbell and his examination as a witness might have been enforced by the appropriate process in use in Scotland to compel the attendance and examination of witnesses.\nI must, therefore, concur with the court below in holding that no proper effort was made to enforce or procure the production of the written instrument, the contents of which it was sought under exceptional rules of evidence to prove by oral testimony.\nThen, assuming the parol evidence to have been admissible, it was insufficient to establish that any document had ever been executed by the trustees vesting any title to these lands in Angus W. Campbell. Unless such an instrument as that described in the evidence of both Porter and Gallagher had been signed by both trustees it was worthless as an instrument conferring title, either legal or equitable, on Angus. Mr. Myles may have signed it but for want of the concurrence of his co-trustee, Mr. Holdane, it might have been wholly inoperative. Then neither Porter nor Gallagher pretend to say it was executed by Mr. Holdane. Further, the description of the contents of the paper produced by Angus as given by both Porter and Gallagher was not satisfactory. Porter's statemeut does not accord with that contained in his bill which he swore to. In his letter to Myles of 12th February, 1886, he does not assume the position of a purchaser but very plainly refers to himself as still the mere agent for the estate. He says, \"I am paying taxes and having a good share of trouble and work looking after the lands and getting very little for my trouble.\" Surely such a statement as this is entirely inconsistent with a consciousness of the claim he now advances as a purchaser who had acquired a title under his agreement with Angus. Had Angus Campbell really produced to the appellant such a document as he pretends Angus then had in his possession, he must when he wrote this letter, have known that he had a title in equity. Gallagher, as I have said, does not say more than does Porter himself as to the parties to the paper which he saw in the possession of Angus.\nThen, as Mr. Justice Fraser points out, Gallagher speaks of a sale by Angus W. Campbell as a person \"authorized by some parties interested in the estate,\" which is quite inconsistent with the case made at the hearing and on the assumed proof of which the original decree was made.\nOn the whole I must agree with the court below that assuming the parol evidence to have been admissible it would have been insufficient to establish the plaintiff's case.\nThe probability is that the instrument which Gallagher saw was some agreement in anticipation of a title to be acquired by Angus Campbell from the trustees. The letter from Myles to Angus Campbell of the 1st August, 1884, which was produced and put in evidence by the appellant himself, does not refer to any completed contract or arrangement between the trustees and Angus but rather to some such transaction being in contemplation.\nThe appellant cannot have the relief which he asked for in the event of his case as made by his bill failing, namely, a decree for specific performance to the extent of the share of Angus W. Campbell as one of the coheirs of his mother, the testatrix Lady Campbell. The claim to this relief was based on the ground that the will had become fraudulent and void as against the appellant as a purchaser from one of the heirs under the registry law by reason of its not having been registered within three years from the death of the testatrix, as required by the New Brunswick Registration Act. It is impossible that on this bill claiming title under Lady Campbell's will the appellant could have a decree founded on the proposition that the same will was fraudulent and void against him. Then no amendment could be permitted, consistently with the general and reasonable rules of equitable procedure, which would make a case not only at variance with but actually antagonistic to that seated by the bill, and that, too, an amendment not asked for until the cause had reached the stage of the hearing. Lastly, it is not an unreasonable inference, as Mr. Justice Fraser points out, that the appellant must have had notice of the will. Then the agreement of the 7th August, 1884, itself on its face refers inferentially to Lady Campbell's will when it refers to her trustees and this would establish notice.\nLastly, the delay alone is a sufficient answer to the suit. The agreement was entered into on the 7th August, 1884; the first payment of purchase money and the delivery of the deed was to be in three months thereafter. By the agreement time was to be of the essence of the contract. It is out of the question to say that the plaintiff was ever in possession otherwise than as a mere agent and caretaker in the face of his letter to Myles of the 12th February, 1888. Upon this point the case of Mills v. Haywood[6], cited in the judgment of my brother King, is an authority. Then the appellant did not file his bill until October, 1888, nearly four yeas after Angus Campbell had made default in not producing a title. This delay must on well established principles of the law governing relief by way of specific performance be fatal to the plaintiff even if the trustees were shown to have entered into some executory agreement with Angus preceding in point of time the conveyance to Miss Campbell.\nI should have said that I consider the case of Sugden v. Lord St. Leonards[7], relied on by the judge in equity, to have no application to a case like the present. It establishes, no doubt, an important principle of the law of evidence applicable in testamentary causes but is no authority for extending the doctrine of presumption for the purpose of general application.\nThe result is that we dismiss the appeal. This will still leave the plaintiff's remedy at law intact, and it will be open to him to pursue it by action against Angus W. Campbell (or against his estate if he is dead) for damages for breach of contract.\nThe dismissal must of course be with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C. A.

Should said experts find that the plaintiff has failed to fulfil any part of said contract, as to said steam plant, they are directed to state specially what part, how the defects they have found can be remedied and at what costs.\"\nTo this question the arbitrators found certain defects in the steam plant, and stated that it would cost some $957 to remedy these defects.\nThe Superior Court after argument dismissed the action on the ground that the plant was not completed according to contract and that until it was no right of action accrued to the plaintiffs.\nBeique Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for the appellants:\nThe question in this case is whether there has not been any delivery but an acceptance by the company? Although respondents may originally have been entitled to insist on minute performance, and to postpone payment till it was obtained, it does not necessarily follow that they could do so after using the plant, as they have done, both for the purposes connected and unconnected with the contract. By so usiner it they plainly waived strict performance as a preliminary to \u2022payment; appropriated the plant to themselves; and made it a question not as to whether they were bound to pay, but merely as to the amount due.\nThe case of Ro\u00e8ckt v. Deruttis reported in Dalloz ([2]) is here in point. See also on arts. 1521 and 1527 C.C.\nAs to the claims for carbons which were furnished and used by the corporation, they do not form part of the contract and the corporation should pay for them.\nNow as to the right of action notwithstanding the clause in the contract relating to arbitration\nIt cannot seriously be pretended, that we are precluded from taking suit by reason of this clause in the contract. The right of a citizen to seek redress from the courts, is a matter of public order, and he cannot deprive himself of this right, in advance, and with regard to disputes which have not yet arisen. An existing dispute may be legally submitted to arbitration by a deed of submission which complies with the requirements of the law (art. 1341 Code of Civil Procedure), and the parties to such a deed, are no doubt bound to carry it out. But no such deed of submission, was ever passed between the parties. See article 1344 C. C. P. which says: \"deeds of submission made out of court, must state the names and addition of the parties and arbitrators, the object in dispute, and the lime within which the amount of the arbitration must be given.\nWe may add that appellants would have been willing to arbitrates, but as their garants, Leonard & Sons, refused to agree to this, and as an award of the arbitrators to which they did not consent, and were not parties, could not bind the latter, appellants had no other recourse but to sue in the ordinary way.\nIrvine Q.C., for respondents. Up to the time of the bringing of the action the property was not in the possession of the respondents, but was run by and under the control of the appellants, and as the experts and two courts have found that the work was not then completed, the company could not claim payment. As to the claims for extras, while the proof of it would have been sufficient had it been the only transaction between the parties, it was insufficient to show it to be independent of the contract. The first question in the case is: whether the plaintiffs, appellants, had a right to resort to the tribunals direct, as they did by bringing the present suit, or whether they were not bound first to offer to the defendant to submit the questions in dispute between them to arbitration. I contend that the contract contains a distinct agreement that in case of any dispute between the parties with reference to their contract or the execution thereof, all question of difference between them should be settled by arbitration to be appointed in the ordinary manner. This agreement is express and most distinct, and in this case is the law of the parties. It is a stipulation permitted by our laws, and the plaintiff had no power to override it without the consent of the defendants. See Quebec Street Railway v. The Corporation of Quebec ([3])\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nFOURNIER. J.\u2014By their action, the appellant company claim from the City of Three Rivers $33,000, being part of the price of the electric light plant, which they had agreed by the contract of the 17th May, 1890, to instal for the City of Three Rivers; and also a further sum of $5,000 for sundry materials &c. and for extra work.\nThis contract, made sous seing priv\u00e9, is given at length in the case. The contestation rests upon the two following paragraphs of the contract in question;\n\u201c7th. The said city shall pay for said installation and plants as above, the sum of $35,000, $330000 whereof after the plant had been kept in satisfactory operation by the said company for the term of 30 days as above and balance $2000 after the said plant hat been in satisfactory operation for a term of six months from the date of starting from the permanent station.\n\" 8th. In case of dispute between the parties with reference to the present contract or the execution thereof all question of differences between them shall be settled by arbitration to be appointed in the ordinary manner.\u201d\nBy the present action the appellants allege that on the 8th December, 1890, they had fulfilled the greater part of their obligations in the contract they offered to complete the works remaining tobe done, upon payment of $33,000, the first instalment of the contract price, and upon payment of $5,000 for extras.\nThe respondents pleaded to this action, that the appellant s had no right of action for the following reasons: 1st. because they had not fulfilled the conditions of the contract and that their works had not been put in operation for thirty days after their completion. 2nd, because, under the contract, the appellants were obliged, before taking any action against the city to submit to arbitration any difficulties which might arise on the subject of the execution of the work.\nThe first question to be decided is, then, whether the appellants had the right to appeal directly to the tribunals as they have done by their action, before giving the respondent an opportunity of referring the questions in dispute between them, to arbitration.\nAlthough this question is an important one, it is not my intention to discuss it. I shall content myself with citing a recent case in which the Court of Queen's Bench at Quebec, maintained the legality of a similar condition, viz., the case of Quebec street Railway Co. v. The Corporation of Quebec ([4]), where it was decided. \" that the court has jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator to act on behalf of a party refusing to appoint such arbitrator, where the parties have covenanted that the matter in dispute should be determined by arbitration.\" In that case the Hon. Mr. Justice Tessier made the following remarks: \"The second point is the arbitration. The parties desired and agreed to it; cousequently one party cannot fail to comply with his obligations. Arbitration experts, are methods of determining litigious contestations, and can be utilised by our laws and according to our rules of procedure. In demanding arbitration, the parties wished to follow the rules of ordinary arbitration, unless they have stipulated the contrary, or particular rules.\"\nIf then one of the parties refuses to name the arbitrators, the court has jurisdiction to enforce it, or to appoint them itself, and to appoint a third arbitrator in case of a difference of opinion between the two others. Courts of justice have this jurisdiction even in cases where the parties do not agree to it; why then, should they not have jurisdiction in a case, like the present, where the parties have themselves stipulated for it ?\nIt is useless to discuss the question further, because its decision cannot in any way affect this case, the Superior Court having, in the first instance, ordered an arbitration in which the arbitrators made a unanimous report which has been accepted by the two courts below, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal.\nThe second question to be considered is whether the appellants had fulfilled all the conditions of the contract and put in satisfactory operation, for thirty days after their completion the works contracted for.\nThe appellants do not contend they did. They merely allege that the delay of thirty days should begin to run on the 8th December, 1890, and that the greater part of their works were then finished thus admitting thereby that they were not completely finished. The evidence on this part of the case showed that the work was incomplete and not properly executed, and the court with the consent of the parties referred the matter to the arbitrators with instructions to report upon the following questions:\u2014\n1st. Whether the plaintiff had on the 8th day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety, or ever since, substantially fulfilled its part of said contract as to quality, capacity, installation and saving of fuel of sail steam plant;\n2nd Whether the joints in the said electric plant on both incan descent and arc lights were on the 8th day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety, well made and soldered, or have ever since been well made and soldered by the said plaintiff;\n3rd. Should said experts find that the plaintiff has failed to fulfil any part of said contract as to said steam plant, they are directed to state specially what part, how the defects they have found can be remedied and at what costs;\n4th Should said experts find that the plaintiffs have failed to make good joints in said electric plant, they are directed to say how many and in what they have so been found deficient, how the defects can be remedied and at what costs;\nThe experts made a unanimous report, declaring as follows '.\n\" We find that the contract was not satisfactorily completed on the eighth day of December, 1890, nor is it vet owing to certain defects existing which are hereinafter mentioned.\"\nThis is conclusive.\nIndependently of the first instalment of the contract price, the appellants, by their action, claim an additional sum of $5,331.99 for goods sold and delivered by the appellants to the respondents, for work done and freight and salaries paid by the appellants for the respondents, the whole upon the request and to the satisfaction of the latter, for their profit and advantage, in the City of Three Rivers, at the prices and times specified in the account produced in support of this claim, as exhibit No. 2 of the appellant.\nThe bill of particulars furnished by the appellants, comprises first the amount of the contract, $35,000; then follows a long series of items for articles which they had agreed to furnish under the contract, and which were used for the purpose of operating the plant, boilers, machines, tools, &c, forming part of the contract, which amount to $5,331.99. They claim the right to be paid this amount independently of the contract price. But these items being part of the contract, or being extras, this pretension cannot be admitted, on the principle that the plaintiff cannot claim any amount before the execution of the contract. These items, being only accessories of the contract cannot be made the basis of an action outside of such contract Moreover there is not sufficient evidence to justify a judgment granting the value to the appellant. True it was proved that this account was rendered to the respondents, and in part examined at an irregular meeting of some of the members of the council In addition to this there is the evidence of some of the employees, who stated that the goods were delivered and the work done. This evidence, which is not contradicted, would perhaps be sufficient in a separate action based solely on an account, but when a contract exists between the parties under which the appellants contract to furnish to the respondents, for $35,000, certain materials and work, evidence of delivery and value alone is not sufficient. It must be proved that these items are not included in the contract and are entirely outside of the contract. There is no such evidence of record. Moreover the bill of particulars comprising all these items as well as the contract price, show that the two form part of the same demand and the same contract, and cannot be considered separately the items of the account being only accessories of the contract.\nI concur entirely in the reasons given by the Hon. Mr. Justice Hall, in the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe appellants have no right, therefore, to claim the amount of their account inasmuch as the works were not completed when the action was brought. For these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Beique.

The original Contract with the city of Three-Rivers embraced conditions of which the defendants had no knowledge, and included the supply of other totally different plant from that which they subsequently undertook to supply to the appellants. The appellants, upon completion of the works having sued the city of Three Rivers for the agreed contract price, the city pleaded that the work was not completed, and set up defects in the steam engine and boilers and the appellants there upon brought an action en garantie simple against the respondents.\nHeld, affirming the judgments of the courts below that there was no legal connexion (connexit\u00e9) existing between the contract of the defendant and that of the plaintiffs with the city of Three Rivers upon which the principal demand was based and therefore the action en garantie simple, was properly dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Three Rivers which dismissed an action in warranty by appellants against respondents, in connection with the preceding case of The Royal Electric Company v. The City of Three Rivers\nThe plaintiffs by their declaration alleged that they had fulfilled all the greatest part of obligation of their contract since the 8th 1ecember 1890 and offered to complete those works which remained to be done concluded by praying for $33,000. the amount of the first instalment of payment under the contract.\nThe respondent pleaded that no right of action lay on behalf of the appellants until, 1st, they had fulfilled all the undertakings of their contract and had the works in satisfactory operation for thirty days, and 2nd, that with reference to any dispute under the contract the plaintiff was bound before instituting any action to submit the matter to arbitration.\nAfter a long enqu\u00eate the court, with the consent of the parties referred the case to experts, who were to report, and did report inter alia:\n1. Whether the plaintiff hid on the 8th of December 1890, or ever since, substantially fulfilled its part of said contract as to quality, capacity, installation and saving of fuel of said steam plant;\nQuestion answer to the first question submitted by the interlocutory judgment of the twenty-first day of May last past.\nWe find that the contract was not satisfactorily completed on the eighth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety, nor is it yet, owing to certain defects existing which are hereinafter mentioned\n\"a. Quality:\u2014We find the quality of materials used throughout to be good and to fulfil contract, hut the workmanship to be defective in some points.\n\" b. Capacity:\u2014We find the capacity of steam plant to be up to guarantee and to fulfil contract, when existing defects as hereinafter mentioned are remedied\n\" c. Installation:\u2014(Setting up). We find the installation good and to fulfil contract. However, from evidence taken we find that the engine foundations were defective on the eighth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety but have since been repaired and are now in good condition. \" d. Saving of fuel:\u2014We find that as regards saving of fuel the steam plant fulfils the contract.\"\n2nd. \"Whether the joints in the said electric plant on both incandescent and arc lights, were on the eighth day of December, 1890, well made and soldered or have ever since been well made and soldered by the plaintiff;\"\n\" Question 2nd. To the second question submitted by said judgment: \"\n\" Joints:\u2014We find from evidence taken that on the eighth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety the joints in both incandescent and arc lights were not well made and soldered, but that they have since been and are now all well made and soldered.\"\nBe\u00efgue Q.C. for appellant: The whole question at issue on this appeal is as to whether there is any connection at all between the contract forming the basis of the main action and the contract forming the basis of the action in warranty. For if any such connection exists, to whatever small extent it may be, we respectfully submit that the judgments appealed from are clearly unfounded.\nBy their contract with the corporation of the city of Three Rivers, appellants undertook to supply them \" with a steam and power plant consisting of two com pound condensing engines of a total capacity of 250 indicated horse power,\" and \" with four boilers of a total capacity not less than of 300 indicated horse power,\" and to \" set up said engines and boilers and properly connect the same.\"\nRespondents admit and allege in their plea, \" that defendants en garantie (to wit, respondents) by their contract with plaintiff en garantie (to wit appellants) agreed to furnish two Leonard Ball Automatic cut-off Tandem compound engines of a certain determinate kind as therein set forth, and to be respectively of 100 and 150 horse-power, the material and workmanship to be of the very best throughout and the working parts of large and substantial proportions.\"\nRespondents also undertook to furnish four boilers of the dimensions indicated in the specifications which dimensions imply a capacity exceeding 300 indicated horse-power, and \" to set up the said engines and boilers and connect the same with a steam \"pipe furnishing the necessary pipe and fittings, and make an Al plant in first-class running order \"\nNow, after respondents had furnished and made the installation of the engines boilers and steam pipe connections, appellants having sued the town of Three Rivers for, amongst other things, the price of said engines, boilers and steam pipe connections, they are met with a plea on the part of the said town to the effect \"that the engines, boilers and other material used and supplied by the plaintiff in the making of said plant are not of the power, quality and capacity required by the contract, and are badly connected together; that the shafts of said engines, are not of proper thickness, nor first-class in material or workmanship; that generally said engines, boilers and accessories composing said plant, are defective, badly made and of inferior quality.\nHow can the connection between the contracts be made more apparent ? The obligation to furnish a first-class steam plant being common to both contracts; and the respondents knowing at the time of the contract the purpose for which such plant was intended. If the principal defendants succeeded in proving the above allegations, appellants would suffer damage from the non-execution of respondents' undertaking, and would have recourse against the latter. They therefore have an action in warranty. Respondents' whole argument is that the requirements of the two contracts are in some respects different, and that non-compliance with the one contract is quite consistent with compliance with the other. But the fact that respondents are not liable in warranty on the matters wherein the contracts differ, does not prevent such liability with respect to the matters wherein said contracts agree. So long as the principal defendants allege defects amounting to a breach of both contracts the action in warranty arises so far as such defects are concerned, and such right of action is not impaired by any additional allegations with regard to matters with which respondents have nothing to do. Appellants have recognized this distinction in their action m warranty, as they ask respondents to warrant them only against such allegations as refer to defects in material and workmanship on engines, boilers and steam connections.\nJ. A. Oughtred for respondents: The two contracts were perfectly separate and distinct. No communication was ever had by the respondents of appellants' contract with the city of Three Rivers, and it was not stipulated in any way that respondents should be Tesponsible for the performance of any part 01 appellants' contract with the city of Three Rivers. A perfect compliance by respondents with the conditions of their contract with the appellants might be a very imperfect fulfilment of the requirements of the contract between appellants and the city of Three Rivers. Indeed, it would appear that the city of Three Rivers complains of the type of engines furnished, and considers it unfit for the performance of the work required by the contract with the appellants.\nWe urge that there is no such connexit\u00e9 between the principal action and the action in warranty as would justify a judgment granting the motion to unite them for purposes of evidence. And further, that there is no such connexit\u00e9 between the two contracts as would justify the action in warranty at all\nThe principle which has been laid down by the authors and confirmed by the courts in France whence our law as to the actions in warranty is derived clearly Justifies the judgments which have been rendered in the Superior Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench in this cause. That principle is fully expressed in the following quotations:\nGuyot, Repertoire ([1]); Delzers ([2]); Pothier ([3]); Dalloz ([4]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The appellants have appealed to this court from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench rendered at Quebec, confirming unanimously a judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed the appellants' action in warranty.\nBy a contract entered into between the appellants and the city of Three Rivers on the 17th May 1890 the appellants undertook to supply to the said city the necessary plant for lighting the said city with electricity, the contract price being $35,000.\nThe respondents, who are manufacturers of engines and boilers were requested by the appellants to tender for two stationary engines and foui boilers, with their connections, to be set up in the city of Three Rivers. On the 19th May a tender was submitted by the respondents, accompanied by specifications of the engines and boilers and their connections and was accepted by the appellants, after some modifications. This tender forms the contract between the parties.\nThe appellants, claiming to have completed their contract with the city of Three Rivers, brought an action against the said city to enforce payment. To this, action the city pleaded that the appellants had not fulfilled the conditions of the contract and it complained of the quality of the electric light plant, as well as of the engines and boilers supplied to the appellants by the respondents.\nThe appellants then brought an action in warranty against the respondents, citing the pleas of the city of Three Rivers, and alleging that by law the respondents were bound to warrant them against all portions of the defence of the city which urged the insufficiency and defects of the engines and boilers, with the exception of the warranty to effect a saving of 30 per cent of the consumption of fuel. They concluded by praying, that the respondents he ordered to intervene in this action, and that they be condemned to guarantee the appellants against that portion of the pleas of the city of Three Rivers, which complained of the quality of the engines and boilers, which should be dismissed; and in default of so doing, that the respondents be condemned to indemnify the appellants against any condemnation which might be rendered against them.\nThe respondents filed a declinatory exception, which was dismissed and which is not now in issue.\nThey also pleaded that they were not parties to the contract between the appellants and the city of Three Rivers; they had nothing to do with the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the obligations arising out of that contract, which formed the basis of the principal action, and that they were not in any way responsible for those works.\nBy their last plea the respondents alleged that by their contract with appellants, they agreed to supply two Leonard Ball Automatic Cut-off Tandem Com pound Engine$ of a certain determinate kind, the size of the cylinder wheels and of the governor wheels, of the main journals and crank pins was also specified and a list of the fixtures was attached to the tender.\nThey also agreed to furnish four stationary boilers for brick work of specified dimensions, and in con formity with the Montreal boiler by-law and in addition thereto the necessary steam pump, tubular pressure heater, smoke, flue and connections, for the price mentioned in their letter of 17th June, 1890, the condensers, however, were to be supplied by appellants.\nThey also alleged that they carried out their contract according to its terms, and according to the instructions of the appellants during the construction of the said works.\nThey endeavoured to show that the work done by them was well done, and had none of the defects alleged by the appellants. It is not necessary to follow this contention. The first question to be decided is whether there was a legal warranty. If the respondents are not warrantors by law there being no conventional warranty it is quite useless to discuss the manner in which the works were executed.\nit is clear that the contracts in question have no connection with one another. They are two acts, entirely distinct and separate one from the other, containing no condition of warranty in favour of the appellants. As the Hon. Mr. Justice Burgeois said in his judgment \" there is no connection between the contract entered into between the plaintiffs in warranty and the corporation of the city of Three Rivers, and the contract between the defendants in warranty and the said plain tiffs in warranty.\"\n\"Connexit\u00e9 c'est le rapport et la liaison qui se trouvent entre plusieurs affaires qui demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par un seul et m\u00eame jugement ([5]).\" \" Il y aura connexit\u00e9 si les points \u00e0 juger ressortent des m\u00eames faits, s'ils reposent sur l'interpr\u00e9tation des m\u00eames actes, s'ils d\u00e9pendent des m\u00eames moyens, si la d\u00e9cision rendue sur les uns est de nature \u00e0 influencer la d\u00e9cision des autres ([6]).\"\nPothier, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, defines a warranty, simple or personal, as follows:\nCelle qui a lieu clans les actions personnelles qui r\u00e9sultent de l'obligation qu'une personne a contract\u00e9e d'acquitter quelqu\u2019un en tout ou en partie d'une dette dont il est tenu envers un tiers et qui a lieu toutes les fois qu'il est poursuivi pour cette dette.\nIt follows from this definition that if the respondents are in any way responsible, it can only be as warrantors then how could they be in a direct action of damages ?\nSee also the case of Robert de la Marche v. Deveille, Cours d'Appel-Orl\u00e9ans ([7]).\nQu'en effet, en mati\u00e8re de garantie simple, le garant est celui qui se trouve tenu vis-\u00e0-vis d'une personne de r\u00e9ponde des suites d'une action qui lui est intent\u00e9e par un tiers; qu'il faut donc pour pouvoir appeler en garantie, que la demande principale et la demande en garantie se rattachent l'une \u00e0 l'autre par une relation n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9pendance et de subordination; que la base des deux actions ne doit pas consister en deux obligations de nature diff\u00e9rente; que ce n'est qu'autant qu'il en est ainsi qu'on peut invoquer la connexit\u00e9 existant entre les deux causes et la contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 possible des d\u00e9cisions.\nSee also La Compagnie l'Industrie Nationale y. Lemaire ([8]).\nThese authorities clearly show that the respondents are not warrantors of the appellants; the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Beique, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for respondents : Hutchinson & Oughtred.\n[1] Vo.

The defences set up were that the alleged obstruction was upon the street when it was dedicated to the public and the dedication should be held to have been accepted subject to such obstruction; also that the defendant, if the building had to be removed, was entitled to compensation as owner or occupier under the Municipal Act and the plaintiffs had not paid nor offered such compensation nor referred the matter to arbitration. The Supreme Court of the North-west Territories affirmed the decision at the trial in favour of the town holding that the defendant was not entitled to compensation as the land had not been \"entered upon, taken or used by the corporation in the exercise of its powers of appropriation\" which forms the only ground for compensation provided by the Municipal Act. As to the dedication being accepted subject to the obstruction the court held that such ground had not been taken at the trial and could not be entertained by the full court.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada also affirmed the decision in favour of the town, holding that the right of the public to the free and unobstructed use of a street could not be taken away by the existence of an obstruction when the street was dedicated.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nFerguson Q.C. for the appellant.\nLatchford for the respondents.\n*NOTE:\u2014The complete text of the decision Brown v.

It appears that seven, other persons were in like manner and at the same time in possession of other lands adjoining the land of which the said Colin Fraser was so in possession. On the 9th of February, 1881, the said Colin Fraser by an agreement in writing signed by him, agreed to sell to one James McDonald \"all the right and interest of him the said Colin Fraser, in that part of his claim situate on the east side of his ploughing,\" and fronting on the main travelled road, which is described in the agreement as follows: \"Beginning at a point three feet east from my ploughing, and extending eastward along the main travelled road fifty (50) feet; thence northward parallel with the ploughing aforesaid one hundred (100) feet; thence westward to within three (3) feet of the ploughing aforesaid fifty feet; thence southward to the main road one hundred feet.\" And the said Colin Fraser thereby agreed to furnish to the said James McDonald a clear deed of the above described lots \"as soon as the government surveys thereof are made.\" Upon the same 9th February James McDonald transferred all his interest in the said piece of land to the defendants, Brown & Curry.\nThe main travelled road mentioned in the above description, the northern limit of which was made the southern limit of the piece of land above described, had then no defined width or boundaries, nor could it have any legally defined limits, as indeed appears from the very terms of the agreement, until the Government surveys should be made. The only road which then was there, was a \"trail\" which, as is alleged in the defendants' statement of defence, ran along what constitutes the centre line of what is now called Jasper avenue. At or about the same time as Colin Fraser agreed to sell all his interest in the above described piece of land to James McDonald, he in like manner agreed to sell all his interest in several other pieces of the land of which he was so as aforesaid in possession, to persons respectively named Oliver, Kelly, Sanderson and Lorby, Hogarth and Lauder, and his interest in all the residue of the said land of which he was so in possession to one Samuel Pritchard. In the year 1882 one Deane, a Dominion Land Surveyor, was employed by the Dominion Government to make a survey of what is called the Edmonton Settlement in the North-west Territory. Upon that survey he laid down on a plan the several pieces of land of which the said Colin Fraser and the six other persons in possession of lands adjoining the land of which he was so possessed, and in such plan the name of S. Pritchard is entered as the person in possession of the whole lot, which is on the plan numbered as river lot no. 10 of the Edmonton Settlement survey. This plan was, upon the 26th May, 1883, approved and confirmed under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act in that behalf.\nUpon this plan there is laid down with dotted lines the northern and southern limits of the road across the said river lot No. 10 and the other neighbouring lots. The surveyor's notes of survey have not been produced showing the width of the road intended to be designated by such dotted lines, but the plan is made upon a scale of twenty chains to an inch, and by the application of such a scale to the space between the dotted lines inclusive of the dots, it appears to exceed one chain. Now prior to the 1st of January, 1883, Pritchard had a survey and plan made for him of the whole of the said river lot no. 10, but divided into town lots wherein were represented the several pieces thereof which had been agreed to be sold by Fraser to divers persons as well as several other lots wherein the names of other persons were entered, presumably persons to whom Pritchard himself had agreed to sell such pieces. On this plan Jasper avenue is laid down as being of the width of eighty feet, and another street called Fraser avenue extending northerly through the lot from Jasper avenue. Upon the plan the name of Brown is entered upon a lot designated on the plan as being fifty feet in width, abutting on the northerly limit of Jasper avenue, and extending in a northerly direction 100 feet the south-westerly angle of which lot is placed as being 119 feet easterly from the south-easterly angle of the street called Fraser avenue, that is from the intersection of the easterly limit of Fraser avenue with the northern limit of Jasper avenue. This survey and the plan thereof were made by Geo. A. Simpson, a [Deputy Land Surveyor, as and for a \"subdivision of river lot no. 10.\" \"Pritchard estate,\" and it is called \"Plan a,\" \"Edmonton,\" and was registered upon the 15th of March, 1886, under the provisions of the Northwest Territories Registration of Titles Ordinance, 1884, as appears by a copy certified by the registrar. Up to this time no patent had issued for any part of the said river lot no. 10, but on or about the 25th January, 1886, the before named Oliver, Kelly, Sanderson and Lorby, Colin Fraser, Hogarth and Lauder and the defendants, Brown and Curry signed under their respective hands and seals, a petition to the Minister of the Interior wherein, alleging themselves to be severally entitled to different portions of river lot number 10 in Edmonton according to the Dominion Government survey, which different portions compose in the whole the lands embraced in an accompanying description and shewn on an accompanying plan, they requested and consented that letters patent should issue for the whole of the lands so embraced in such description, and plan, to John Brown, of Edmonton, in the District of Alberta, in the Northwest Territories of Canada, Merchant, as trustee, and they requested that the patent should be forwarded to Mr. Robert Strachan, Edmonton, Solicitor.\nUpon the 27th January, 1886, Mr. Strachan forwarded this petition to the minister with statutory declarations made by Colin Fraser and James McDonald respectively, in the former of which Fraser declared that the above named parties were all the persons who were applying for patent to issue to John Brown, that he had not sold any of the said lands for which the patent was so applied for to any person, that any other sales he had made were entirely distinct from the lands described in a description accompanying his declaration, that the piece described as his own was a piece he had previously sold to, but afterwards purchased from James McDonald, who in his declaration confirmed this latter statement, and also declared that the lot marked on the accompanying plan \"J. Brown\" was purchased by him from Fraser and subsequently sold to John Brown and D. S. Curry, and he also declared that the description accompanying the declaration did not in any way encroach upon the lands of the Rev. Samuel Pritchard. This petition and the plan, descriptions and declarations accompanying the same, together with the letter of Mr. Strachan of the 27th January were received in the Department of the Interior on the 11th February, 1886, and in reply thereto a letter from the department to Mr. Strachan was addressed and sent upon the 16th March, 1886, wherein Mr. Strachan upon behalf of the petitioners was informed that \"before any further consideration could be given to the matter of the petition a tracing of a plan to be prepared as thereinafter stated, must be filed in the department, and that upon the receipt of such tracing the question as to the propriety of issuing patents direct to the several parties who purchased parts of the lot in question from Mr. Colin Fraser for their respective portions thereof, will be further considered.\" The directions given for further preparation of the required plan were as follows: \"1st. It must show river lot 10 as it is shown on a plan of the survey of the Edmonton Settlement made by Mr. Deane, a Dominion Land Surveyor. 2ndly. It must be prepared by a Dominion Land Surveyor on a scale of one chain to an inch and be certified in the usual manner by such surveyor; 3rdly. It must have indorsed on it a certificate of the registrar of the district to the effect that it is a record in his office; 4thly. The tracing to be filed in this department must be certified by the said registrar to be a true and correct copy of the above mentioned plan.\"\nIn accordance with these directions, Mr. Strachan on behalf of the petitioners had a plan prepared by Geo. A. Simpson, the Dominion Land Surveyor, who in 1882 had surveyed and made the plan for Mr. Pritchard. This plan which bears date the 18th of August, 1886, and is designed \"A. 1,\" and was duly certified by the said Geo. A. Simpson and registered in the registry office on the 28th August, 1886, was forwarded to the Department of the Interior, and upon it were marked the boundaries of the several lots which had been sold by Colin Fraser to all others than to Pritchard. The lot so as aforesaid sold to J. McDonald and by him transferred to the defendants, Brown & Curry, was designated by the letter \"P,\" and the dimensions, location and boundaries thereof were laid down precisely in the same manner as the lot whereon the name of \"J. Brown\" was laid down on the plan prepared by the same surveyor for Mr. Pritchard in 1882, and the said street called Jasper avenue was laid down as being eighty feet wide. After receipt of this plan by the Department of the Interior, a letter was addressed and sent by the department to Mr. Strachan informing him that the tracing of lot no. 10 in the Edmonton settlement referred to in the above letter of the 16th March, 1886, had been duly received, and that patents for the several portions of the lot were then in course of preparation in favour of the respective owners as shown on the tracing in question with the exception of that for lot \"P\" in favour of John Brown and D. S. Curry, which was stayed pending the receipt by the department of information giving Mr. D. S. Curry's Christian name in full. This information having been supplied, the said lot designated by the letter \"P\" was granted, by letters patent dated the 22nd day of April, 1887, to the defendants John Brown and Duncan Steel Curry, their heirs and assigns as tenants in common by the following description:\n\"All that parcel or tract of land situate, lying and being in the Edmonton Settlement in the Northwest Territories, in our Dominion of Canada, and being composed of lot lettered \"P\" as shown on a plan of the subdivision of a portion of the lot numbered 10 in the Edmonton Settlement aforesaid filed in the Department of the Interior signed by George A. Simpson, Dominion Land Surveyor, dated the 18th day of August, 1886, and registered in the registry office for the Edmonton District on the 28th day of August, 1886, the said lot numbered 10 in the Edmonton Settlement being shown on a plan of the said settlement signed by Andrew Russell for the Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, and dated 25th May, 1883.\" Letters patent to the other petitioners granted upon and in accordance with the designation and description of their several portions as the same appeared upon the said plan, under the designation of lots lettered respectively \"A,\" \"F,\" \"P,\" \"R,\" \"S,\" \"T,\" \"V,\" and, upon the 31st day of August, 1887, letters patent were granted to Mr. Pritchard of all that portion of said river lot no. 10 coming within the following description: \"All that parcel or tract of land situate, etc., etc., in the Edmonton Settlement, etc., etc., being composed of river lot number 10, in the Edmonton Settlement aforesaid, as shewn upon a plan of the said settlement, signed by A. Russell for the Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, dated 25th May, 1883, and of record in the Department of the Interior, containing by admeasurement eighty-one acres, more or less, saving and excepting thereout the following portions particularly described as follows:\u2014\"1st. A portion containing eight and seven-tenths acres abutting on the most northerly limit of said river lot number ten (particularly describing it by metes and bounds)\"; \"2ndly. The portions or lots indicated: and specified by the letters \"A,\" \"F,\" \"V,\" \"P,\" \"R,\" \"S,\" \"T,\" etc., etc.. shewn on a plan of a portion of the said river lot number 10, Edmonton Settlement, of record in the Department of the Interior, signed by Geo. A. Simpson, D.L.S., and duly certified to be a correct copy of a plan of part of lot numbered 10, registered in the registry office in and for the Registration District of Edmonton, in the Provisional District of Alberta, in the Northwest Territories, at two o'clock, p.m., on the 28th day of August, A.D. 1886, and signed by George Roy, Registrar.\"\nNow the piece of land designated above by the letter \"A\" is that which on the above plan A, made by Geo. A. Simpson in 1882 for Mr. Pritchard, and of a portion of which the plan \"A,\" which is the one mentioned in the above letters patent, is a facsimile, is designated as belonging to Mr. Oliver above mentioned; that marked letter \"F,\" is the lot which on the Pritchard plan is marked as belonging to Hogarth; that marked \"V,\" is the lot numbered 40 on the Pritchard plan; that marked with the letter \"P\" is the one marked in the Pritchard plan as belonging to J. Brown, (the plaintiff of that name); that marked with the letter \"R\" is that upon which the name of Sanderson is entered in the Pritchard plan; that marked with the letter \"S\" is the lot upon which in the Pritchard plan the name of Kelly is entered, and that marked with the letter \"T\" is part of the piece upon which, in the Pritchard plan, is entered the name of Lauder, all of which persons were the petitioners in 1886 for letters patent to be granted to them. Now of these pieces of land the lot \"P,\" as above granted to the defendants, and the lots designated by the letters \"R,\" \"S,\" and \"V,\" abut for their southerly boundaries upon the northern limit of the street called Jasper avenue, as shewn on the Pritchard plan and the plan mentioned in the letters patent, in accordance with which plan the lots were granted; and the pieces marked respectively with the letters \"A\" and \"F\" are lots the northern boundaries of which abut upon the southerly limit of the said Jasper avenue, as shewn on said plans. It is obvious therefore that the space marked upon the plan as Jasper avenue in accordance with which plan alone the lots abutting on that street are granted, was dedicated by the Crown as and for a street or public highway, to no part of which can the plaintiffs or any other persons, grantees of lots abutting upon the street, assert any claim whatever. The fact that the terms of the letters patent to Pritchard are such as to convey to him the whole of the river lot 10, except the excepted parts, can make no difference, for even though it should be held that the soil of what is designated as Jasper avenue on the plan in accordance with which his letters patent were granted, passed to him by his said letters patent, it could only so pass as subject to the public easement of being used as a street and public highway which being situate within the Municipality of the Town of Edmonton, is subject to the jurisdiction of the said municipality by ch. 8 of the Revised Ordinances of the Territories, and having such jurisdiction, the municipality, there can be no doubt, are entitled to maintain the present suit. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe case of Fisher v. Prowse[2], relied upon by the defendants was a case very different from the present. The question there was whether a cellar flat of the defeud ants' house which although being in the foot walk of a public street had existed in the same condition as far back as living memory went, was unlawful, and so subjected the defendant for maintaining it to liability for injury sustained therefrom by a person using the footwalk, and it was held that it must be presumed that an erection made so far back was lawfully erected and that the dedication was made subsequently and subject to the right to maintain the erection. In the present case there is no pretence of the defendants having ever had any right as against the Crown to erect and maintain the log house which obstructs the public street in front of the lot \"P\" granted by the Crown to them, for about one-third of its width. The defendants obtained their letters patent for their lot \"P,\" having its boundaries precisely as shown in Pritchard's plan \"A,\" made in 1882, and precisely as the defendants had in 1886 petitioned that it should be granted. They obtained the only title they have to their lot according to a plan which \"shows the southerly limit of the piece of land granted to them to be the northerly limit of a piece in front of their lot of 80 feet in width dedicated by the Crown as and for a public street. To hold that in such case it is to be presumed that the dedication by the Crown was subject to the right of the defendants to maintain an obstruction which when erected by them was so erected without any right whatever in law, would be, in my opnion, a perversion of common sense.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: S.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, and Sedgewick J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nExecutors and trustees\u2014Accounts\u2014Jurisdiction of probate court\u2014Res judicata.\nA court of probate has no jurisdiction over accounts of trustees under a will, and the passing of accounts; containing items relating to the duties of both executors and trustees is not, so far as the latter are concerned, binding on any other court, and a court of equity, in a suit to remove the executors and trustees, may investigate such accounts again and disallow charges of the trustees which were passed by the probate court.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, on appeal from a decision that the said charges were properly disallowed, will not re-consider the items so dealt with, two courts having previously exercised a judicial discretion as to the amounts and no question of principle being involved.\nA letter written by a trustee under a will to the cestuis que trust threatening in case proceedings are taken against him to make disclosures as to malpractices by the testator, which might result in heavy penalties being exacted from the estate, is such an improper act as to call for his immediate removal from the trusteeship.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, reversing the ruling of the judge in equity on exceptions to a referee's report.\nThe defendants, the Grants, were executors and trustees under the will of John W. Nicholson, who had been a wholesale liquor dealer in the City of St. John, N. B. The plaintiffs were children of said Nicholson, and beneficiaries under the will. Being dissatisfied with defendants' management of the estate plaintiffs had endeavoured to get R. C. Grant to resign his position as executor and trustee and have one of themselves appointed in his stead, and in answer to a letter proposing this change J. McGregor Grant wrote to the plaintiff, Mrs. MacLaren, a letter containing the following threats:\n\"If I chose to retaliate, as you richly deserve, I could put the Dominion Government in possession of information which would justify them, either now or at any time within fifty years, in seizing the books and property of the estate, and leaving you all simply paupers with the reputation of the family irretrievably ruined, and the public astonished with a revelation of over twenty years of the moss successful fraud, not only on the Government but on themselves as customers. The question has often been put to me: How has Mr. Nicholson accumulated such a large fortune when other liquor dealers could not? I and four others in St. John could answer that question, and could tell how night after night the shutters of the store would be put up, the door carefully locked and barred, all lights extinguished except on the lower story, all chinks in the windows covered over, the nuts cautiously taken off the copper hasps of the customs bonded warehouse, the doors opened, cask after cask rolled out, one-fourth of the contents transferred to empty casks ready in the duty paid warehouse, the quantity abstracted replaced with alcohol water and colouring mixture, the adulterated casks marked with chalk on the chine, rolled back into the bonded warehouse and afterwards sold to the public, and the Government defrauded of the duty on the quantity abstracted. Every cask that came into the store, whether of brandy, whisky, wine or gin, was treated in this manner, and the profit on every quarter cask averaged $25, and the invoice books in my possession will show that the estate is liable to the Dominion Government for nearly $300,000, or in other words, the duty on one fourth of every cask of liquor imported;\"\n\"I am not desirous of attempting to injure you as you have attempted to injure me; fortunately none of my family were ever engaged in the liquor traffic, and therefore any exposure, although it might be intensely gratifying to the St. John public, would be harmless to myself and family, but you can see that your own selfishness and base ingratitude may at any time place you in an unfortunate position, and so serious is the offence in the eyes of the law that had the particulars been divulged in the lifetime of your father it would have cost him his liberty. I do not intend that either of you, or any of your sisters, shall become trustees.\"\nAfter receiving this letter the plaintiffs instituted a suit in equity for the purpose of having the Grants removed from the trusteeship of the estate. At the hearing the judge in equity, without entering into the merits of the suit, ordered a reference to have the accounts of the defendants taken. \"When the case came before the referee defendants' counsel claimed that as the accounts had been passed every year before the Probate Court they could not be reviewed in the equity suit, but the referee proceeded to investigate them and disallowed a number of items as improper charges. On exception before the judge in equity to the referee's report that learned judge held that the passing of the accounts by the Probate Court was final, and not open to review in another proceeding. On appeal from this ruling it was reversed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the report of the referee was confirmed. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nMcLeod Q. C. and Palmer Q. C., for the appellants. The matter of the accounts was, by the action of the Probate Court, res judicata, and could not be attacked in a collateral proceeding. Doe d. Sullivan v. Currey[1]; Cummings v. Cummings[2]; Harrison v. Morehouse[3].\nHazen for the respondents was stopped by the court.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral judgment). We do not think it necessary to hear the learned counsel for the respondents any further as we all think the appeal must be dismissed.\nI am of opinion that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction over the accounts in so far as the charges and disbursements of the defendants were incidental to their duties as trustees and not to their duties as executors. Therefore whatever the Probate Court may have determined with respect to the accounts of the trustees, as distinguished from those of the executors, was rightly held by the court below not to be binding on the equity court. The technical rule relied on by the appellant that a judgment cannot be attacked for want of jurisdiction in a collateral proceeding does not, it seems to me, apply to such a case. For this the case of Atty. Gen. v. Hotham[4] which was referred to by my brother Taschereau during the argument is a sufficient authority.\nThe exceptions to the referee's report were properly disallowed by the full court on the appeal to it from the equity judge who had allowed some of these exceptions. There being no res judicata binding on the referee it appears to me that we cannot now interfere so far as to reconsider the several items in the accounts which have been made the subject of exceptions for the purpose of ascertaining if the exercise of discretion by the referee, confirmed as it has been by the court on appeal, should be altered by this court. Two tribunals have already pronounced upon them and exercised a judicial discretion in the allowances made and no question of principle is involved. Certainly this court as a second court of appeal ought not to review the items of the account in detail in such a case as this. It is laid down in two recent cases in the House of Lords[5] that where two courts have concurrently decided a question of fact that tribunal will not review their decisions, and this principle of adjudication seems to me to apply still more strongly where the subject matter of appeal is one in which the courts appealed from have exercised a discretion as to amounts, not involving any question of principle, in allowances made in taking trustee's accounts.\nWith reference to the conduct of the trustees which has been dwelt upon by Mr. Hazen, it appears to me that Major Grant acted most improperly in writing the letter which is set out in the bill. The judge in equity ought to have removed Major Grant from, the trusteeship at once. A trustee who threatens to betray the interests of his cestuis que trust in the manner in which Major Grant did in the letter in question should not have been allowed to remain in control of the trust estate as that gentleman has been left up to the present time. I cannot understand how any court of equity, having regard to the relationship existing between trustees and cestuis que trust, especially where some of the latter were infants or married women (as i n the present case), could allow a trustee who had so far forgotten his duties as to write such a letter still to continue in the administration of the trust funds and property. Therefore, so far as the conduct of the trustee ought to have any influence on the questions involved in the exceptions taken to the referee's report, it must be decidedly unfavourable to the appellants.\nIf I were called upon to take the accounts over again, scrutinizing each item and thus reviewing the discretion exercised by the referee and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, I could come to no other conclusion than that arrived at by those tribunals.\nThe charges disallowed were excessive and improper. The payment of $1,500 a year as a salary to Ronald C. Grant for collecting rents, in addition to the allowance he was entitled to receive as a trustee under the will, was unjustifiable. The trustees were paid for performing the duties of their office and beyond that clerks were employed and a commission allowed to Charles Grant, another son of the appellant, for collecting the rents due to the estate. These charges indicate that there was generally extravagant expenditure.\nMy reason for making these observations is that the circumstances upon which I have remarked appear to me to afford good ground why we should not be astute in scrutinizing every item in the trustees' accounts which has been disallowed, and why we should adhere to the judgment of the court below as having been a reasonable and proper exercise of its discretion. Further, I think even if we were to take the accounts over again we ought to come to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in everything said by his Lordship. As to the letter written by Grant I can only say that, could I find words of condemnation stronger than those used by Mr. Justice Tuck I would employ them. I think what he said is exactly what these gentlemen deserve. It is this: \"The man who could write such a letter to ladies, his relatives, of whose estate he had control is not fit to be a trustee, and had the hearing been before me I would have dismissed J. McGregor Grant at once, without hesitation, and have ordered an account to be afterwards taken. A more cruel, I was about to say diabolical, letter, under the circumstances, could not have been written. Young ladies, without father or mother, are asking from Mr. Grant only that which they believe to be their right, and they are answered with an implied threat to blast the reputation of their late father, or if not that, then to make him appear contemptible in their eyes. It is a heartless letter, and unworthy of a gentleman.\"\nI think these men deserved fully what has been said and I concur with his Lordship that they should have been dismissed from their position as trustees, and disconnected from the estate, at the first opportunity given to the court. I can only say that I hope, for the sake of the administration of justice in New Brunswick, that these men will not be allowed to remain long as trustees of this estate.\nSEDGEWICK J\u2014I also concur, and I think that, considering the circumstances under which the reference was ordered, the appellants here are not the persons to avail themselves of the objections made.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant J.

J., allowing respondent, as one of the heirs of the late William E. Phillips, to redeem from appellant, properties purchased by him from Henry S. Phillips and the curator of the estate of Charles W. Phillips\nThis was an action en retrait successoral based on art. 710 C. C. instituted on the 12th January 1891.\nThe following is a brief abstract of the pleadings. The respondent by her declaration alleged that the late W. E. Phillips, by his will, constituted his five children, among whom are the respondent and Charles W. and Henry S. Phillips, his universal legatees, for equal shares.\nBy notarial deeds executed February 2nd, 1889, and February 26th, 1890, confirmed by other deeds and transfers sons seing priv\u00e9, Henry S. Phillips assigned to appellant his share in his father's estate.\nCharles W. Phillips having become insolvent and made an abandonment of his property the curator sold to appellant all the insolvent's assets including his share in his father's succession.\nAppellant not being a person entitled to succeed to the deceased, respondent was entitled to redeem the shares of her said brothers, acquired by appellant as aforesaid, and she offered to reimburse appellant whatever he might have given for such shares with all fair expenses (Joyaux co\u00fbts), after estimation (ventilation,) and prayed that she be entitled to exercise such redemption; that the true amount paid by appellant for the here ditary rights of C. W. and H. S. Phillips, with all fair expenses (loyaux co\u00fbts) be established by a (ventilation,) and that defendant be condemned to execute on being so reimbursed, a transfer to her of such hereditary rights, and in default of his doing so within the delay fixed that the judgment avail as such transfer. The appellant pleaded that by deed no. 8062 he had acquired an undivided -- interest in a specific immovable; and the deed no. 8063, though on its face an actual sale of the hereditary rights of H. S. Phillips, was really in the nature of a collateral security that in the partition of the estate appellant should obtain 1\/5 of the C\u00f4te St. Antoine farm or of the proceeds thereof. This was declared by deed no. 8064 executed by appellant and H. S. Phillips before the said notary February 2nd, 1889. After having thus acquired this 4- of said C\u00f4te St. Antoine farm appellant sold the same to Mrs. Beique, by deed of August 5th 1890, registered August 21st, 1890.\nBy deed of cancellation of date July 15th, 1889, the deed of declaration, no. 8064, of February 2nd, 1889, was cancelled, and it was stipulated that the deed no. 8063 should be deemed an absolute sale of Phillips' hereditary rights. This, however, was not meant to effect a sale to appellant of said hereditary rights, but as security to appellant for money he was about to lend H. S. Phillips, and anything importing a different intention was inserted by error.\nBy deed of December 4th, 1889, appellant acquired from H. S. Phillips, for $2,250.00, 1\/5 of the rents to accrue from May 1st, 1890, to May 1st, 1894, under an emphyteutic lease of lot 1753, St. Anne's ward.\nBy deed February 26th, 1890, H. S. Phillips transferred to appellant his undivided rights in the continuation by the city of Montreal, of the emphyteutic lease of said lot 1753, after May 1st, 1894.\nWhen appellant acquired the several above mentioned properties from H. S. Phillips, he offered respondent the benefit of such purchases which she refused.\nNone of the above deeds constituted a sale of H. S. Phillips hereditary rights or enabled appellant to take part m the partition of the W. E. Phillips estate. They were merely sales of the rights of H. S. Phillips in certain determinete immovables; the latter remaining owner of all his rights in his father's estate, less those transferred as above.\nAppellant bought the assets of C. TV. Phillips' estate to protect his rights as creditor of the latter, which he then was and still is\u2014The sale was authorized by a judge on the advice of the inspectors of the estate, and being a judicial sale is not subject to the redemption sought for.\nAt the trial it was proved: That when appellant sold to Mrs. B\u00e9ique the 1\/5 interest in the C\u00f4te St. Antoine property, he was the registered owner thereof. The deed was passed on the 5th and registered on the 21st of August 1890. The deed of sale and transfer no. 8063 never was registered against that property.\nThat when Charles W. Phillips became insolvent, and made a judicial abandonment of his property, the appellant who was one of the creditors made a tender for the assets; that the inspectors after having had the assets valued by Wm. Robb, respondent's attorney, recommended acceptance of the tender and a sale to appellant in accordance with its terms; that such sale was authorized by a judge and made by the curator in virtue of and agreeably to said authorization, and that after the settlement of the estate appellant still remained a creditor of C. W . Phillips.\nUpon the pleadings and the evidence the Superior Court ordered that a ventilation be made to establish what had been paid by appellant to H. S. Phillips and the estate of C. W. Phillips, and appellant was condemned on being reimbursed what he had so paid, with loyaux co\u00fbts and interest, to give respondent a notarial transfer of tie hereditary rights of C. W. & H. S. Phillips within 15 days of the homologation of the ventilation, and that on his default to do so the judgment would avail as such transfer. The Court of Review confirmed the judgment, B\u00e9langer J. dissenting, as to the C\u00f4te St. Antoine property.\nBeique Q. C. for the appellant.\nDriscoll and D. G. Bowie for the respondent.\nThe arguments of counsel as well as the principal authorities relied on are fully reviewed in the judgment of the court hereinafter given by: TASCHEREAU J. Appel direct par le d\u00e9fendeur d'un jugement de la Cour de Revision.\nAction par l'intim\u00e9e en retrait successoral de deux parts, dun cinqui\u00e8me chacune dans la succession encore non partag\u00e9e de feu W. E. Phillips vendues par deux de ses fr\u00e8res, coh\u00e9ritiers, Charles et Henry, an d\u00e9 fendeur pr\u00e9sent appelant. De toutes les nombreuses questions de droit que peut soulever une action de cette nature, la pr\u00e9sente cause n'en pr\u00e9sente que peu, et, comme nous en sommes unanimement venus \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9fendeur appelant n'a pas lieu de se plaindre du jugement qui ordonne le retrait demand\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, adoptant en leur entier les vues des savants juges qui ont opine dans la cause tant en Cour de Revision qu'en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, j'essaierai de dire aussi succinctement que possible le r\u00e9sultat de nos d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations et les motifs qui, plus particuli\u00e8re ment, nous y ont amen\u00e9s. Toutes br\u00e8ves que seront mes remarques (elles sont plus longues cependant que je croyais d'abord pouvoir le faire), le nombre d'autorit\u00e9s que nous avons d\u00fb parcourir avant d'en venir \u00e0 une solution d\u00e9finitive des diff\u00e9rents points soumis par les parties \u00e0 l'audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable La louveaut\u00e9, dans notre jurisprudence, des questions soulev\u00e9es, l'importance des int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu, l'habilit\u00e9 avec laquelle la cause nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise de part et d'autre le requ\u00e9raient. Toutefois le travail ardu que les pro cureurs r\u00e9ciproques ont apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la cause, et leurs recherches approfondies, je suss heureux de le constater, out pour beaucoup contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faciliter notre travail\nL'article 710 du Code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec, reproduction textuelle de l'art. 841 du Code Napol\u00e9on, a continu\u00e9 comme loi dans la province ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler le retrait successoral qui n'est que avec limitation exclusive \u00e0 la famille et aux coh\u00e9ritiers ce qu'on appelait dans l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais le retrait de biens\u00e9ance. Ce retrait en effet consistait dans la facult\u00e9 donn\u00e9e parla loi \u00e0 tons ceux g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement qui poss\u00e9daient par indivis de retirer la part vendue par leur propri\u00e9taire conjoint en remboursant le prix \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur ([1]).\nLe principal motif de cette l\u00e9gislation se trouve de nos Jours, et en France et dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans le d\u00e9sir de prot\u00e9ger les families contre l'intrusion des \u00e9trangers qui viendraient indiscr\u00e8tement s'immiscer dans le secret de leurs affaires et de les garantir contre la cupidit\u00e9 processive des acheteurs de droits successifs. Un partage \u00e0 l'amiable d'ailleurs, est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement possible, probable m\u00eame, entre parents. Tandis que si un \u00e9tranger a droit d'y \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9, il faudra presque toujours y proc\u00e9der en justice et subir les cons\u00e9quences d'une immixtion vexatoire dd\u00e9sagr\u00e9able, et peut-\u00eatre ult\u00e9rieurement ruineuse pour toute la famille ([2]). Et dans le cas o\u00f9 deux coh\u00e9ritiers seulement se pr\u00e9sentent le retrait successoral s'il v a vente par l'un d'eux, met fin absolue \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un partage op\u00e9ration toujours Si h\u00e9riss\u00e9e de difficult\u00e9s\nIl est admis, et par la doctrine et par la jurisprudence, et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en doute par le d\u00e9fendeur, que le retrait peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 aussi bien par voie d'action principale que par voie d'exception, et que l'action est imprescriptible et recevable tant que le partage n'est pas consomm\u00e9 entre les coh\u00e9ritiers ([3]). C'est une annexe de l'action en partage et elle est per p\u00e9tuelle comme elle ([4]).\nCelui qui voit son coh\u00e9ritier vendre sa part n'est pas tenu d'intervenir des lors pour prot\u00e9ger ce droit de retrait, et l'acheteur pourra lui-m\u00eame revendre, et cette revente an vu et s\u00e7u de ses coh\u00e9ritiers suivie d'une ou plusieurs autres, sans que leur d\u00e9faut d'agir leur fasse perdre \u00e0 tous indivis\u00e9ment ou \u00e0 chacun d'eux s\u00e9par\u00e9ment leur droit de retrayer la part que la premi\u00e8re vente, celle par leur coh\u00e9ritier, a fait sortir de la famille. Tous les sous-cessionnaires sont cens\u00e9s comme le premier avoir connu les droits des coh\u00e9ritiers de leur auteur et les risques de l'\u00e9viction. C'est un nuage sur le titre de chacun d'eux \u00e0 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le partage seul dissipera,\nIl suit de ce que nous estimons le droit le retrait r\u00e9el en partie (dit Dunod, ([5])) que le parent a le droit lorsque l'h\u00e9ritage a \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9 par l'acheteur pendant l'ann\u00e9e du retrait de l'exercer contre l'acheteur ou contre le possesseur actuel, \u00e0 son choix, (ce qui est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par notre coutume,) et cela quand m\u00eame l'h\u00e9ritage aurait pas\u00e9\u00e9 par plusieurs mains, et que le possesseur actuel le tiendrait \u00e0 titre lucratif.\nCe que l'auteur limite ici \u00e0 un an pour le retrait lignager s'applique pour le retrait successoral jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le partage alt eu lieu.\nJe citerai dans un instant d'autres autorit\u00e9s dans le m\u00eame sens.\nQue l'action dans l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle compete \u00e0 la demanderesse, ne peut \u00eatre mis en doute et de fait ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Que le d\u00e9fendeur lui ne soit pas successible, et que les deux fr\u00e8res de la demanderesse, Charles et Henry, qui lui out vendu les parts indivises dans la succession de leur pr\u00e9, auxquelles la demanderesse demande d'\u00eatre subrog\u00e9e soient ses co-successibles ne sont pas non plus des points contest\u00e9s. Que la vente par Charles, ou son curateur au d\u00e9fendeur fut et un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et une cession de tons ses droits dans cette succession est aussi incontestable. Que la vente par Henry an d\u00e9fendeur fut de m\u00eame une vente de tous ou d'une quotit\u00e9 de ses droits dans la dite succession qui puisse donner lieu au retrait, est un point qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en question par le d\u00e9fendeur, mais nous ne croyons pas, apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve et des documents produits, car c'est l\u00e0 une question de fait plut\u00f4t que de droit, qu'il y ait le moindre doute sur la justesse de la conclusion prise par la cour a quo sur ce point contre le d\u00e9fendeur. Je me contenterai de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer l\u00e0-dessus aux autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans Sirey, Code ann. ([6]); Fuz. Herm. Code ann. ([7]); au Vol. 13 Rev. de l\u00e9gisl. et de jurisp. art. par D\u00e9rome, o\u00f9 je trouve une savante dissertation sur la mati\u00e8re ([8]); \u00e0 Durocher v. Turgeon ([9]); et \u00e0 Leclere v. Beaudry ([10]); et Dutrue ([11]).\nUne autre objection prise par le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 l'action de la demanderesse dans son ensemble nous para\u00eet. enti\u00e8rement non fond\u00e9e. C'est celle par laquelle, invoquant la doctrine adopt\u00e9e par la Cour d'appel \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, in re Demers v. Lynch ([12]) qu'un vendeur \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 ne peut exercer le rachat avant d'avoir offert le prix convenu, il en argumente qu'ici la demanderesse,. n'ayant pas fait d'offres r\u00e9elles avant d'instituer son action, doit s'en voir pour ce d\u00e9bout\u00e9e. Le d\u00e9fendeur ici fait \u00e9videmment une fausse application de cette doctrine. Il n'y a pas de rachat demand\u00e9 par l'action de la demanderesse; c'est une simple subrogation aux lieu et place du d\u00e9fendeur, comme acqu\u00e9reur des deux. parts en question, que la demanderesse r\u00e9clame. Comme Hureaux ([13]) l'exprime en termes heureux tout cc que la demanderesse dit au d\u00e9fendeur dans une telle action c'est: \" Otes-toi de l\u00e0, que je m'y mette.\" Or la doc trine et la jurisprudence sont unanimes \u00e0 dire qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de faire pr\u00e9alablement des offres r\u00e9elles; il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant de se soumettre par sesconclusions \u00e0 l'obligation de mettre le retray\u00e9 indemne avant l'ex\u00e9cution du retrait comme elle l'a fait. Ceci dispose des objections prises par le d\u00e9fendeur contre l'action en son entier.\nJ'en viens maintenant aux points qui ne s'appliquent qu'\u00e0 l'une ou l'autre des deux parts en question.\nD'abord tant qu'\u00e0 celle de Charles. La seule objection que fait le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 l'encontre de la demande du retrait de cette part est bas\u00e9e sur ce qu'il l'a acquise du curateur, entre les mains de qui parait-il, Charles comme commer\u00e7ant, avait fait cession, en vertu des arts. 763 et seq. du Code de proc\u00e9dure sur l'autorisation du juge, voulue par l'art. 772. Une telle vente, dit-il, \u00e9quipolle \u00e0 une vente par d\u00e9cret, et n'est pas sujette \u00e0 retrait. Cette pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 reiet\u00e9e par la Cour Superieure, et par la Cour de Revision, et devait l'\u00eatre. Nous n'avons pas ici \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il v aurait lieu au retrait d'une vente faite sur une adjudication en justice ordinaire apr\u00e8s annonces, mise \u00e0 ench\u00e8re, et refus tacite par le \u00f3oh\u00e9ritier de se porter acqu\u00e9reur. C'est l\u00e0 une question peut-\u00eatre un peu douteuse; quoi qu'il me semble qu'en France la jurisprudence et la grande majorit\u00e9 des auteurs, admettent le droit au retrait m\u00eame apr\u00e8s une telle vente 11 en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame pour le retrait f\u00e9odal, Pocquet de Liv. des fiefs ([14]). Il est vrai que Dalloz, Repert. V. Succ. ([15]); ainsi qu'un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Paris ([16]); Huriaux des Succ. ([17]) et Demolombe 4 des Succ. ([18]) sont d'opinion contraire. Mais un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Lyon ([19]); Dutruc, Partage de succ. ([20]); Laurent ([21]); Fuz. Herm. Code ann. ([22]) admettent le retrait m\u00eame contre une adjudication en justice. L'art 150 de la Coutume de Paris le d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait formellement pour le retrait lignager; et malgr\u00e9 que cet article de la Coutume ait \u00e9t\u00e9 abro\u00edr\u00e9 par le Statut de 1855 c. 53 S. R. B. C. qui a mis fin au retrait lignager dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec il nous est permis comme on l'a toujours fait en France, et sous l'an cienne et sous la nouvelle jurisprudence de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux principes qui r\u00e9gissaient cette esp\u00e8ce de retrait, la ou, comme en mati\u00e8re du temps requis pour l'exercice du droit, par exemple, o\u00f9 les formalities \u00e0 suivre pour l'obtenir, il n'y a pas divergence compl\u00e8te entre les deux Pothier des Retraits ([23]); Bourjon, Dr. comm. ([24]); Bretonnier, sur Henrys ([25]) et Duplessis ([26]), admettent tous le retrait apr\u00e8s vente en justice. Quoique le d\u00e9cret soit public dit ce dernier, qu'il purge toutes les charges, et que les lignagers, aient la libert\u00e9 d'y ench\u00e9rir, n\u00e9anmoins le retrait lignager y a lieu . . . quoique le retrayant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'adjudication.\" Sur le m\u00eame principe, le Seigneur m\u00eame lorsqu'il s'\u00e9tait porte opposant au d\u00e9cret pour la conservation de ses droits, n'\u00e9tait pas exclus du retrait f\u00e9odal Pocquet de Liv. des Fiefs \u00cd4). Mais, je l'ai dit, nous n'avons pas dans l'instance \u00e0 prononcer sur cette question. Il n'y a pas eu ici une vente en justice o\u00f9 la demanderesse eut pu se porter adjudicataire Le d\u00e9fendeur a acquis du curateur les droits de Charles ni plus ni moins avec toutes les charges, hypoth\u00e8ques, conditions dont ces droits \u00e9taient grev\u00e9s ou auxquelles ils \u00e9taient assujettis. Or, une de ces charges ou conditions \u00e9tait que la vente de ces droits successifs indivis \u00e9tait sujette an retrait successoral en faveur de tous ou de chacun des coh\u00e9ritiers de Charles et cette condition que la loi attache \u00e0 toute vente de droits successifs ne peut dans un tel cas \u00eatre ignor\u00e9e des acqu\u00e9reuses de tels droits, tout comme si elle eut \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9e dans\n(5) P. 429. l'acte d'acquisition; ou du moins, cette ignorance ne les peut excuser. Le d\u00e9fendeur aux yeux d\u00e9 la loi est dans la m\u00eame position que s'il eut ach\u00e9e de Charles directement et sans l'entremise du curateur.\nNous concluons done, que cette objection du d\u00e9fendeur relativement \u00e0 la part par lui acquise du curateur aux biens de Charles n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nJe passe maintenant \u00e0 la part des droits de Henry; j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que nous concourons enti\u00e8rement avec la Cour \u00e0 quo sur la conclusion de fait et de droit, que cette vente au d\u00e9fendeur constitue une vente donnant droit au retrait. Il ne reste \u00e0 examiner qu'une seule objection prise par le d\u00e9fendeur contre la demande du retrait de cette part. Il a plaid\u00e9 et prouv\u00e9 que, des avant l'institution de l'action, par acte d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9, il a revendu \u00e0 Mde B\u00e9qu\u00e9, la part de Henry dans un certain immeuble, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la C\u00f4te St. Antoine, pr\u00e8s de Montr\u00e9al l et, de cc fait, il nous a demand\u00e9 de conclure, comme il l'avait fait en Cour de Revision, que, tant qu'\u00e0 cette part du moins, la demanderesse ne pouvait dans la pr\u00e9sent instance, en l'absence de Mde B\u00e9\u00efoue, obtenir jugement de retrait. Mais cette objection, qui de prime abord peut para\u00eetre s\u00e9rieuse, ne doit pas pr\u00e9valoir contre la demande de la demanderesse. Le d\u00e9fendeur n'invoque ici, ailleurs, il est \u00e9vident que les droits de Mde B\u00e9qu\u00e9, or, de quel droit, d\u00e9fend-il Mde B\u00e9\u00efque? N'excipe-t-il pas par l\u00e0 du droit d'autrui? N'invoque-t-il pas, uniquement, un jus tertti ? Inutile de nous dire comme il l'a fait, que tout ce qui sera d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause restera avec Mde B\u00e9\u00efque res inter alios acta, et ne peut en aucune maniere ill\u00e9galement pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 ses droits. C'est l\u00e0 une raison de plus contre son objection, etrien autre chose. Si la loi veut que le jugement qui accorde le retrait \u00e0 la demanderesse r\u00e9agisse contre elle comme possesseur d'une partie de ses droits, ii lui faudra s'y soumettre mais le tribunal ne lui dira, \u00e0 elle, que telle est la loi, que quand elle aura eu occasion de se d\u00e9fendre. Sans doute il e\u00fbt peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux pour la demanderesse de mettre Mde B\u00e9\u00efque en cause, sinon des le debut, du moins aussit\u00f4t la d\u00e9nonciation en justice de cette vente par le d\u00e9fendeur. Il y a des auteurs qui paraissent dire que c'est au d\u00e9fendeur dans un cas semblable \u00e0 d\u00e9 noncer la demande au d\u00e9tenteur. Pothier, des Retraits, nos. 189, 190, est d'avis qu'il est plus equitable que, soit par l'une on l'autre des parties, le d\u00e9tenteur soit appel\u00e9. Et les parties n'auraient certainement pu se plaindre il me semble, si, sous les circonstances, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l'e\u00fbt, ex propria motu, ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun \u00e9tage de la cause. Mais puisque la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire, puisque la Cour de Revision ne l'a pas non plus fait devrions-nous main tenant le faire ? Le d\u00e9fendeur si je l'ai bien compris, a cru voir l\u00e0 une raison pour nous demander sinon le renvoi entier de l'action du moins d'en soustraire \u00e0 son effet, par une disposition expresse, cette partie poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par Mde B\u00e9\u00efque. Mais la loi repousse cette demande. Je citerai quelques extraits d'aueeurs pour d\u00e9montrer quelles sont les consid\u00e9rations que nous ont plus particuli\u00e8rement guides sur cette partie de la cause.\nMais avant d'en venir l\u00e0, je ferai remarquer qu'il est evident que la demanderesse devait n\u00e9cessairement demander le retrait des deux parts acquises par le d\u00e9fendeur tant de celle de Charles que de celle de Henry: en demander qu'une e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 une absurdit\u00e9. Le but essentiel du retrait successoral, je l'ai dit, c'est d'\u00e9carter l'acheteur du partage, \"banquet dont chacun des convives a de droit de chasser les intrus qui pour raient troubler la f\u00eate ([27]).\" Or, il est evident que ce but serait loin d'\u00eatre atteint, si la demanderesse, n'avait pas dirig\u00e9 son action, comme elle l'a fait, tant contre la vente de la part de Charles que contre la vente de la part de Henry ([28]).\nD'apr\u00e8s des principes, le retrayant prend la place du retrav\u00e9 in omnibus et per omnia, et la demanderesse a droit \u00e0 une subrogation complete an lieu et place du d\u00e9fendeur tant qu'\u00e0 ces deux parts. Le retrait a un effect r\u00e9troactif comme si, \u00e0 la date m\u00eame des acquisitions du d\u00e9fendeur, elle-m\u00eame cut achet\u00e9 les parts de ses deux coh\u00e9ritiers, \" qui retrahit p\u00e9rin\u00e9e est ac si emisset ab ipso venditore etprimus emptor p\u00e9rin\u00e9e habelur ac Si non emisset.\" Et cons\u00e9quemment, toutes ventes, ali\u00e9nations, charges et hypoth\u00e8ques faites ou cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le d\u00e9fendeur de ou sur ces parts ou aucunes parties d'icelles s'\u00e9vanouissent. Pothier, des Retraits ([29]) Bourjon ([30]); Hureaux ([31]); Demolombe ([32]); Aubry et Rau ([33]); Laurent ([34]); et la note du rapporteur Royneau ([35]); Huc. Code Civil ([36]); Bretonnier sur henrys ([37]).\nLes acquisitions de ces parts par le d\u00e9fendeur sont r\u00e9solues ab initio et r\u00e9duites ad non actum ad non causam ([38]), ou plut\u00f4t, il n'y a ni r\u00e9solution, ni annulation de ces acquisitions, non plus qu'une r\u00e9trocession, mais une pure subrogation ([39]), la simple substitution de la demanderesse \u00e0 lui, le d\u00e9fendeur, neque eniw non contrartus, sed legalis translatio de person\u00e2 in personam ([40]); et le retrait peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la mort du coh\u00e9ritier vendeur ([41]). Par le retrait l'acheteur \"primitif est \u00e9cart\u00e9 tout comme s'il \u00e9tait parfaitement \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration. C'est une. n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il subit, et \u00e0 laquelle nolens volens il lui faut se soumettre. Il en est comme s'ii n'avait jamais acquis, dit Dunod, des Retraits, ([42]). Il ne peut gu\u00e8re s'en plaindre d'ailleurs 11 n'est pas pris par surprise; car en achetant des droits successifs, la loi a inscrit dans son acte d'achat une r\u00e9serve non \u00e9quivoque de ce droit en faveur des coh\u00e9ritiers de son vendeur collectivement et individuellement. Et des que ce droit est exerc\u00e9 il est cens\u00e9 n'avoir jamais lui-m\u00eame eu de droits sur la chose, et n'a pu, cons\u00e9quemment en conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 d'autres ([43]) sa possession \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d'un vice d'organisme h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire, et le titre qu'il a pu transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 un tiers souffre in\u00e9vitablement de l'infirmit\u00e9 du sien\nCe sont l\u00e0 les principes qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re, et qu'il nous faut affirmer sur le litige entre la demanderesse et le d\u00e9fendeur. Si, par ricochet, pour me servir d'une expression de D\u00e9mol\u00eemes, notre d\u00e9cision r\u00e9agit contre Madame B\u00e9\u00efque, c'est l\u00e0 une cons\u00e9quence de la loi que nous ne pouvons pas emp\u00eacher.\nIl nous est permis d'esp\u00e9rer d'ailleurs que ces remar ques auront peut-\u00eatre pour effet de mettre fin \u00e0 tout litige sur cette succession, malgr\u00e9 que notre d\u00e9cision ne pussse \u00eatre res judicata taut qu'\u00e0 Mde B\u00e9\u00efque. C'est l\u00e0 un des motifs qui nous a fait renoncer \u00e0 remettre le dossier \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, afin de la mettre en cause, comme nous avions d'abord pens\u00e9 le faire. Nous avons cru que loin d'obtenir le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9sir\u00e9 nous aurions peut-\u00eatre par l\u00e0 prolong\u00e9 le litige. C'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 d'ailleurs refuser \u00e0 la demanderesse un jugement contre le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9fendeur auquel elle a un droit ind\u00e9niable. Si par la suite, ne f\u00fbt-ce que par un retard prolong\u00e9 ou les d\u00e9sagrements d'un nouveau proc\u00e8s, elle souffre de l'absence de Mde B\u00e9\u00efque dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, elle ne devra s'en prendre qu'\u00e0 elle-m\u00eame.\nLe defendeur a \u00e9mis la proposition que comme il n'a revendu \u00e0 Mde B\u00e9\u00efque, qu'une partie d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, d'un des immeubles de la succession il n'y a pas lieu au retrait pour cette partie, et il nous a demand\u00e9 de reformer pour ce motif, le jugement de la Cour de Revision qui lui a refus\u00e9 d'exempter du retrait demand\u00e9 cette partie de cet imneuble. Mais cette proposition est enti\u00e8rement erron\u00e9e et la demande sur laquelle elle est bas\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Il lui suffiratt donc d'apr\u00e8s lui, d'avoir revendu le tout des parts par lui acquises a soit cinq personnes diff\u00e9rentes, cliacune pour une part d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, pour enlever \u00e0 la demanderesse son droit de tetrayer le tout. Mais telle n'est pas la loi. Le droit au retrait serait bien illusoire s'il en \u00e9tait autrement, et Si of pouvait si facilement d\u00e9jouer les coh\u00e9ritiers. Seulement, dans un cas semblable, il faudrait voir sur qui diriger la poursuite. En fait de retrait lignager lorsqu'un seul immeuble \u00e9tait en question, l'action, d'apr\u00e8s certains auteurs, pouvait, ignorant compl\u00e8tement l'acqu\u00e9reur primitif, \u00eatre divis\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9tenteur seul, soas-cessionnaire. Mais pour le retrait successoral, lorsque, comme c'est le cas ici, l'acheteur primitif a revendu seulement une part d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d'une chose de la succession, et que le reste des droits successifs est encore entre ses mains la demanderesse doit n\u00e9cessairement diriger sa demande contre lui, avec libert\u00e9 d'y appeler le d\u00e9tenteur de la part revendue, si elle le juge \u00e0 propos.\nMaintenant, dans un cas pareil c'est-\u00e0-dire, si entre l'achat et le retrait, l'acheteur a revendu \u00e0 un sons-acqu\u00e9reur, ce quil a pu, en loi, parfaitement faire, s'il v a une diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de cette revente et celui de son propre achat, quel est le prix qu'aura \u00e0 rembourser le retrayant ?\nCe sera comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le jugement dont estappel, le prix de la premi\u00e8re vente, de celle faite par le coh\u00e9ritier du retrayant ([44]); Il y a des autorit\u00e9s au contraire entre autres Dtruc ([45]) Laurent ([46]) et un arr\u00eat en 1857 de la Cour de Besan\u00e7on r\u00e9 Dautriche([47]); Mais le sentiment contraire a pr\u00e9valu, et nous l'adoptons avec le jugement \u00e0 quo ([48]). L'action en retrait, dit Le Caron, sur la Coutume de P\u00e9ronne ([49]); \" Dolt \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9tenteur possesseur toutes fois il ne faut payer que les deniers du premier achat.\" Et Loysel, dans ses Institutes Costumi\u00e8res ([50]); dont les savants commentateurs Dupin et Lab\u00f3laulage ([51]) disent en parlant de ses ceuvres \" Ce n'est pas de la th\u00e9orie, de la divination, de la conjecture, c'est le droit lui-m\u00eame, tel que nos p\u00e8res l'ont connu et pratiqu\u00e9,\" Loysel, dis-je, s'exprime en termes bien clairs comme suit: \" Le retrayant n'est tenu de payer que le prix, frais et loyaux co\u00fbts de la premi\u00e8re vente, ores que la chose alt march\u00e9 en beaucoup d'autres mains pendant l'an et jour du retrait.\" \" Et, ajoutent ses commentateurs, s'il en \u00e9tait autrement, l'acqu\u00e9reur pourrait en revendant \u00e0 un autre empirer la condition du retrayant, ce qui serait injuste.\"\nEt Dunod dit ([52]).\nMais la seconde alienation est a titre on\u00e9reux, de laquelle est-ce que le retrayant remboursera le prix ? Il semble que ce doit \u00eatre celui de la premiere, parce que c'est .celle qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au retrait. La question de savoir si nue part dans nne succession indivise peut \u00eatre saisie et vendue en \"justice a \u00e9t\u00e9 agit\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience. La demanderesse a soutenu que non, et a appuy\u00e8 ses pretentions sur la doctrine adopt\u00e9e en France par 1 art. 2205 du Code Napol\u00e9on ([53]) Le d\u00e9fendeur a r\u00e9pond que cet article ne se trouvait nulle part dans les Codes de Qu\u00e9bec, et que telle saisie et vente, \u00e9tait parfaitement l\u00e9gale dans la province. Il y a sans doute une contradiction apparente entre le principe du droit successoral et la saisie d'une part indivise d'une succession, mais je ne vois pas l'\u00e0-propos dans cette cause de cette discussion. Ici il v a eu vente d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e des droits successifs de Charles, par le curateur. Le d\u00e9fendeur s'y est porte acqu\u00e9reur. Je ne vois l\u00e0 rien d'ill\u00e9gal. Y eut-il nullit\u00e9 ce ne serait au plus qu'une nullit\u00e9 relative dont le d\u00e9fendeur ne pourrait certainement pas se pr\u00e9valoir. Il ne pourrait lui \u00eatre permis d'invoquer la nullit\u00e9 de son propre titre pour repousser la demande de la demanderesse. Et tant qu'\u00e0 la demanderesse, loin de demander la nullit\u00e9 de cette vente, elle demande d'y \u00eatre subrog\u00e9e. Le d\u00e9fendeur a dit \u00e0 l'audience et r\u00e9p\u00e8te dans son factum, que si une vente par un curateur comme celle en question est soumise au retrait. successoral, les cr\u00e9anciers en souffriront, parce qu'il est \u00e9vident que l'on trouvera rarement des acheteurs dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 un tel risque. Mais il y a une r\u00e9ponse bien conclusive il me semble \u00e0 cette objection. C'est que les cr\u00e9anciers, an lieu de proc\u00e9der comme l'ont fait ceux de Charles Phillips, peuvent eux-m\u00eames provoquer le partage, pour ensuite faire vendre la part adh\u00e9rant \u00e0 leur d\u00e9biteur. Les autorit\u00e9s sont unanimes \u00e0 leur reconna\u00eetre ce droit. Puis un acheteur de bonne foi dune part ndivise de droits successifs est s\u00fbr que, si un retrayant se pr\u00e9sente, il n'obtiendra la subrogation qu'\u00e0 la charge de le rendre pr\u00e9alablement parfaitement indemne.\nDeux autres questions d'importance secondaire ont \u00e8t\u00e8 soulev\u00e9es par les parties. La premi\u00e8re vient du d\u00e9fendeur qui a pr\u00e9tendu, quoique faiblement, il m\u2019ait sembl\u00e9, que la demanderesse avait perdu son droit an retrait demand\u00e9 pour y avoir tacitement renonc\u00e9, ou avoir refuse sur offres \u00e0 cet effet, de reprendre du d\u00e9fendeur la part par lui acquise de Henry. C'est l\u00e0une question de fait, et nous disons sans h\u00e9siter, avec la cour dont est appel, qu'iln'y a pas au dossier de preuve suffisante pour soutenir cette objection.\nLa seconde vient de la demanderesse. Elle dit avoir \u00e0 se plaindre du jugement de la cour inf\u00e9rieure sur une intervention produite dans la cause par Henry Phillips, son coh\u00e9ritier vendeur, en ce que, tout en renvoyant cette intervention, la cour n'a pas condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur aux frais. Il me suffira de dire que nous avons maintes et maintes fois d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que nous n'interviendrions jamais sur une d\u00e9cision tant qu'aux frais en cours inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 moins de circonstances bien sp\u00e8ciales dont nulles se rencontrent ici.\nJ'ajoute maintenant aux autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9es celles applicables g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que j'ai rencontr\u00e9es dans l'\u00e9tude de la cause. Elles sont principalement tir\u00e9es, on le verra, des auteurs sur le droit lignager. Le mot de droit successoral est ignor\u00e9 dans l'ancien droit Fran\u00e7ais, m\u00eame dans Boujon, o\u00f9 un passage que je cite le d\u00e9crit cependant en termes non \u00e9quivoques. Mais les regles des retraits en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont les m\u00eames Et comme le dit Labb\u00e9, loc. cit.:\nNous trouvons souvent beaucoup \u00e0 puiser dans des trait\u00e9s sur des institutions aujourd'hui supprim\u00e9es. Par exemple, le retrait lignager est aboli, n\u00e9anmoins, les solutions donn\u00e9es par nos anciens auteurs sur les effets de ce retrait, peuvent nous servir \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre des questions semblables s'\u00e9levant de nos jours \u00e0 propos do retrait successoral, du retrait de droits litigieux et du retrait d'indivision. Ce sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des droits de m\u00eame nature et produisant les m\u00eame cons\u00e9quences.\nEt le savant professeur ajoute Qu'il adopt\u00e9e pour son guide sur le droit successoral le trait\u00e9 de\" Tirageau sur le retrait lignager.\nEt D\u00e9mol\u00eemes, ([54]) dit dans le m\u00eame sens que l'on est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 invoquer en mati\u00e8re de retrait successoral, l'application des principes qui gouvernaient les retraits en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral daus l'ancienne jurisprudence. Cette doc trine est d'ailleurs g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise.\nBourjon ([55]): \u2014\nLorsqu'un premier acqu\u00e9reur a vendu \u00e0 un second le retrait quoique r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant sur le second acqu\u00e9reur \u00a1s'exerce n\u00e9anmoins sur le premier contrat de vente et non sur le second. C'est ce contrat qui a fait ouverture au droit des lignagers.\"s\nEt \u00e0 la page 1056 et seq:\nNonobstant, la vente faite par un premier acqu\u00e9reur d'un propre .... (sujet au retrait) la demande en retrait doit toujours \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre lui, premier acqu\u00e9reur, parce que c'est par son contrat d'acquisition que l'h\u00e9ritage propre est sorti de la famille. On va voir par les propositions, suivantes, les autres formalit\u00e9s d'un tel retrait et l'effet qu'il a contre le second acqu\u00e9reur, ce qui est fond\u00e9 sur ce que l'action en retrait est mixte, que cette action d\u00e9rive du contrat fait avec le premier acqu\u00e9reur contre lequel il y a une personnalit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il est toujours demeur\u00e9 sujet\nMais ce premier acqu\u00e9reur n'\u00e9tant plus en 'possession de l'h\u00e9ritage pour lequel il est assign\u00e9 en retrait, doit d\u00e9norcer la demande form\u00e9e contre lui et s'il n\u00e9glige de faire cette d\u00e9nonciation, cette negligence ne nuit pas an retrayant qui peut ignorer cette vente, et qui n'est oblige d'agir que contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur; cependant si le second acqu\u00e9reur et son droit sont connus du. retrayant il peut pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le mettre en cause pour voir dire que la sentence qui interviendra contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur sera d\u00e9cal\u00e9e commune avec lui i mais encore une fois, l'omission de sa part de la d\u00e9nonciation de la demande en retrait par lui form\u00e9e ne donnerait aucune atteinte \u00e0 son droit qui milite contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur et qu'il a pleinement conserve par la demande qu'il a form\u00e9e contre lui. Il en serait de m\u00eame s l'acqu\u00e9reur pendant l'an du retrait (retrait lignager) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 de l'h\u00e9ritage par un d\u00e9cret poursuivi sur lui \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de ses cr\u00e9anciers. La publicit\u00e9 de ce d\u00e9cret ne change point le droit du retrayant qui est toujours fonde \u00e0 dire qu'il ne conna\u00eet que le premier acqu\u00e9reur; il peut donc encore dans ce cas, se pourvoir et agir contre lui nonobstant l'adjudication faite de l'objet du retrait. Dans l'un comme dans l'autre cas, le retrait adjuge, ne s'ex\u00e9cute que contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur il est n\u00e9anmoins prudent mais non de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, de d\u00e9noncer cette ex\u00e9cution au second acqu\u00e9reur, comme on la d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit par rapport \u00e0 la demande, ce qui influe sur l'ex\u00e9cution qu'on examine ici n'ayant encore examin\u00e9 que la demande, et s'il y a diff\u00e9rence de prix la garantie d\u00e9pend des circonstances. L'ex\u00e9cution d'un tel retrait \u00e9tant faite avec le premier acqu\u00e9reur, et cc dans le cas qu'on examine, c.-\u00e0-d. lorsqu'il y a eu de sa parte vente de l'h\u00e9ritage (pendant l'ann\u00e9e du retrait lignager) cette ex\u00e9cution milite contre le second acqu\u00e9reur contre lequel il suffit par la suite et sans autres formalit\u00e9s que celles des instances ordinaires, de demander qu' attendu l'ex\u00e9cution du retrait la sentence d'adjudication d'icelui soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e commune avec lui, ce qui \u00e9tant jug\u00e9, la sentence d'adjudication s'ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e contre lui mais il faut cette forme pour l'ex\u00e9cution r\u00e9elle, autrement ce ne serait plus agir par les voies de la justice, mais militairement.\nPothier, des Retraits, n 17:\nL'action est personnelle r\u00e9elle, car la loi en formant cette obligation en la personne de l'acheteur \u00e9tranger, affecte en m\u00eame temps l'h\u00e9ritage par lui acquis \u00e0 l'accomplissement de cette obligation. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cet h\u00e9ritage ne lui est transf\u00e9r\u00e9e que sous la charge du retrait, et il ne peut par cons\u00e9quent le transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 d'autres que sous cette charge. Nemo plus juris in alium transferre potest quam ipse habet. C'est pourquoi cette action tant que le temps du retrait dure peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e par les lignagers ron seulement contre cclui qui a achet\u00e9 de leur parent mais contre ceux a qui l'h\u00e9ritage a pu passer depuis, et qui s'en trouvent en possession.\nEt au n\u00b0. 26 '. l'action est personnelle r\u00e9elle, in rem scripta) et elle suit le possesseur.\nNo.189:\nLorsque cet acqu\u00e9reur \u00e9tranger avant que la demande en retrait ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e contre lui, a ali\u00e9n\u00e9 l'h\u00e9ritage sujet au retrait, il est au choix du lignager de donner la demande en retrait contre cet acheteur ou contre le tiers. Cette action est une action personnelle r\u00e9elle qui nait de l'obligation ex quasi contractu que l'acheteur \u00e9tranger contracte en acqu\u00e9rant envers les lignagers de c\u00e9der son marc\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 celui d'entre eux qui le voudra prendre et de lui d\u00e9laisser l'h\u00e9ritage; c'est a lac- complissement de Cette obligation personnelle que la loi aff\u00e9cte l'h\u00e9ritage. Cette action, comme personnelle pent donc \u00eatre intent\u00e8e contre l'acheteur \u00e9tranger, qui est le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9biteur, et qui n'a pas Pu par son fait en ali\u00e9nant l'h\u00e9ritage, se d\u00e9charger de l'obligation qu'il a contract\u00e9 de le d\u00e9laisser au lignager qui voudra exercer le retrait. Cette action peut aussi comme r\u00e9elle \u00eatre intent\u00e9e directement contre le tiers d\u00e9tenteur de l'h\u00e9ritage; cet h\u00e9ritage \u00e9tant affect\u00e9 par la loi \u00e0 l'accomplissement de l'obligation.\nEt au paragraphe 190, Pothier dit que lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur assign\u00e9 en retrait plaide qu'il a revendu \u00e0 un tiers, il est \u00e9quitable de renvoyer le demandeur \u00e0 se pourvoir contre ce tiers (ceci dans le cas de retrait lignager o\u00f9 il ne s'agit que d'un immeuble particulier, et d'une revente de tout ce que comprenait la premi\u00e8re vente.)\n8. Pothier, Introd. 2 Gout. d'Orl\u00e9ans, p. 651:\nMais, si l'un des enfants avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 sa portion \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger il est permis aux autres d'exclure l'\u00e9tranger du partage en lui remboursant le prix de sa cession. (Bourjon, Vol. 1, page 1032). Et dans son chap. sur le retrait lignager il dit, page 1032: \"dans le cas que le vendeur a des co-h\u00e9ritiers et que par consequent la vente n'embrasse qu'une portion de la succession, chaque co-h\u00e9ritier a droit le retirer le tout lorsque la vente est faite \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger et tel retrait n'est sujet \u00e0 aucunes formalit\u00e9s et est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable au retrait lignager.\"\nC'est bien l\u00e0 le retrait successoral.\nFerri\u00e8re sous art. 129 de la Gout, de Paris, dit.\nL'action (en retrait lignager) peut \u00eatre intenit\u00e9e contre celui qui se trouve d\u00e9tenteur de l'h\u00e9ritage an temps de l'action, ou contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur, suivant la disposition de cutume de Reims et quelques autres: mais dans celles qui n'en parlent pas, il semble que l'action doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9tenteur d'autant que les conclusions du retrait ne peuvent \u00eatre form\u00e9es contre celui qui ne poss\u00e8de plus.\nL'auteur ici traite d'une action en retrait lignager contre un immeuble distinct et s\u00e9par\u00e9.\nDuplessis ([56]):\nQuand l'acqu\u00e9reur a revendu l'h\u00e9ritage \u00e0 un tiers ... il faut distinguer s'il a fait la revente depuis l'assignation en retrait \u00e0 lui baill\u00e9e; en ce cas le retrayant se peut toujours adresser \u00e0 lui parce qu'il ne l'a Pu faire au pr\u00e9judice du proc\u00e8s et du vice du litige. Mais s'il a fait cette revente avant qu'il y cut encore aucune demande en retrait, alors c'est au nouvel acqu\u00e9reur et dernier possesseur de l'h\u00e9ritage que le retrayant doit en faire la demande, parce que c'est actio in ' rem scripta. Et en l'un et l'autre de ces cas, il ne doit pas rembourser davantage que le prix de la premiere acquisition, sauf en second acqu\u00e9reur son recours contre le premier pour le plus qu'il lui a pay\u00e9. Mais on demandera si dans le second cas, le retrayant est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment contraint de s'adresser au dernier acqu\u00e9reur seulement, sans avoir l'option de convenir le premier car v\u00e9ritablement d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 on dira que l'action du retrait, \u00e9tant in rem scripta ne peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e que contre le possesseur; et que pourrait-on prononcer contre le premier puisqu'il ne tient plus la chose, que s'il en a dispose il l'a Pu n'y ayant point encore eu d'action intent\u00e9e contre lui. D'autre part on r\u00e9pond que l'action de retrait \u00e9tant mixte, et provenant d'un contrat-fait avec le premier acqu\u00e9reur il y a de la personnalit\u00e9 a laquelle il a toujours demeur\u00e9 sujet . . . c'est pourquoi je tiens, qu'en ce cas, le retrayant a le choix de s'adresser au premier ou an second acqu\u00e9reur et ne sert de rien de dire que puisque le premier ne poss\u00e8de plus, on ne pourra mien prononcer contre lui car par l'action on fern r\u00e9soudre son droit par o\u00f9 celui de son acqu\u00e9reur sera aussi r\u00e9solu, et de fait on demeure bien d'accord, qu'on y prononce au premier cas.\nGrand Coutumier de France.

Salterio (Plaintiff)\nAppellant\nAnd\nThe City of London Fire Insurance Company (Defendants)\nRespondents.\n1893: Nov. 28; 1894: Feb. 20.\nPresent:\u2014Founder, Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nFire insurance\u2014Condition against assigning policy\u2014Breach of condition.\nA condition in a policy of insurance against fire provided that if the policy or any interest therein should be assigned, parted with or in any way encumbered the insurance should be absolutely void unless the consent of the company thereto was obtained and indorsed on the policy. S. the insured under said policy assigned, by way of chattel mortgage; all the property insured and all policies of insurance thereon and all renewals thereof to a creditor. At the time of such assignment S. had other insurance on said property the policies of which did not prohibit their assignment. The consent of the company to the transfer was not obtained and indorsed on the policy.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the mortgage of the policy by S. without such consent made it void and he could not recover the amount insured in case of loss.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment for defendants at the trial.\nThe action in this case was on a policy of insurance against fire on plaintiff's stock, dated April 1st, 1890. One of the conditions of the policy was as follows:\u2014\n\"Condition no. 5.\u2014If, during this assurance, any change takes place in the title to or possession of the property described in the policy, or in the event of any change affecting the interest of the assured therein, whether by sale, legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer or conveyance of any kind, or if the assured is not the sole and unconditional owner of the property insured, or of the premises in or upon which the same may be situate, or has not such more limited interest in the property insured or in the premises in or upon which the same may be situate, as may be described in the application for the policy and approved by the company, or if the policy or any interest therein be assigned, parted with, or in any way encumbered, or if possession of the premises becomes vacant by removal of the owner or occupants, then and in every such case this insurance shall be absolutely void, unless the consent thereto of the company in writing shall have been obtained and indorsed hereon.\"\nOn September 6, 1890, the plaintiff executed a chattel mortgage of all his said stock so insured \"and all policies of insurance on the said stock and premises and all renewals thereof\" to Gault, Bros. & Co., of Montreal. At the time the said mortgage was given plaintiff held policies of insurance on said stock in other companies which contained no such condition as the one set out above.\nPlaintiff's stock having been destroyed by fire the solicitors of Gault, Bros. & Co. notified the local agent of the defendant company that their clients held the policies and were the persons entitled to the insurance. The company having refused payment an action was brought on the policy which resulted in favour of the company. The decision of the trial judgment having been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in banc the plaintiff appealed to this court.\nHarrington Q.C. for the appellant. The mortgage of policies must be held to apply to those which Salterio could assign and not to this as to which an assignment is prohibited. Lazarus v. Commonwealth Insurance Co. [1] Newcombe Q.C. for the respondents referred to Credland v. Potter.[2]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J\u2014The condition relied upon by defendant as a defence to the action declares (inter alia) that if the assured shall assign, part with, or in any way encumber the policy or any interest therein, without the consent of the company indorsed on the policy, the policy shall be void. Prior to the loss the assured made a chattel mortgage to Messrs. Gault Bros, assigning and transferring all his stock in trade (the property covered by the insurance in question) and \"also all policies of insurance on the said stock and premises.\" He held at the time several policies of insurance in one or more of which there was no condition against assigning or encumbering such policy or policies.\nMr. Harrington argued, upon the authority of Lazarus v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.[3], that the assignment should be limited to such of the policies as contained no restraint upon assignment, upon the ground that it would be insensible for the mortgagor to destroy his security under the policy, as neither he nor the mortgagee could derive any advantage from it. He also contended that the assured could not be said to have assigned or encumbered the policy when the policy did not admit of such assignment or encumbrance being made effectual except upon a condition that was not performed. But I conceive that what is meant by the condition is that the policy shall be voidable by the insurance company upon breach of the condition, and the Messrs. Gault had, by the assignment and encumbrance, the legal possibility of advantage through the chance of the company's consent being given. The encumbrance was effectual so far as Salterio was concerned, and might be entirely an effectual security by the company electing not to avoid the policy. Unless the clause of the policy operates to render voidable what but for it would be a valid assignment or encumbrance it is difficult to see what it can mean. Here there was the transfer of the insured property by way of mortgage, and the transfer by way of mortgage of the assured's interest in the policy and the policy itself, and this seems to me to be an encumbrance of the policy or of an interest therein within the meaning of the condition.\nThe assigning or encumbering clause \"also all policies of insurance on the said stock and premises,\" in its natural meaning embraces this policy, and there is nothing to show that the intent was otherwise; on the contrary the attorneys of Messrs. Gault, the virtual plaintiffs, a few days after the loss wrote the following letter to the agent of the company, clearly implying that, in Messrs. Gault's view at least, this policy had been transferred under the chattel mortgage and requesting that consent be then given.\nJanuary 2nd, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014We beg to inform you that all policies of insurance which James W. Salterio holds on the stock-in-trade owned by him and consumed by fire in the Globe Hotel building on Wednesday night, were assigned by him to Gault Bros. & Company of Montreal, by chattel mortgage dated 18th day of October, 1890. The mortgage contained a covenant to insure the goods for our client's benefit. It is true that we did not get the policies assigned by indorsement thereon made with your assent, but if that is necessary it can be done now after the loss. At present we simply wish to notify you of our client's rights and that they are the persons entitled to the insurance, their interest being upwards of nine thousand dollars.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd. HARRINGTON & CHISHOLM,\nAttorneys of Gault Bros. & Co.\nTo Alfred Shortt, Esq.,\nAgent of City of London Insurance Company. In May on Insurance[4], it is said that:\u2014\nAn assignment of a policy as collateral security avoids a policy which stipulates against an assignment in whole or of any interest in it under penalty of forfeiture.\nIn such case the words \"or of any interest in it\" have been held in the courts of the United States to extend to the transfer of the policy by way of security. The words of this policy go further and extend in terms to encumbrances. There are the following general observations of the experienced writer just quoted with reference to the reason for the insertion of such clause:\u2014\nIncumbrances are objectionable, and are usually inquired after; for, as they increase, the interest of the owner of the property in its preservation diminishes * * * If the privilege of transferring the policy as collateral security for goods purchased or money borrowed tends to the increase of incumbrances the Company has a motive to prohibit it. That it does so tend is a matter of common experience.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Harrington & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Drysdale & McInnes.\n[1] 19 Pick. 81.\n[2] 10 Ch.

A porch had been erected on the same site in 1855 and removed in 1884; while it stood the portion of the street outside of it, and since its removal the portion up to the house, had been used as a public sidewalk; on the hearing of the petition the original line of the street could not be proved but the judge held that it was close to the line so used by the public and ordered its removal. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed his decision. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, that the evidence would have justified the judge in holding that the porch was upon the line but having held that it was close to the line while the petition only called for its removal as upon it, his order was properly reversed.\nAn objection was taken to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada on the ground that the petition having been presented to a judge in chambers the matter did not originate in a superior court.\nHeld, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the court had jurisdiction. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (16 Can. S.C.R. 606) and Virtue v. Hayes (16 Can. S.C.R. 721) distinguished. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment of a judge on the hearing of a petition by the city council to remove an obstruction on a public street.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note.\nA preliminary objection was taken by respondents counsel to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal the petition having been presented to a judge and thus, on the authority of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Therese[1], and Virtue v. Hayes[2], not having originated in a superior court.\nThe majority of the court were of opinion that there was jurisdiction, and the case was heard on the merits.\nMacCoy Q.C. for the appellants referred to Spackman v. Plumstead Board of Works[3]; The Queen v. Berger[4].\nNew combe Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014A preliminary question as to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal was dealt with by His Lordship the Chief Justice upon the argument, and the cases of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Therese (1) and Virtue v. Hayes (2) distinguished.\nThen as to the merits: The complaint is for erecting a porch upon the street line without first obtaining the certificate of the city engineer as to its location. To support this charge it is not necessary to prove that the building is beyond the line. The act makes it the duty of persons intending to build upon or close to the street line to apply to the city engineer to lay down the line. It is not to be taken that this refers to an intention to encroach. A building is upon the line of the street if the line of the building, in whole or in part, coincides with that of the street. A building encroaching on the street is likewise upon the line. The act extends also to buildings that are close to the street line, although not upon it. \"Close to\" is an approximate term and admits of more or less separation between the line of the building and the true line of the street. The object of the act is to provide that the street line may be authoritatively and conclusively settled by the city engineer, who in such matter acts as on a judicial inquiry. The defendant having been charged with building upon the line of the street without first making application for the engineer to lay out the line, it is for the city, as the plaintiff in the case, to prove that the building was upon, i.e., coincident with, or beyond, the street line. In the case of a street that has no recorded boundaries the determination of its line may depend upon the extent and nature of the public use and of the adjacent occupations. Here the porch, the erection of which is complained of, occupies the site of a porch built in 1855, and removed in 1884, the foundation of which was found covered with three feet of earth. During the time that the old porch existed the space outside of it was a travelled portion of the street, and since its removal the place where it had been was used as part of the sidewalk. The defendant says that before he put up the present porch the place where he put it was \"just like the rest of the sidewalk.\" Assuming that the defendant was entitled to the site of the old porch, the part outside of it was public street, and the line of the old porch coincided with the line of the street, and was therefore upon it, and upon the evidence the learned judge might very well have found this, and also that the porch complained of was upon such line.\nA difficulty, however, arises by reason of the finding that the porch was close to the line of the street, and that the exact line was not located. There may be implied in this an adjudication that the porch was not upon the line of the street, and as it is in respect of a wrongful building upon the line of the street, and not for a wrongful building close to the street, that the proceedings are instituted it would appear that the order complained of is open to objection, and that the judgment reversing it should be sustained. This appeal is therefore to be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In my opinion the objection raised by the respondent to our jurisdiction on this appeal is well taken, and I would quash the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W.

The sale was afterwards abandoned and the underwriters notified the ship's husband that she was not a total loss and requested him to take possession. He paid no attention to the notice and the vessel was libelled by K. for salvage and sold under decree of court. The uninsured owner brought an action against the underwriters for conversion of her interest.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the ship's husband was agent of the uninsured owner in respect of the vessel and his conduct precluded her from bringing the action; that he might have taken possession before the vessel was libelled; and that the insured owner was not deprived of her interest by any action of the underwriters but by the decree of the court under which she was sold for salvage.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside the verdict for the plaintiffs at the trial and ordering a non-suit.\nThe facts of the case are set out in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick, as follows:\u2014 This is an action on trover brought against the defendants for the alleged conversion of the plaintiff's interest in the schooner \"James Rourke\" a British vessel owned as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff Rachel E. Rourke, twenty-four shares; one E. V. Rourke, eight shares; Charlotte Rourke, wife of James Rourke, twenty-four shares; Ph\u0153be Rourke, eight shares. James Rourke, Charlotte's husband, was ship's husband as well as the particular agent of his wife and Phoebe Rourke in the insurance of their respective interests. The plaintiffs share and that of E. V. Rourke were uninsured. Charlotte and Phoebe's interests were insured in the defendant company.\nOn the 11th February, 1891, the schooner while on a voyage from Boston to St. John, New Brunswick, laden with phosphate, became stranded on a reef at North Haven, on the coast of Maine, about ten miles distant from the port of Rockland. The vessel was badly damaged and a telegraph message was sent to James Rourke the ship's husband. He lived at St. Martins near the city of St. John where the owners lived William and Edward being his brothers and Phoebe his sister; the plaintiff was at the time his clerk as well. James Rourke upon receiving the message left for St. John, saw the agent of the defendant company, informed him of the telegram received and that he believed the schooner was a wreck. On his arrival at Rockland, February l4th, he saw one Butler who was acting as the company's representative who had sent down a Mr. Bunker to look after the wreck. James Rourke on his arrival boarded the vessel and examined her condition. She had then been stripped of her rigging which had been brought on shore and placed in a building owned by one Ledbetter for safe keeping. Rourke remained near the scene until the 17th, three days, and then returned to New Brunswick and although ship's husband he left no directions as to the vessel, cargo or outfit nor did he take any means to save them. Upon his arrival at St. John on the 18th of February he saw the agent of the Insurance Company, told him about the position of the vessel and that in his opinion it was for the interest of all concerned better to leave her there, and afterwards, on behalf of his wife and sister, gave notice of abandonment and eventually was paid a large portion of his claim the question as to whether he was paid for a total loss being disputed by the appellants. After Mr. Rourke's departure the agent of the company appears to have advertised the sale of the vessel as she lay on the reef and her outfit, the outfit which was in Ledbetter's building being purchased by one Smith and the vessel by one Keene; the wreck and sails, however, seem to have come into Keene's possession, and subsequently the schooner was floated and brought to Rockland, a place of safety, where she could have been repaired, the sale in the mean time having apparently been abandoned although the evidence on this point is exceedingly obscure. Mr. Butler, the respondent's agent, on March 12th notified James Rourke, amongst other things, that she was not a total loss and requested him to come to Rockland, pay charges and take possession of the property. Neither the appellants nor James Rourke took any notice of this telegram nor did they do anything afterwards in the direction of taking the property or repairing the vessel. The vessel could not be kept afloat; she was put on the Marine Railway at Rockland and nothing being done Keene, who had succeeded in taking her off the rocks, commenced proceedings by way of libel in the United States District Court of Maine, setting out the facts above stated, and that he had incurred expense to the extent of $1,000 in salving the property, and asked that this amount might be paid him and that the vessel should be condemned and sold to pay the same. No defence was ever made by any person interested in the vessel to these proceedings, and eventually a decree of condemnation was made and the vessel was sold thereunder, the proceeds being paid into court and subsequently disposed of as by the decree ordered.\nSubsequently the plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant company to recover damages by reason of the company's action in selling the vessel and outfit while wrecked upon the reef at North Haven. The jury found a verdict in favour of the plaintiff which verdict was set aside by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick upon appeal, and a non-suit ordered to be entered pursuant to leave reserved at the trial.\nMcLeod Q.C. for the appellants referred to Shepherd v. Henderson[1]; Jacobs v. Seward[2].\nWeldon Q.C. and Palmer Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014(His Lordship stated the facts appearing above and proceeded as follows.)\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court is right. The action of the defendant company, in so far as its dealing with the interests of the assured was concerned, was perfectly proper under the \"sue and labour\" clause of the policy; it was within their authority to do all that they did do in respect to that interest; it was equally within their power to act as they did by reason of the abandonment to them of the assured's interest. At all events it is absolutely out of the question for the plaintiffs to deny the authority of the respondents. to act as they did, whether as the agents of the assured or by virtue of their having a right to take possession of the wreck upon her abandonment by James Eourke on behalf of the assured. The position of the company then was that of a joint owner with the plaintiffs' of the vessel in question, and the only question upon this appeal is, whether the acts of the respondents' agents amounted to a conversion of the plaintiffs' interests I am strongly convinced that the conduct of James Rourke, who, as ship's husband, was the agent of the plaintiffs in respect of this vessel, precludes the plaintiffs from bringing this action. If, as they contend, the vessel was not a total wreck, and could with advantage to the owners have been repaired and brought safely to port, his relationship to the plaintiffs as ship's husband most certainly had not ceased. It was his duty in their interest to have done everything possible to protect them. The evidence convinces me that he was perfectly satisfied that there was a total loss, and that it would be for the benefit of all concerned to let the insurance company deal exclusively with the wreck, I do not, however, wish to place my judgment upon this ground. The defendant company were in the position of co-owners with the plaintiffs of the wreck, and the question as to whether the alleged sale amounted to a conversion depends altogether upon what the result of that sale was. If the effect of it was to deprive the plaintiffs of their interest in the property, or to amount to a destruction of the property, so that under no circumstances could they in the future have any benefit from it, then, according to the authorities, a conversion would have been complete; but no such result followed from the sale in question; the effect of the sale was the very reverse; the assure d owners had abandoned the property; James Rourke, as agent of the plaintiffs, acted as if he had abandoned the property, but the purchasers at the sale saved it and brought the wreck to a place of perfect safety, where the plaintiffs might have come in less than a day and taken possession of it. The plaintiffs were in fact subsequently deprived of their right of possession, but not by reason of any sale of the property, but by reason of the decree of the United States District Court, the court having unquestionable jurisdiction, as respects this vessel, to decree her forfeiture and sale. If the plaintiffs now find themselves deprived of their interest in the vessel it is not through any action of the respondents, it is solely in consequence of the action of Keene claiming for salvage services in respect to the vessel, and their own inaction in not making their defence in the United States cours if he were not entitled to the decree he had obtained by reason of his not having rendered the salvage services upon whieh that decree was based. The authorities are numerous and the law is clear as to what constitutes a conversion by one joint owner against his co-owner. In Mayhew v. Herrick[3] it was decided that a mere sale of a property was not enough, though for such a disposition of a property as amounted to a destruction of it one tenant in common would be liable in trover to his co-tenant. In Jacobs v. Seward[4] the Lord Chancellor said:\nSo long as a tenant in common is only exercising lawfully the rights he has as tenant in common, no action can lie against him by his co-tenant. Now, it is perfectly lawful for a tenant in common to make hay, for somebody must make it, just as it is lawful for a tenant in common of a whale to make the blubber into oil. That is a perfectly legitimate purpose. It does not signify whether one or other of the tenants in common made use of it, it being made use of in an ordinary and legitimate way. No trover would, therefore, lie against the. co-tenant in respect of his having done what he did.\nThe cases in which trover would lie against a tenant in common are reducible to this. They are cases in which something has been done which has destroyed the common property, he seeking to exercise his rights therein, and being denied the exercise of such rights. There was the case of a ship being taken possession of by one tenant in common and sent to sea without the consent of his co-tenant. In that case it was held that the property was destroyed by the act of one tenant in common, and therefore trover would lie in respect of the co-tenant's share. But where the act done by the tenant in common is right in itself, and nothing is done which destroys the benefit of the other co-tenant in common in the property, there no action will lie, because he can follow that property as long as it is in existence and not destroyed.\nThe case referred to by the Lord Chancellor was Barnardiston v. Chapman cited in Heath v. Hubbard[5]. In that case the plaintiff was tenant in common of one moiety of a ship and the defendants tenants in common of another moiety. The defendants had forcibly taken the ship out of the plaintiffs' possession, secreted it from him, changed its name and afterwards handed it over to a third party who sent it on a voyage in the course of which it became a total loss. The jury having found that there had been a destruction of the vessel by the defendants' means the court refused to disturb the verdict. The law on the subject is well stated in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts[6].\nIf two or more people own a chattel either jointly or in common, one of them cannot bring an action against the others merely for an interference with his right of possession, since the possession of each is alike lawful, and the manner of its exercise is left by the law to be settled among the parties themselves. But if one co-owner has deprived the other of all possible use and enjoyment of the property, either in the present or the future, then he has been guilty of an act of conversion. It is well established that one tenant in common cannot maintain an action against his companion unless there has been a destruction of the particular chattel or something equivalent to it. Short, therefore, of \"destruction or something equivalent\" one co-owner may exercise the full rights of property over a chattel in defiance of the wishes of the other co-owners, without being guilty of a tort. He may destroy its identity by the process of manufacture, he may create a lien on it, he may sell it, and this immunity extends to those who stand in his shoes. If a sheriff seizes partnership property under an execution against one of the firm he becomes part owner, and this part ownership protects him, even though he purports to sell the entire interest in the goods. If co-owners jointly pledge property, and one of them without the authority of the other afterwards demands the property back tendering the amount due, the pledgee is not guilty of a conversion by refusing to deliver.\nIn the present case the company bad unquestionably the right for the protection of their own interests to take the cargo from the wreck, as well as her rigging and other appurtenances; they had equally the right, in their own interests, to restore the rigging and appurtenances to the vessel, with a view of saving her if possible. They had a right to employ parties, on their own account, to use all possible means to make such repairs on the vessel as would enable her to be brought to a place of safety. Whether there was a sale or not, all this was done by the company, or by persons acting with the authority of the company, and there was nothing done, so far as they were concerned, which at any time prevented the plaintiffs from taking possession and treating the vessel as if no disaster had ever overtaken her.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is right, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: E. & R.

Heughan, Third Party Added by Order of Court.\n1894: March 28; 1894: May 31.\nPresent: Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nEvidence\u2014Action for personal injuries caused by negligence\u2014Examination of plaintiff de bene esse\u2014Death of plaintiff\u2014Action by widow under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act\u2014Admissibility of evidence taken in first action\u2014 Rights of third party.\nThough the cause of action given by Lord Campbell\u2019s Act for the benefit of the widow and children of a person whose death results from injuries received through negligence is different from that which the deceased had in his lifetime, yet the material issues are substantially the same in both actions, and the widow and children are in effect, claiming through the deceased. Therefore, where an action is commenced by a person so injured in which his evidence is taken de bene esse and the defendant has a right to cross-examine such evidence is admissible in a subsequent action taken after his death under the act. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nThe admissibility of such evidence as against the original defendants, a municipal corporation sued for injuries caused by falling into an excavation in a public street, is not affected by the fact that they have caused a third party to be added as defendant as the person who was really responsible for such excavation and that such third party was not notified of the examination of the plaintiff in the first action, and had no opportunity to cross-examine him. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] by which a new trial was ordered.\nThe action in this case was brought under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act in consequence of the death of John B. Erdman, from injuries received by falling into an excavation in one of the streets of the town. Erdman before his death had instituted an action for damages for such injuries in which by order of the court his evidence was taken de bene esse counsel for the town appearing at such examination and cross-examining. The sole question to be decided on this appeal is whether or not such evidence was admissible on the trial of the present action. The trial judge refused to receive it, and there being no other evidence of the manner in which deceased was injured the plaintiff was non-suited. The non-suit was set aside by the Divisional Court and a new trial ordered which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal from whose decision this appeal was brought.\nThe defendants had caused Heughan to be added as a defendant alleging that he was responsible for the excavation into which the deceased fell. Heughan was not served with notice of the examination of deceased and so had no opportunity to cross-examine him.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellants. Lord Campbell\u2019s Act gives a new cause of action and one entirely different from that which deceased had in his lifetime. Morgan v. Nicholl[3]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[4].\nAs regards this action the plaintiff is in no way in privity with the deceased. Leggott v. The Great Northern Railway Co[5].; Wood v. Gray[6]. The former action might have been revived when the evidence could have been used; Mason, v. Town of Peterborough[7]; but the plaintiff elected to proceed for her own benefit and lost the right to profit by the former proceedings.\nShaw Q.C. for the respondent. The issues in both actions are substantially the same, and the evidence comes within the rules laid down in the books. Greenleaf on Evidence[8]; Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co[9].\nThe plaintiff in this action is bound by any admissions made by deceased, which shows privity. Griffiths v. Earl Dudley[10].\nO\u2019Connor Q.C. for third party.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal. I concur in my brother Gwynne\u2019s opinion.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff as widow and administratrix of the late John Erdman, to recover for her own benefit and the benefit of her children by the said John Erdman, damages sustained by them respectively by the death of the said John Erdman, pursuant to the provisions of the statute in that behalf, the death of the said John Erdman being, in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, alleged to have been caused by falling into a deep hole, ditch or drain which had, by the Corporation of the town of Walkerton, their servants and agents, been negligently permitted to be dug, and was negligently left open, uncovered, unfenced and unprotected. The defendants, the town of Walkerton, under the provisions of sec. 531 of ch. 184 R.S.O. as amended by 54 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 24, caused one R.E. Heughan to be made a party defendant, or third party, as being the person who had dug the ditch or drain, and was responsible for all consequences arising from the matters alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, if proved as alleged, and among other defences they further pleaded as follows:\nThese defendants further say that the hole, or ditch or drain mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim was dug, made and left in the condition in which it was at the time of the said accident, not by these defendants but by the defendant Heughan, who was not a servant or agent of these defendants, and who so dug and made the said excavation without their consent or knowledge, and if any damages and costs are recovered in this action against the defendants they aver that such damages were sustained by reason of the said obstruction, excavation or opening in the said highway, and pursuant to the statute claim to recover over against said Heughan the amount of any such damages and costs together with the costs incurred by the said corporation in their defence of this action.\nThe defendant Heughan denied all the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim made, except those made in the first and second paragraphs thereof, and he further, among other things, pleaded as follows:\n5. The defendant R.E. Heughan further says that the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim does not show any cause of action as against the defendants, the Corporation of the town of Walkerton, and he claims the same benefit from this objection as if he had demurred to said statement of claim.\n6. The said R.E. Heughan further says that he craves the benefit of any defence the said Corporation of the town of Walkerton may have to said action.\n7. The said R.E. Heughan further says that if it be proved that the said John B. Erdman was wounded, damaged or injured in any way by falling into said trench, ditch or drain, that the said wounds, damages or injuries did not cause or occasion the death of the said John B. Erdman.\n8. The said R.E. Heughan further says that the said John B. Erdman might and could, by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, have seen the said hole, ditch or drain and avoided falling into it, or sustaining any injuries by reason thereof; and the said R.E. Heughan says as the fact is that the said alleged accident and the injuries alleged to have been sustained by said John B. Erdman thereby were caused by his own negligence and want of care.\nUpon these pleading issue being joined the case went down for trial.\nThe law in virtue of which Heughan was made a party defendant in the present action, ch. 184, R.S.O., sec. 531, subsec. 4 enacts that:\nIn case an action is brought against a municipal corporation to recover damages sustained by reason of any obstruction, excavation or opening in a public highway, street or bridge placed, made, left or maintained by any other corporation, or by an person other than a servant or agent of the municipal corporation, the last mentioned corporation shall have a remedy over against the other corporation or person for, and any enforce payment accordingly of, the damages and costs, if any, which the plaintiff in the action may recover against the municipal corporation.\nSubsec. 5. The municipal corporation shall be entitled to such remedy over in the same action if the other corporation or person shall be made a party to the action, and if it shall be established in the action as against the other corporation or person, that the damages were sustained by reason of an obstruction, excavation or opening as aforesaid, placed, made, left or maintained by the other corporation or person, and the municipal corporation may in such case have the other corporation or person added as a party defendant or third party for the purposes hereof, if the same is not already a defendant in the action jointly with the municipal corporation, and the other corporation or person may defend such action as well against the plaintiff\u2019s claim as against the claim of the municipal corporation to a remedy over.\nThe effect of this statute, as it appears to me, is to make the third party so made defendant a principal defendant equally with his co-defendant, and where no question arises as to the fact of the obstruction alleged to have caused the injury complained of having been made by him (and in the present case no such question arises) as a principal defendant, and as the person ultimately liable, he has a right to insist that the plaintiff\u2019s case shall be established by such evidence as would be necessary to bind him if he was sole defendant, and to assert such rights even by appeal, whether the appeal be in the name of his co-defendant or in his own name. The judgment to be recovered by the plaintiff in such an action being made by the statute conclusively binding upon him the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action must be proved by evidence which would be binding on him, and no proceeding in the action can be taken behind his back, or without notice to him so as to give him an opportunity of contesting the plaintiff\u2019s claim in every particular necessary to be established by him.\nNow, in the present case the only evidence offered in support of the allegation that the deceased, John B. Erdman, received the injury alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim as the cause of his death, was a deposition made in his lifetime by the said John B. Erdman, which the learned trial judge refused to receive and non-suited the plaintiff. That non-suit having been set aside and a new trial ordered this appeal is taken, and the sole question is whether the evidence was admissible. If it was not the non-suit must be restored, as it is admitted that no other evidence exists upon the point.\nThe deposition so rejected by the learned trial judge was procured and made in the manner following:\nOn the 9th March, 1892, the said John B. Erdman in his lifetime commenced by writ of summons an action against the Corporation of the town of Walkerton; immediately upon the service of that writ the corporation caused a notice of a motion for an order that the above defendant, R.E. Heughan, should be made a party defendant to the said action, to be served upon the said John B. Erdman and the said Heughan. By reason of the county or local judge at Walkerton being absent from home that motion could not be heard until the 25th day of March, 1892, when an order was made, the plaintiff not objecting, though represented (as alleged in the order) whereby it was ordered, among other things, that the said R.E. Heughan be, and he was thereby, made a defendant to the action.\nAnd thereby it was further ordered that in case the said R.E. Heughan should enter an appearance that any of the parties might apply to the court or a judge for a direction as to having any question that might arise determined; and the order reserved to the said Heughan all rights that he might have to object to the examination of the plaintiff taken in the action prior to the date of the order, being read or used in evidence against him on the trial of the action.\nThe defendant, Heughan, appeared to the action in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court at Walkerton, where the action was brought. After the service of notice of motion for the above order, and on the 12th March, 1892, the plaintiff caused an application to be made to the master in chambers at Toronto for, and obtained from him, an ex parte order whereby it was ordered that the plaintiff might be examined viv\u00e2 voce on his own behalf before Samuel Herbert McKay, and that the examination so taken might be given in evidence on the trial of the action, saving all just exceptions. The fact of the issue of this order at Toronto was telegraphed to the plaintiffs attorney at Walkerton on the said 12th March, who upon the same day served upon the Mayor of Walkerton and the solicitor of the corporation the notice following:\nTake notice that the master in chambers has this day made an order for the making of the evidence of the plaintiff de bene esse before Samuel H. McKay of Walkerton, and that such evidence will be taken in the rooms of said John B. Erdman at the county jail at said town of Walkerton, on Monday, the 14th day of March instant, at seven o\u2019clock in the evening, and that if you or your solicitor or agent desire to be present and to cross-examine said John B. Erdman upon the evidence so to be taken as aforesaid, you or he must then and there attend on such examination and cross-examine him.\nFurther take notice that the reason why such examination is required to be taken is that the said plaintiff is sick and seriously ill.\nAnd take notice that if you object to the shortness of this notice, and do not attend to cross-examine said plaintiff at said time and place, the said John B. Erdman will be further examined at said place at the hour of ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon on Wednesday, the 16th day of March inst., if then alive and able to give evidence.\nYours &c.,\nSHAW & SHAW.\nNo notice of such intended examination appears to have been served upon Heughan. No one appeared for the corporation defendant, and the plaintiff was examined ex parte; again, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor attended in the morning of the 16th March, but neither the corporation or their solicitor attended upon that occasion, and nothing further appears to have been then done.\nBut on the 17th March, 1892, the plaintiffs attorney, fearing that there might be some question as to the sufficiency of the notice of the 12th March, served upon the solicitor of the Corporation of Walkerton notice to the effect that on the 21st day of March a motion would be made before the master in chambers at Toronto for an order, that the evidence already taken of the plaintiff, under order dated 12th March, 1892, might be used subject to all just exceptions in the event of the plaintiff\u2019s death, in any action which the wife or children of the said plaintiff might bring against the defendant corporation under the Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 135, or in the alternative, that an order might be made for the examination of the said plaintiff viv\u00e2 voce on oath upon notice, giving six hours notice to the defendants of the time and place where such examination is to be held, and that the evidence when so taken might be filed in the cause with the deputy clerk of the crown at Walkerton, and used in any action which the said relatives of said plaintiff might bring after his death under said ch. 135, on the ground that said plaintiff was dying and that his testimony would be lost with his death.\nThe master in chambers, upon this motion coming before him on the 21st March, 1892, referred the first part of the motion to a judge in chambers and made an order upon the residue to the effect that without prejudice to the motion, the plaintiff should be examined once more upon oath, before Samuel Herbert McKay of the town of Walkerton, on Wednesday, the 23rd day of March, 1892, in the forenoon, in case his state of health permitted, upon notice to the defendants and the said third party, and it was thereby further ordered that notice served upon Tuesday the 22nd instant should be good and sufficient notice of such examination, and the time for giving notice was thereby shortened accordingly. And it was thereby further ordered that the examination when so taken be filed in the office of the deputy clerk of the crown for the County of Bruce, and that an office copy or copies thereof might be read in evidence on the trial of the action, saving all just exceptions, upon giving sufficient proof of the absence of the said plaintiff or of his inability to be present to testify on his own behalf at said trial.\nAnd it was thereby further ordered that the costs of the application be reserved to be disposed of upon the pending motion. (i.e. on the motion reserved before the judge in chambers.)\nNotice of the intended examination on the 23rd instant was, upon the 22nd March, served upon the solicitor of the defendant, the Corporation of Walkerton, but no notice appears to have been served upon Heughan. Upon the 23rd the solicitor of the corporation attended, but abstained from cross-examining the plaintiff, upon the ground, as he alleges, that he was informed by the plaintiffs medical attendant that the plaintiff was sinking fast and could only live for a few days; and therefore, he did not in the plaintiff\u2019s state of health wish to worry him. Upon the 31st day of March Mr . Justice Street disposed, in chambers, of the motion before the master in chambers upon the notice of the 17th March so as aforesaid reserved by the master in chambers, and by an order dated the said 31st day of March, it was ordered that the said application of the plaintiff, made on the 21st day of March pursuant to the said notice of the 17th March, in so far as the same sought for an order in the nature of an order perpetuating testimony, should be and the same was thereby dismissed; and it was further ordered that the costs of the application should be costs to the defendants in any event of the action on the final taxation of costs therein.\nUpon this same 31st day of March the plaintiff filed and served his statement of claim against the defendants the Corporation of Walkerton, and the defendant R.E. Heughan, therein alleged to have been made defendant by an order bearing date the 23rd day of March, 1892, and therein alleged that he had suffered injury from falling into a ditch in a street of the town of Walkerton which the corporation of that town were alleged to have negligently suffered to remain open, uncovered, unprotected, &c. Before any pleas had been filed to this statement of claim, namely, on the following day, the plaintiff died, and that action thereby became abated.\nNow the question is whether the depositions of the said John B. Erdman, so taken, are admissible as evidence for the plaintiff in the present action against the contention of the defendants, the Corporation and Heughan, that they are not; and I am of opinion that the learned trial judge\u2019s decision that they were not was correct and sound, and should be maintained upon the grounds following:\n1. Upon the authority of the recent cases and especially since the judgment of the Privy Council in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11] it cannot be disputed in this court that the present action at the suit of the widow of the deceased, John B. Erdman, is a wholly different action in every particular from that instituted by Erdman in his lifetime. It is between wholly different parties and founded upon wholly different rights. Although the plaintiff is personal representative of the deceased she claims not in right of the deceased or of his estate, but being personal representative she is by statute authorized in that character to assert her own independent rights and those of her children.\n2. The evidence is sought to be used in the present action not only against the Corporation of Walkerton but against the defendant Heughan also, and as no judgment in favour of the plaintiff can be rendered herein which is not conclusively binding upon Heughan as well as upon the corporation, he cannot be affected by depositions taken in an action to which he was not a party; et ergo depositions so taken cannot be used as evidence for the plaintiff in the present action.\n3. The depositions of the 14th March, 1892, having been taken not only upon insufficient notice as affecting the defendants, the corporation, but behind the back of the defendant Heughan at a time when the plaintiff John B. Erdman knew of the pendency of a notice of motion that Heughan should be made a defendant, which motion was granted by the order of the 31st March, 1892, and the depositions of the 21st March, 1892, having been taken while the said plaintiff, John B. Erdman, was aware of the still pending of such notice of motion, and without notice to the defendant Heughan of the intended taking of such depositions, although by the order of the 21st March, 1892, notice to him was made a condition precedent to the taking of such depositions, the depositions could not have been given in evidence in the former action if the statement of claim therein which was subsequently filed on the 31st March, 1892, had been pleaded to by the defendants therein and issues had been joined which had gone down for trial during the lifetime of the said John B. Erdman, if he had lived and from continuing illness had been unable to attend and be examined at the trial, because the effect of the action as stated in the statement of claim against both defendants, being by force of the statute under which Heughan was made defendant to affect him with liability, no evidence could be received to affect him which had been taken behind his back, and without notice to him. So neither could it be received to affect the corporation as, by force of the statute, judgment could not be against them without Heughan being conclusively condemned and affected thereby.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the learned trial judge was correct in his ruling at the trial and that therefore this appeal must be allowed with costs and that judgment of non-suit be ordered to be entered in the court below.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed I think the evidence was properly admitted.\nKING J.\u2014This action was brought to recover damages in respect of the death of one John B. Erdman, occa- sioned, as alleged, by his falling into a ditch in a public street, negligently suffered by the town to remain open and unguarded.\nErdman had in his lifetime begun an action against the town for the recovery of damages, and his evidence was taken in that cause de bene esse upon notice to the town which attended by its solicitor and cross-examined Erdman.\nThe writ in that action was issued on 9th March, 1892. On 17th March Erdman\u2019s solicitors gave to the town notice that they would apply to a master on the 21st March for an order for his examination. Prior to the 21st March the town gave notice to Heughan of a motion to be made to the local High Court Judge that he should be made a co-defendant under the act of Ontario, 55 Vict. c. 42, sec. 531. Such order was duly made on the 25th March, 1892.\nUpon the return of Erdman\u2019s summons on 21st March, 1892, the master ordered that the examination of Erdman de bene esse be made on the 23rd March upon notice to defendants, and to Heughan, who was stated in the order to have been served with a third party notice by defendants.\nThe examination of Erdman took place on 23rd March the solicitor for the town appearing and cross-examining, but, so far as appears, notice of the examination was not served on Heughan, he not having then in fact been made a party to the suit.\nErdman died on 1st April, 1892, and his widow, having proved his will, began this action on 6th June, 1892, for her own benefit as his widow, and for the benefit of four of his children.\nUpon the trial, before Street J. the deposition of Erdman was tendered in evidence and rejected, and there being otherwise no proof of the cause of the injury the plaintiff was non-suited. The non-suit was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Divisional Court, (Armour C.J. and Falconbridge J.) and such judgment has been affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nNotwithstanding the able argument of Mr Aylesworth I think that the judgment of the appeal court should be affirmed.\nThe rule of evidence is thus stated in Taylor on Evidence, sec. 464:\nWhere a witness has given his testimony under oath in a judicial proceeding, in which the adverse litigant had the power to cross-examine, the testimony so given will, if the witness himself cannot be called, be admitted in any subsequent suit between the same parties, or those claiming under them, provided it relate to the same subject or substantially involve the same material questions.\nAnd thus, in another work on evidence (Stephen art. 32.)\nEvidence given by a witness in a previous action is relevant for the purpose of proving the matter stated in a subsequent proceeding\u2026 when the witness is dead, provided[12] the person against whom the evidence is to be given had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant when he was examined as a witness; that the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding; and that the proceeding, if civil, was between the same parties, or their representatives in interest12.\nThe evidence of Erdman was testimony under oath in a judicial proceeding and (as Mr Justice Osler points out) was not the less so because taken de bene esse and never actually used on the trial of the action in which it was taken.\nSubject to the observations to be made respecting the position of the third party it also satisfies the rule that the party against whom it is offered in the present action, viz.: the Corporation of Walkerton, had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant when he was examined as a witness, and in fact exercised the right. Then as to the second requirement of the rule, viz.: that the questions in issue shall be substantially the same, or (as stated in Taylor) that the evidence relate to the same subject, or substantially involve the same material question, this does not require that all the issues in the two actions shall correspond. It is satisfied if the evidence relates to any material issues that are substantially the same in both actions.\nNow the question of fact whether the injury to Erdman (the alleged cause of his death) was occasioned by the negligent act or omission of the town was a material issue in the action brought by him, and it is equally a material issue in the present action, as the plaintiff is bound to show that the death was occasioned by an act or default of the town which gave to Erdman a right of action against the town at the time of his death. And the evidence in question was tendered in support of that issue.\nIf indeed the admissibility of the evidence were to depend upon the causes of action being the same the respondent could not hope to succeed, because it is conclusively established that the cause of action given by the statute is different from that which the deceased had in his lifetime [13].\nIn the last named case Lord Selborne says:\nLord Campbell\u2019s Act gives a new cause of action clearly, and does not merely remove the operation of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2, because the action is given in substance not to the person representing in point of estate the deceased man, who would naturally represent him as to all his own rights of action which could survive, but to his wife and children, no doubt suing in point of form in the name of his executor. And not only so, but the action is not an action which he could have brought if he had survived the accident for that would have been an action for such injury as he had sustained during his lifetime, but death is essentially the cause of the action, an action which he never could have brought under circumstances which, if he had been living would have given him, for any injury short of death which he might have sustained, a right of action which might have been barred either by contributory negligence, or by his own fault, or by his own release, or in various other ways.\nLord Blackburn also says:\nI think that when that act (Lord Campbell\u2019s Act) is looked at, it is plain enough that if a person dies under the circumstances mentioned, when he might have maintained an action if it had been for an injury to himself which he had survived, a totally new action is given against the person who would have been responsible to the deceased if the deceased had lived, an action which, as is pointed out in Pym v. Great Northern Railway Co.[14], is new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principles, in every way new and which can only be brought if there is any person answering to the description of the widow, parent or child who under such circumstances suffers pecuniary loss by the death.\nBut while the present cause of action is new and different from that brought in his lifetime by Erdman it is nowhere stated that the causes of action are to be identical in order to render admissible in a later action evidence given in an earlier one.\nIt is sufficient that material issues to which the evidence is relevant, and for the proof of which it is in each case adduced, are substantially the same in both proceedings. Here the second cause of action embraces what goes to constitute the first together with other things. I conclude therefore that the second requirement of the rule is met.\nThen as to the third requirement, viz.: that the proceedings in the two actions shall be between the same parties, or those claiming under them. The plaintiff in this action, although suing as executrix, fills a mere nominal or formal position in the action. As expressed in more than one case the plaintiff so suing is a mere instrument acting on behalf of the person whether widow, child or parent claiming to have sustained pecuniary loss through the death of the deceased[15]. What has to be regarded, therefore, is the relation which the beneficial parties to the action bear in point of interest to the deceased. Can they be said to claim under him? The statutory right of action requires the concurrence of several things, viz: a wrongful act of defendant which would in the lifetime of the deceased have entitled him to maintain an action for the injury; the death occasioned by such wrongful act; the existence of a personal relation of wife, parent or child in the person beneficially claiming; and a damage to such person through the death by the loss of some pecuniary benefit reasonably to have been anticipated from the continuance of the life.\nIn the interpretation of the provision of the statute that the wrongful act causing the death shall be such as would, but for the death, have entitled the person injured to maintain an action, it has been held that this means a right of action subsisting in him down to the time of his death; and that, if previously having a right of action, he released it, or discharged it by accord and satisfaction, the statutory cause of action could not arise upon the death. This is the result of decisions such as Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co[16]., and is supported by the before quoted observations of Lord Selborne in Seward v. Vera Cruz[17].\nI think it follows upon this that the persons seeking the benefit of this action, the widow and children of Erdman, are in effect claiming through him. They are claiming the benefit of a breach of duty which the defendants owed to Erdman, and so in a substantial sense they ground their action, in an essential condition of it, upon rights which in his lifetime he possessed, viz: the right to the exercise towards him of due care, and upon his right of action in his lifetime for breach thereof. Erdman\u2019s executor could make no admission against the right of the persons beneficially entitled but Erdman\u2019s own acts and admissions in his lifetime would be relevant evidence against the present plaintiff\u2019s right of action. One cannot expect to find the analogies complete, and the case before us is new in instance, but in my opinion the effect of the cases as to the injured person\u2019s competency in his lifetime to extinguish the present action by release of his own right of action, as well as the consideration that the statute grounds the present right of action in part upon the breach of a duty owed to the deceased, point to the conclusion that the rule of evidence is reasonably and fairly to be extended by analogy to the new relation created by the statute.\nI therefore think that the judgment below is correct.\nI also agree that the case is not affected by the circumstance of the third party proceedings. The plaintiff may succeed against the town and fail as to Heughan. The town might have made an admission of liability, and this would be admissible evidence against the town but could not bind Heughan. In order to make the third party liable it must be established on the trial, as against him, that the damages were sustained by reason of an obstruction, excavation or opening placed, made, left or maintained by him.\nThis is not made out as against him by evidence admissible against the town but not against him, although such evidence may establish a case as against the original defendant.\nAs to the point that notice of the examination of Erdman was by the order of the master required to be served on Heughan as well as on the town, the latter was not at the time made a third party. Besides, this point, (as I understand it) is not made by the town. On the contrary, they contend that Heughan, not having been made a party, could not have had the right to cross-examine. Hence the point did not engage the attention of the appeal court, and is not to be given weight to here. But in any view I think it not maintainable.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for appellant: William A.

H. H., in capacity of curator to Mrs. B., an , against A., in order to have a certain deed of transfer made to him by Mrs. B., his mother, set aside and cancelled. Mrs. B. having died before the case was brought on to trial the respondent M. B. presented a petition for continuance of the suit on her behalf as one of the legatees of her mother under a will dated the 17th November, 1869. This petition was contested by A.B., who based his contestation on a will dated the 17th January, 1885, the same date as that of the transfer attacked by the original action), whereby the late Mr. B. bequeathed the residue of all of her property, &c, to her two sons. Upon the merits of the contestation as to the validity of the will of the 17th January, 1885.\nHeld affirming the judgment of the court below, that art. 831, C. C. which enacts that the testator must be of sound mind, does not declare null only the will of an insane person, but also the will of all those whose weakness of mind does not allow them to comprehend the effect and consequences of the act which they perform.\nHeld further that upon the facts and evidence in the case, the will of the 17th January, 1885, was obtained by A. as a time when Mrs. B. was suffering from senile dementia and weakness of mind, and was under the undue influence of A. B. and should be set aside.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) rendered on the 5th day of May 1892, reversing a Judgment rendered by the Superior Court in the District of Three Rivers, (Bourgeois J.), on the 16th January, 1891.\nThe proceedings in this case arose as follows; \u2014\nThe original action was taken by G. B. Houliston, in his quality of curator, to Dame Isabella Cockburn an interdict, widow of the late George Baptist, against Alexander Baptist John Baptist and various banks and corporations, to set aside a deed of transfer executed by Mrs. Baptist on the 17th January, 1885, of all her property to her son Alexander Baptist, in consideration of a life rent of $3000 and on the further condition that, on the death of Mrs. Baptist Alexander Baptist should be bound to pay her brother John an annual rent of two thousand dollars, alleging that Mrs. Baptist was then in a state of senile dementia and under the undue influence of Alexander Baptist\nThis action was only contested by the defendant Alexander Baptist. The pleas, inter alia, denied the existence of the family arrangement alleged by the plaintiff and asserted that ! Mrs. Baptist was in the full enjoyment of her mental powers until the end of the year 1887, and also denied the use of any undue influence, constraint, pressure or corrupt practices on the part of the defendant to induce his mother to sign the transfer in question.\nThe answer and replication were general.\nOn the 28th of September, 1889, before the case was brought on to trial, Mrs. Baptist died and thereupon the respondent, Dame Margaret Baptist, widow of the late William C. Pentland, presented a petition for continuance of the suit on her behalf, as one of the legatees of her mother under the will of 1869.\nThis petition was contested by the present appellant, Alexander Baptist who based his contestation on a will dated the 17th of January 1885, (the same date as that of the transfer attacked by the original action), whereby the late Mrs. Baptist bequeathed the residue of all property movable and immovable to her two sons John and Alexander Baptist.\nThe petitioner for continuance of suit (now respondent) answered this contestation by alleging that the will invoked by the contestant (now appellant) was-invalid and should be set aside for the same reasons as those urged in support of the principal action, viz., that: Mrs. Baptist was, at the time of the making of this will,-incapable of executing such a document by reason of the decline of her mental powers,; and that this will like the transfer had been obtained from her by her son Alexander Baptist by suggestion, capitation and corrupt practices.\nThe reply to this answer was general, and thereupon the parties went to enqu\u00eate, and examined witnesses in support of their respective pretensions.\nWhen the enqu\u00eate was closed the case was argued before his Honour Mr. Justice Bourgeois, who, on the: 16th of January, 1891, rendered judgment dismissing the petition for continuance of suit with costs, holding that the will of the 17th January 1885, in favour of John and Alexander Baptist should be maintained.\nThe petitioner for continuance of suit then appealed. to the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, in Quebec,. and on the 5th day of May, 1892, that court reversed the judgment of the court below, set aside the will of Mrs. Baptist, executed on the 17th day of January,... 1885, and allowed the present respondent to continue the suit from the last proceedings taken before the death of the original plaintiff ([2]).\nThe question which arose on this appeal turns solely-upon the validity of the will of the 17th January, 1885.\nStuart Q C. and Oliver Q.G., for appellant.\nThe onus probandi that the testator was at the time of the execution of the will in a state of imbecility or dementia, was upon the party contesting the will. Art. 831, C. C, Demolombe ([3]); Dalloz: Supplement au Repertoire ([4]) and. the evidence clearly establishes-that she had her full intelligence wh\u00e9n she made her will.\nAs to whether the will of the 17th January 1885 was the result of undue influence on the part of Alexander Baptist there is no \"evidence to support such a contention on the part of the respondent. As to. what amounts to suggestion and capitation I refer to Marcad\u00e9 ([5]) Demolombe ([6]) Merlin Repert ([7]); Grenier, Donat. and Test. ([8]); Coin-Delisle, Donat. and Test. ([9]); Troplong, Don. and Test. ([10]) Wingrove v. Wingrove ([11]); Dalloz ([12]).\nLaflamme Q. C, and Lafleur, for respondent.\nThe privy Council laid down the rule in the case of Harwood v. Baker ([13]) that \"a testator must not only be able to understand that he is by his will giving the whole of his property to one object of his regard, but that he must also have capacity to comprehend the extent of his property and the nature of the claims of others whom by his will he is excluding from all participation in that property.\" Now in the case under consideration the evidence establishes that Mrs. Baptist was in utter ignorance as to the real amount of her fortune, being under the delusion (encouraged or at least uncontradicted by her sons) that the boys had been ill-used and that the daughters had divided the whole of the estate upon the death of their father We find the old lady making these declarations a very short time after the passing of the deeds and Alexander Baptist admits his mother's delusion about the supposed unfairness in the previous division of the property as having existed anterior to the making of the last will. Then we find the old lady making a declaration on the very day on which the deeds were passed to the effect that she did not know what she had beendoinog, and similar declarations were made a few weeks after to various witnesses. At another time shortly after the passing of the deeds she declared that she understood indeed that she had transferred everything to .Alexander, but she thought it was merely some notes in circulation. At other times again she would declare that she had done it all to protect John, and we have evidence both from Alexander himself and from the notary that this was the purpose of the transfer as explained to her. It is needless to insist upon the fact that John's interests could have been secured without such a transfer and that the transfer has not helped his insolvent estate one whit. Under these circumstances can it be pretended that Mrs. Baptist was capable of understanding the respective claims of her relatives upon her regard and bounty, and of deliberately forming an intelligent purpose of excluding them from any share in her property y\nThe burden of proof in a case of this kind may be shifted from one party to the other according to the presumptions created by circumstances. The leading case of Waring v. Waring, ([14]) decided by the Privy Council, is closely analogous to the case now under consideration. In that case, as in this, the testatrix had undoubtedly died insane, her mental incapacity having been established by an inquisition held shortly before her death. Delusions had also been proved to have existed at an early date and to have gone on increasing after the will was made. Under these circumstances the Privy Council held that the burden of proof was wholly on the party defending the will to prove very satisfactorily the sanity of the testatrix at the time of the factum. Has the appellant in this case satisfactorily proved the existence of a lucid interval between the aberrations proved by Mrs. Bucknell, by Kate Gahan and by Sarah Armstrong in 1882, and by Miss Kiddy and Mary Ann Simmons in 1883 and 1884? We have ([15]) also seen that this return to reason, in the words of Chardon, is not sufficiently established by proving that at the time of the factum the testatrix was in a calmer and more satisfactory condition than before, but there must be clear \"proof of absolute lucidity of mind at the time of the factum when the burden of proof is thus shifted from the impugner of the will to the person propounding it. Now, so far from having been able to establish such a lucid interval the defendant has been unable to rebut the very positive and uncontradicted testimony of the witnesses who established that on the very day on which the deeds were passed, and on various occasions shortly thereafter, the testatrix was in a condition of mind clearly showing that she did not comprehend the meaning and purport of the deeds in question, and the testimony of a medical man further establishes that in June 1885 a very short time after the factum, she was in a state of second childhood.\nIt seems also superfluous to discuss the vexed question of the effects of partial insanity upon the mind of a testator when, as in the present case, most of the delusions referred precisely to the extent of the means and \"property of the testatrix and the claims of those entitled to her bounty Whatever may have been the effect of such delusions as have been noticed above, when the old lady imagined herself to be away from home or to be sailing in about, there can be no possible doubt as to the effect of her persistent delusion that she had no property, that the girls had divided everything at the time of their father's death and that the boys had been ill-used. No delusions could go more clearly to the very root of the subject and exercise a more disturbing influence upon the old lady's mind, so as to prevent her from forming an intelligent or deliberate purpose with regard to the disposition of her property. The learned counsel also cited and relied on as being applicable to the evidence the following authorities inter alia. Marcad\u00e8 and Pont sur. art 901 section 485; Laurent ([16]); Russell v. Lefrancois ([17]) Demolombe ([18]) Banks v. Goodfellow ([19]) Smee v. Smee ([20]) Chardon Dol et Fraude ([21]); Rousseau de Lacombe ([22]); Avotte v. Boucher ([23]).\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE\u2011I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. L'action en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e le 28 mai 1889, par G. B.

L'appelant dit dans son t\u00e9moignage: \"the will was made to cover everything she owned \" et qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transporte.\nLes m\u00eames moyens \u00e9tant invoqu\u00e9s contre ces deux actes, ii n'est gu\u00e8re possible de les s\u00e9parer l'un de l'autre dans l'examen de cette cause Ces deux actes faits dans le m\u00eame moment dans les m\u00eames circonstances ne forment qu'un seul et m\u00eame r\u00e8glement concernant la fortune de Mde Baptist, le testament n'est que le compl\u00e9ment du transport.\nSi Mde Baptist n'\u00e9tait pas dans un \u00e9tat mental lui permettant de faire le transport elle n'\u00e9tait pas non plus daus un \u00e8tat \u00e0 pouvoir faire le testament et si le .testament est le r\u00e9sultat d\u00ba la suggestion et de la captation on ne peut en conclure qu'il soit la libre expression de la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice. Dans sa contestation de testament de 1885 l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue en substance que par un arrangement de famille fait en 1869, Mr et Mme Baptist ont r\u00e8gle la part de chacun de leurs enfants dans leur fortune que M. Baptist a pris ses fils en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun d'eux un quart de son entreprise qui comprenait pour ainsi dire tous ses biens et qui \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 $400,000, ce qui faisait pour chacun d'eux $100000; que le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re, qui \u00e9taient en communaut\u00e9, ont fait en m\u00eame temps leur testament en faveur de leurs filles donnant \u00e0 chacune d'elles environ une somme de $40,000. L'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue encoee que George Baptist est mort en 1875, que l'intelligence de Mme Baptist est all\u00e9e en d\u00e9clinant depuss le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari et surtout depuis 1883; qu'en 1884 son \u00e9tat mental s'est aggrav\u00e9 par la faiblesse physique et la c\u00e9cit\u00e9, et qu'elle devint compl\u00e8tement incapable d'administrer ses affaires, que depuis le d\u00e9c\u00e8s do son pr\u00e9, l'appelant avait acquis une grande influence sun sa m\u00e8re surtout \u00e0 raison de sa c\u00e9cit\u00e9 et de sa faiblesse d'esprit qu\u2019il avait contr\u00f4l\u00e9 les affaires, collect\u00e9 ses revenus, et que profitant de son ascendant il lui avait fait consentir le transport et le testament du 17 janvier 1885; que Ia testatrice ne pouvait pas alors comprendre la port\u00e9e de ses actes et qu'elle ne connaissait pas l'\u00e9tat et l'\u00e9tendue do sa fortune; quo l'appelant a cach\u00e9 \u00e0 la famille l'existence de ces actes que l'intim\u00e9e et ses s\u0153urs ayant appris l'existence du transport ne purent obtenir de leur m\u00e8re des renseignements satisfaisants, qu'alors elles s'adress\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'appelant qui refusa do parier, qu'ensuite elles demand\u00e8rent au notaire une copie de l'acte de transport que ce dernier refusa d'apr\u00e8s les instructions de de lappelant, quelles requirent un compulsoire, que l'appelant est intervenu, a contest\u00e9 leur demande, et quo m\u00eame il r\u00e9ussit en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais perdit en la Cour de R\u00e9vision, que le testament n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 connu que par sa production en cour. L'appelant a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 gen\u00e8ralement.\nIl est clairement prouv\u00e9 que l'appelant avait fait tous ses efforts pour cacher l'existence du transport \u00e0 ses s\u0153urs. il savait que Mde McDougall, qui lui de-' mandait des renseignements, avait une r\u00e9clamation personnelle contre la faillite de John et qu'elle \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la position de ses affaires. Le transport n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 que par extrait, ii n'\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re possible d'en conna\u00eetre la nature. Toutes les pr\u00e9cautions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour tenir ces actes secrets,\nIl donne des raisons futiles pour expliquer son refus de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une lettre de Mde Macdougall. Ii dit d'abord qu'il \u00e9tait malade, et dans un autre endroit, il attribue \u00e0 son ent\u00eatement le refus de donner des renseignements, et aussi parce qu'on lui avait envoy\u00e9 un avocat an lieu de s'adresser \u00e0 lui comme \u00e0 un parent. il pr\u00e9tend que sa m\u00e8re lui avait demand\u00e9 le secret, et pour derni\u00e8re excuse il pr\u00e9tend que la connaissance du transport aurait nui au r\u00e8glement de la faillite de John.\nL'excuse de sa maladie ne pouvait durer toujours, et il devait avoir quelqu'un pendant ce temps charg\u00e9 du soin de ses affaires\nPuis comment concilier la demande de secret faite par la testatrice, quand elle-m\u00eame, aussit\u00f4t que les actes ont faits, en a parle \u00e0 sa dame de compagnie, Mlle Kiddy, et plus tard \u00e0 sa fille Mde McDougall? Cachait-il l'existence du transport pour obtenir de ses s\u0153urs, une meilleure composition, surtout de Mde McDougall en laissant croire que leur m\u00e8re \u00e9tait encore int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans la faillite. Ce motif, peu honorable fait voir le manque de sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de toutes ses excuses et d\u00e9montre qu'il n'agissait ainsi que par la crainte d'une contestation du transport et dans le but de retarder autant que possible les procedures que ses soeurs entendaient prendre. C'est ce qui explique sa contestation vexatoire faite \u00e0 la demande d'un compulsoire. Ces incidents sont de nature \u00e0 prouver les intentions de fraude qu'animaient l'appelant dans ses d\u00e9marches pour obtenir l'acte de transport et le testament.\nLes moyens de contestation sont l'insanit\u00e9 d'esprit chez Ia testatrice, suggestion et captation de la part de l'appelant.\nLa d\u00e9mence senile a certainement exist\u00e9 chez la testatrice, puisqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interdite pour cette cause en 1889; mais le point important qu'il faut constater, c'est de savoir si la faiblesse d'\u00e9prit de la testatrice \u00e9tait de nature au 17 janvier 1885, \u00e0 rendre la testatrice incapable de faire valablement son testament \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\nComme l'observe avec taut de raison, Sir Alexandre Lacoste:\n\u201cCette maladie ne vient pas subitement, son progr\u00e8s est parfois rapide; mais elle prend souvent des ann\u00e9es \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les forces physiques sen vont la m\u00e9moire s'affaiblit et la volont\u00e9 s'\u00e9mousse Les efforts intellectuels deviennent p\u00e9nibles puis impossibles. Pendant longtemps l'\u00e2me contr\u00f4le les actes ordinaires et simples de Ia vie sans qu'elle puisse cependant saisir et comprendre les actes complexes qui exigent de la m\u00e9moire et du raisonnement. Le caract\u00e8re de cette maladie c'est d'\u00eatre sans merci elle peut s'arr\u00eater dans sa marche, mais la gu\u00e9rison n'est pas possible. Ii est toujours difficile de d\u00e9terminer le commencement de la folie proprement dite Heureusement nous ne sommes pas appel\u00e9s a d\u00e9terminer ce point.\"\nL'art 831 du code civil exige que le testateur soit sain d'esprit. Cette disposition ne s'applique pas seulement \u00e0 celui qui est frapp\u00e9 de folie mais aussi \u00e0 tous ceux dont la faiblesse d'esprit les rend incapables d'appr\u00e9cier la port\u00e9e et les cons\u00e9quences de leurs actes.\nLes circonstances dans lesquelles se trouvait Mde Baptist sont correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par l'honorable juge en chef. Mde Baptist dit-il \" a subi dans sa vieillesse des \u00e9preuves dures et cruelles.\" En 1875, elle a perdu son mari. En 1882, elle a eu l'op\u00e9ration de la cataracte, puis elle a souffert du glaucome et enfin, eu 1884, elle est devenue compl\u00e8tement aveugle, en 1885, lors de i\u2019 ex\u00e9cution des actes de transport et du testament, elle \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de 78 ans. ii est incontestable que durant ' cette p\u00e9riode de temps de 1875 \u00e0 1885, l'\u00e2ge, l'affliction la douleur et la c\u00e9cit\u00e9 ont consid\u00e9rablement diminu\u00e9 ses forces physiques et intellectuelles, mais ii est toujours difficile de constater l'\u00e9tat mental d'une personne par des t\u00e9moignages cinq ans apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e8nements alors que les faits ne sont plus frais dans la m\u00e9moire.\nEn lisant la preuve apparemment contradictoire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e dans la cause par des t\u00e9moins parents, alli\u00e9s et amis on serait tent\u00e9 de croire \u00e0 un grand nombre de parjures. D'aucuns font remonter la perte de la m\u00e9moire et les sympt\u00f4mes pr\u00e9curseurs de la d\u00e9mence \u00e0 1882 les autres ne constatent les premiers signes de l'affaiblissement mental qu'\u00e0 la fin de 1886 ou m\u00eame en 1887. Est-ce \u00e0 dire qu\u2019aucun de ces t\u00e9moins n\u2019ait voulu tromper? Je ne le crois pas chacun a dit ce qu'il a constat\u00e9. Sa m\u00e9moire a pu lui faire d\u00e9faut dans les d\u00e9tails mais l'ensemble de son t\u00e9moignage doit \u00eatre conforme aux faits, j'en suis convaincu. Dans cette appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages, je laisse \u00e9videmment de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de l'appelant et celui de son fr\u00e8re tous deux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et d\u00e9fendeurs dans la cause. La loi m'avertit de n'accepter qu'avec r\u00e9serves les dires des parties.\nLes t\u00e9moins de l'appelant ses trois filles Houliston et son \u00e9pouse, le Dr Blair, son beau-fr\u00e8re et son \u00e9pouse qui ne voyait la testatrice que de temps \u00e0 autre, Joseph Reynar, qui la voyait une fois 'par semaine, Denis Aubuchon homme de cour chez la testatrice qui n'a jamais en de conversation avec elle, Alex. MeKelvie. qui la voyait tous les dimanches et qui causait avec elle du bon vieux temps, semblent n'avoir constat\u00e9 chez elle que la faiblesse due an vieil \u00e2ge avant 1886-7. Mais aucun d'eux n'a v\u00e9cu dans son intimit\u00e9.\nLe rev. Ameron, qui a demeur\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es, de 1879 \u00e0 1884, \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, comme ministre de l'Eglise de la testatrice, et qui l'a revu en 1885-6-7, dit qu'elle a eu sa raison jusqu'en 1887, cependant, il dit qu'il a trouv\u00e9 sa raison affaiblie; son opinion est r\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question suivante:\u2014\n\" Q. From your knowledge, do you believe that she could at any time that you were acquainted with her comprehend the effect or bearing of a transaction transferring the largest portion of her estate and fixing the condition thereof?\n\u201cR. If I had been interested in the matter I should not have wished to have entrusted anything of the kind to her.\"\nLe rev. Curie successeur du rev. Ameron dit qu'il la croyait saine d'esprit en 1887. Mr. McDougall son gendre, qui la voyait une fois on deux par ann\u00e9e, ne peut dire qu'elle \u00e9tait insane avant 1886; mais il ajoute qu'elle \u00e9tait trop faible d'esprit pour pouvoir accomplir aucun acte s\u00e9reux d'affaire qu'elle ne connaissait ni la nature ni la valeur de ses biens.\nLorsquil est all\u00e9 la voir en 1886 elle avait oubli\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait mari\u00e9 \u00e0 sa fille.\nL'opinion de ces personnes qui ne vivaient pas avec elle s'explique assez facilement. Avant qu'elle f\u00fbt compl\u00e8tement en d\u00e9mence, elle pouvait faire les actes ordinaires de la vie. La visite de ces personnes produisait, momentan\u00e9ment sur la testatrice un effet qui r\u00e9veillait son intelligence assoupie, et elle pouvait alors tenir une conversation banale sun les choses ordinaires de la vie. Les sympt\u00f4mes graves n'apparaissaient qu'\u00e0 certains moments et devant les intimes de sorte que plusieurs ont pu de bonne foi la croire dans son bon sens. C'est ainsi que le Dr Gervais qui l'a visit\u00e9 deux fois en 1882 dit l'avoir trouv\u00e9 avec sa pleine intelligence, cepeudant, les trois servantes qu\u00eataient l\u00e0 dans ce temps, ou vers ce temps, Emma Collins, Mary Ann Simmons, Kate Gahan, ont remarqu\u00e9 chez elle une conduite \u00e9trange une humeur maussade, et beaucoup d'irritabilit\u00e9. Elle donnait des' ordres contradictoires, sa conduite leur faisait croire que son esprit d\u00e9clinait et elles se disaient entre elles que la testatrice n'\u00e9tait pas all there.\"\nUne amie intime, Mde Bucknall, qui la connaissait depuis longtemps, est all\u00e9e la voir pour la derni\u00e8re fois en 1882. Parfois la testatrice ne la reconnaissait pas et m\u00eame ne reconnaissait pas toujours sa fille Mde McDougall, qui \u00e9tait alors chez elle.\nPlusieurs t\u00e9moins disent qu'Ils n'ont trouv\u00e9 rien d'\u00e9trange chez la testatrice, avant 1887. Cependant son fils John Baptist, dont le t\u00e9moignage ne saurait \u00eatre suspect\u00e9 rapporte un \u00e9cart de raison bien caract\u00e9ris\u00e9, arriv\u00e9 au printemps de 1886. La testatrice s'imaginait alors qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas chez elle, et qu'elle semait des patates. Son fils lui fit. remarquer qu'elle aurait beaucoup de peine \u00e0 les semer dans la neige, et il ajoute: \" On some subjects she conversed as rationally as possible.\"\nCes faits expliquent pourquoi un si grand nombre de t\u00e9moins ont pu jurer qu'elle \u00e9tait saine d'esprit \u00e0 une \u00e9poque tandis que d'autres, qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents lors de ses excentricit\u00e9s, ont pu coustaer sa faiblesse d'esprit \u00e0 une \u00e9poque m\u00eame ant\u00e9rieure.\nComme le dit l'honorable juge en chef la personne la plus en \u00e9tat de nous renseigner sur l'\u00e9tat mental de Ia testatrice \" est Mile Kiddy, sa dame de compagnie, qui a v\u00e9cu chez la testatrice de 181 jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, qui en a eu continuellement soin, particuli\u00e8rement Ia nuit. Cette Mlle Kiddy, est parfaitement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9 une rente viag\u00e8re de $200 par le testament attaqu\u00e9 et l'annulation de ce testament la priverait de sa rente elle a vu Ia m\u00e9moire de la testatrice s'affaiblir de 1882 \u00e0 1884. Durant l'\u00e9t\u00e8 d\u00e9cente derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, la testatrice fit une chute grave dans laquelle elle se blessa \u00e0 la t\u00e8te. Cette chute aurait aggrav\u00e9 son \u00e9tat mental et des lors les hallucinations seraient devenues plus marqu\u00e9es. La testatrice se figurait, parfois, qu'on avait change son lit de place, elle se disait pauvre. voulait entreprendre de la couture, garder des pensionnaires s'imaginait \u00eatre ailleurs que chez elle et allait jusqu'\u00e0 croire son mari vivant. Toutes ces hallucinations ne sont pas venues \u00e0 Ia fois elles out \u00e9t\u00e9 remarqu\u00e9es, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moin, de 1884 \u00e0 1887. L'opinion de Mlle Kiddy est, qu'en 1885, la testatrice n'\u00e9tait pas dans un \u00e9tat d'esprit qui lui permettait de consentir un transport on de faire un testament.\"\nCe t\u00e9moignage est corrobor\u00e9 par celui des deux ser-, vantes, Bridget Purtell et Blien O'Shaughnessy, qui se trouvaient au service de Ia testatrice dans cc temps-l\u00e0. Ces trois t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient parfaitement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s leur caract\u00e8re n'est nullement attaqu\u00e9 et aucune circonstance ne fait voir qu'elles se sont concert\u00e9es pour ne pas dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9\nJohn reconna\u00eet qu'il a essay\u00e9 d\u2019influencer sa m\u00e8re pour lui faire faire un testament en sa faveur Dans une circonstance dit-il sa m\u00e8re lui aurait offert tout cc qu'elle avait dans une autre elle aurait r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande en lui disant que ses deux fils John et .Alex \u00e9taient \"both alike to herr.\" Elle lui avait dit que ses filles h had got plenty.\"\nIl est certain qu'en 1884-86 la testatrice \u00e9tait sous l'impression que ses filles avaient en plus que leur part, et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 favoris\u00e9es an d\u00e9triment des garcons; mais cette id\u00e9e \u00e9tait fausse et injuste il est vrai qu'elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es ses l\u00e9gataires universelles \u00e0 i\u2019 exclusion de ses fils mais ce testament avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en 1869 apr\u00e8s qu'il eut associ\u00e9 ses fils dans son commerce qui comprenait toute Sa fortune \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 $400000 et ii donnait un quart \u00e0 chacun de ses fils soit $100,000. L'appelant a vendu sa part \u00e0 John, $150,000. il n'\u00e9tait que juste que la balance, $200,000, fut distribu\u00e9e entre ses filles au nombre de cinq. C'est sans doute la raison pour laquelle le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re ont fait leur testament en faveur dd leurs filles. Les gar\u00e7ons ont donc re\u00e7u chacun une somme de $100,000, et les filles n'auraient re\u00e7u si elles eussent h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de leur m\u00e8re comme de leur pr\u00e9, chacune, une somme d\u2019environ $40.000 Mais elles n'ont r\u00e9ellement h\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort de leur p\u00e8re que d'une somme de $20,000. A. l'\u00e9poque de ce testament ils \u00e9taient tous deux en bonne saut\u00e9, jouissant de toutes leurs facult\u00e9s, et sans doute qu'ils avaient fait une distribution juste et \u00e9quitable de leur fortune entre leurs enfants. Dans leur intention ce partage devait \u00eatre final et n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 change qu'en cons\u00e9quence de la faiblesse mentale de la testatrice, survenue plus de seize ans apr\u00e8s.\nLa raison donneur les gar\u00e7ons est que cette somme de $1000000 n'\u00e9tait pas un don, mais la reconnaissance des services rendus \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re en travaillant avec lui. il n'y a aucune preuve constatant la longueur et Ia valeur des services rendus, et de plus pendant, tout cc temps, leur p\u00e8re a toujours pourvu \u00e0 leurs besoins et \u00e0 ceux de leur famille. Ils se seraient montr\u00e9s plus justes et plus reconnaissants, en disant ce qui, d'ailleurs, est la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que dans la distribution des biens de leur pr\u00e9, ils ont re\u00e7u leur juste part, sinon plus.\nDans un autre testament fait en 1879 la testatrice n'a pas en l'id\u00e9e d'exclure ses files de sa succession. Sa m\u00e9moire \u00e9tait cependant \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque plus fraiche qu'en 1884 et elle devait mieux se rappeler les circonstances du testament de 1869, n'ayant pas encore ressenti les atteintes de la faiblesse mentale dont elle a souffert plus tard.\nSans doute l'interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e qu'elle donnait an testament de son maril en cc qui concernait les filles, venait de ce qu'elle avait oubli\u00e9 et de cc qu'elle ignorait l'\u00e9tat de ses affaires actuelles. Mlle Kiddy dit qu'elle ne connaissait pas ce qu'elle avait et lors qu\u2019elle lui mentionnait le stock de La Banque do Montr\u00e9al, elle niait qu'elle en out et disait: \"No, the girls got it all when their father died.\" Dans le m\u00eame temps elle disait par une contradiction, quo la porte de la m\u00e9moire pout seule expliquer, quo son mani avait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 chacune de ses filles $1000000 et toutes los propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 son fils, John.\nS'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 quo les fils aient donn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re l'id\u00e9e quo leurs s\u0153urs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es, ii est bien clair que l'opinion de la m\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait que 10 reflet de celle de John, telle qu'il l'a opprim\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage. John a avou\u00e9 avoir sollicit\u00e9 un testament do sa m\u00e8re, et l'appelant a laiss\u00e9 sa m\u00e8re sous l'impression de cette pr\u00e9tendue injustice, et en a profit\u00e9 pour obtenir un testament.\nIls sont tous deux d'accord que leurs s\u0153urs ne devaient pas h\u00e9riter, mais entre eux ils ne s'entendaient pas. John pr\u00e9tend tout avoir, et l'appelant veut aussi avoir sa part. La testatrice qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par la faillite do John, d\u00e9sir\u00e2t 10 prot\u00e9ger, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 elle so croyait pauvre. L'appelant profite do ces deux circonstances pour se faire consentir un transport au d\u00e9triment do John, dans lequel ses s\u0153urs no sont pas comprises. L'appelant admet avoir sugg\u00e8re le transport \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re et ii en donne les motifs suivants;\nThe transfer was made with the intention to settle up the old estate that was in bankruptcy I wanted these means to be able to put value in the estate It put me in a position of being able to make a better offer to the creditors outside than I could have done otherwise. Ces motifs pouvaient \u00eatre une des raisons de demander un transport \u00e0 titre de garantie collat\u00e9rale pour faciliter le r\u00e8glement de la faillite de John, mais ils ne sont donn\u00e9s que comme des faux pr\u00e9textes pour se faire un transport \u00e0 lui personnellement en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qu'il a le soin de faire accompagner d'un testament. . Ce sont ces motifs frauduleux et mensongers oui ont amen\u00e9 la testatrice \u00e0 faire ces deux actes.\nL'appelant qui g\u00e9rait les affaires de la testatrice, admet lui avoir dit que ses revenus qui ne rapportaient que $1,800 \u00e8taient insuffisants, et lui avoir offert en retour une rente viag\u00e8re de $3,000. Cette offre a sans doute d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 accepter. Ii dit dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il ne croyait pas que sa m\u00e8re put d\u00e9penser cette rente:\nC\u2019\u00e9tait apparemment pour prot\u00e9ger John et sa m\u00e8re que l'appelant semblait agir, mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 son seul profit. Sa m\u00e8re est rest\u00e9e tellement impressionn\u00e9e des motifs d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s de i\u2019 appelant qu'elle dit \u00e0 sa fille Mde McDougall qu'elle a tout donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, pensant lui avoir tr\u00e8s peu donn\u00e9, pour qu'il la fit vivre toute sa vie; \u00e0 Mile Kiddy et \u00e0 d'autres, elle d\u00e9clare qu'elle avait tout fait \" For Jack's sake.\" Evidemment, elle n'avait pas compris ce qu'elle avait fait. C'est ce qui ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage du notaire Hubert, qui a pass\u00e9 le transport et fait le testament. Voici, ce qu'il en dit\nR. Monsieur Baptist lorsqu'il m'a fait demander, sept (7) on huit (8) jours avant, m'a dit que Madame Baptist voulait faire quelques changements a son testament et qu'elle d\u00e9sir\u00e2t faire le transport de certains droits, que \u00e7a faisait plusieurs fois quelle lui en parlait, qu'il avait toujours diff\u00e9r\u00e9, mais qu'elle insistait. De sorte qu'il m'a donn\u00e9 les notes, de faire le transport de telles et telles parts de banque donn\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans l'acte. Ensuite, son testament, si je me rappelle bien, il avait une copie du testament il ma dit qu'elle d\u00e9sirait faire tels et tels changements que jai fait, et apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 mes actes... Lors de la passation des actes, c'est l'appelant, d'apres le notaire Hubert qui a fait toute la conversation avec sa m\u00e8re bien qu'il ait dit le contraire et pr\u00e9tendu an contraire que c'\u00e9tait le notaire. C'est pour cacher l'exercice de son influence jusqu'au dernier moment qu'il parle ainsi contre la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Je crois devoir citer \u00e0 ce propos les observations suivantes de l'honorable juge en chef:\u2014\nAjoutons \u00e0 cela que c'est l'intime qui a donn\u00e9 les instructions et a tout fait pr\u00e9parer, qui a re\u00e7u les actes des mains da notaire plusieurs jours avant qu'ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 signes, qui a accompagn\u00e9 le notaire chez la testatrice qui a discut\u00e9 avec elle les diff\u00e9rentes clauses de l'acte. Le juge en premi\u00e8re instance commet une erreur de fait quand il dit que Ia testatrice avertit Mlle Kiddy, le jeudi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, que le notaire viendrait le samedi. C'est 1 intim\u00e9 qui a dit cela \u00e0 Ia testatrice en Ia pr\u00e9sence de Mlle Kiddy.\nN'est-ce pas \u00e9trange que 1 intime ait pu discuter avec sa m\u00e8re, et donner d'aussi longues explications puisque d'apr\u00e8s lui, c'\u00e9tait une affaire entendue? c'est le notaire Hubert qui nous fait part de la discussion qu'il y a eue, et des longues explications donn\u00e9es par le fils, car l'intime, dans son t\u00e9moignage, pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il na pas parl\u00e9 et que c'est le notaire qui a fait tout l'ouvrage.\nLes paroles que le notaire met dans Ia bouche de la testatrice \"qu'llle \u00e9tait contente qu'il y avait beaucoup. trop de mond\u00e9e qui paraissait vouloir vivre au m\u00eame tas,\" me paraissent inexplicables d'apr\u00e8s Ia preuve faite. Evidemment elle faisait allusion a ses filles; cependant, ii n'appert pas qu'aucune d'elles ait sollicit\u00e9 des secours de sa mere ou ait manifeste le d\u00e9sir de partager la succession, en un mot qu'elles aient voulu vivre \"au m\u00e8me las.\"\nAjuutons \u00e0 cela que toute cette affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l'ombre. La m\u00e8re, avoue \u00e0 Mme. McDougall que son fils lui a recommand\u00e9 le secret. Le fils lit que la m\u00e8re lui a recommand\u00e9 le secret. L'acte \u00e9tait fait pour prot\u00e9ger John et cependant on Je cache \u00e0 John. La raison que l'initi\u00e9e donne pour justifier le secret c'est que sa m\u00e8re ne voulait pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9e. Cependant, c'est elle-m\u00eame qui divulgue la transaction a sa dame de compagnie d'abord et ensuite a Mme McDougall, sa tille.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dit l'honorable juge en chef:\u2014\nLe r\u00e9sultat de toute cette affaire, c'est que les filles n'ont recu tout au plus .qu'une somme de $20,000 chacune et les fils une part du vivant de leur p\u00e8re, vaant\" $100,000. . L'intim\u00e9 a retire de sa part $150,000, John, plus maiheureux, a continu\u00e9 les affaires et est arriv\u00e9 a la banqueroute. En outre, Pintim\u00e9 s'est trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir parle transport, en actions de banque, de $32,000 a $36,000, en debentures de Ia ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, $2,000, par remise de son reliquat de compte de son administration, $6,000. De plus une r\u00e9clamation contre la faillite de son fr\u00e8re de $143,000 que lui-m\u00eame \u00e9value \u00e0 $40,000, soit en tout $800000 et si l'on ajoute les $100,000 de 1869, $1800000. Sur cela il faut d\u00e9duire le constitu\u00e2t de $2,000 payable \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, soit $330000, il lui reste une balance de $145000 qu'il se trouve avoir retir\u00e9e des successions de ses p\u00e8re et mere.\nJohn a retire en 1869 la somme de $1000000, plus un constitu\u00e2t de $2,000, soit $1330000 et Ia moiti\u00e9 d'une maison dont je ne connais pas Ia valeur, et les filles n'ont re\u00e7u an plus que la somme de $20,000. Voil\u00e0 une injustice que rien ne justifie. Si Mme Baptist avait eu conscience de ses actes, elle n'aurait pas agi ainsi. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 entretenue dans des id\u00e9es fausses et, dans mon opinion, on a profit\u00e9 de ces erreurs pour lui faire consentir et le transport et le testament. Comme je l'ai dit, en 1885, Mme Baptist n'\u00e9tait pas en d\u00e9mence compl\u00e8te; elle pouvait tenir une conversation avec bon sens. Elle a pu comprendre son fils John, lorsqu'il lui a demand\u00e9 de faire un testament en sa faveur. Elle devait se rendre compte jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point de la faillite et concevoir le d\u00e9sir legitime de prot\u00e9ger John. Elle \u00e8t ait susceptible de concevoir une donation ou transport afin d'assuier sa vie niais elle \u00e9tait trop faible d'esprit pour connaitre l'\u00e9tendue de sa fortune, appr\u00e9cier Ia n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une telle donation, se rappeler les avantages respectifs que ces enfants avaient re\u00e7us dans le pass\u00e9 et se rendre compte de la position relative de chacun d'eux vis-\u00e0-vis de sa succession et de celle de son mari.\n\"Dans toute cette affaire elle a subi l'influence indue de ses fils et particuli\u00e8rement celle de l'intim\u00e9. Elle n'a pas compris Ia port\u00e9e de ce quelle a fait et ses d\u00e9clarations l'attestent\nElle a pu para\u00eetre comprendre, comne l'a dit le notaire Hubert; cependnt, quelques minutes apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du notaire, et de l'intim\u00e9, elle alla trouver Mlle Kiddy sa dame de compagnie, et lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle s'\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e: \" You might have been in the room, and you would have known as much as I do, for it was all in French.\" Le notaire affirme que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit en anglais, les actes son r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais. Elle \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieuse lorsqu'elle parlait ainsi. Elie a bien Pu r\u00e9pondre machinalement aux questions du notaire, lui laisser croire qu'elle comprenait, en pr\u00e9sence de son fils, en qui elle avait une grande confiance, et qui l'avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9e pour la circonstance. Mais d\u00e9gag\u00e9e de l'influence de Ia pr\u00e9sence de son fils, elle a exprim\u00e9 ses v\u00e9ritables impressions. Elle parlait le broad Scotch peu le fran\u00e7ais, et le notaire peu l'anglais, et ii est fort possible qu'elle ait pris son langage pour du fran\u00e7ais, comme elle l'a dit.\nLa testatrice est revenu\u00ba sur le snjet quelque temps apr\u00e8s. Sa conscience Ia tourmentait, bien qu'elle ne put se rendre compte de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Comme elle disait qu'il avait eu tout, Mlle Kiddy, lui demanda \"What have you done?\" et elle r\u00e9pondit \"I do not know myself.\" Une autre fois elle dit: \" I cannot tell you what it is for I do not know myself but I did it for Jack's sake.\" Mile Kiddy ajoute que dans chaque circonstance la testatrice lui a exprim\u00e9 le regret de ce qu'elle avait fait. On voit par cette persistance \u00e0 dire qu'elle avait agi \u201c for Jack's sake \" que son intention n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 que de secourir John, et cependant le transport et le testament \u00e9taient tout au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'appelant, au lieu de celui de John, comme elle le d\u00e9sirait. Cela fait bien voir que ces actes ne sont que le r\u00e9sultat des faux pr\u00e9textes employ\u00e9s par i\u2019 appelant pour obtenir le transport et le testament en sa faveur.\nQuelque temps apr\u00e8s, en janvier 1885, Mile Kiddy a mentionn\u00e9 le fait du transport et du testament \u00e0 Mde McDougall qui lui dit qu'elle en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par sa m\u00e8re. Que celle-ci parlait de sa pauvret\u00e9 ct disait \"I am afraid I did something wrong; Alex, asked me to give all I had and said he would keep me all the time I was living,\" Mde MacDougall lui ayant r\u00e9pondu: \"Why mother, you have enough of Montreal Bank stock to keep you all your life,\" sa m\u00e8re reprit. \" No, I have no bank stock.\" Mde MacDougall ayant fait la remarque qu'ii n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir fait cela, sa m\u00e8re lui r\u00e9pondit. \" I was afraid I was going to be left without anything at all and the best thing was to do this.\" Mde Macdougall lui ayant demand\u00e9: \" Did Alex, ask you to do this? \" elle r\u00e9pondit \" Yes; \" lui ' ayant de plus demande \" Was there any notary there? \" Elle r\u00e9pondit \"There was no notary in the house since your father died,\" en ajoutant que Alex, lui avait recommand\u00e9 le secret.\nCe r\u00e9cit se trouve en quelque sorte confirm\u00e9 par Mde McDougall, car dans sa conversation avec Mile Kiddy, elle fit la remarque qu'il n'y avait pas eu de notaire pr\u00e9sent; mais elle fut inform\u00e9e par Mlle Kiddy que les notaires \u00e9taient venus lors du transport\nUne autre conversation analys\u00e9e par l'honorable juge en chef fait voir jusqu'\u00e0 quel point Ia testatrice ignorait la question de sa fortune et la mani\u00e8re dont elle en avait dispose.\nQueques mois apr\u00e8s cette conversation de .Mde Macdougall avec sa m\u00e8re, la testatrice eut une autre conversation avec sa fille en pr\u00e9sence du rev. M. Currie. Voici comment ce monsieur rapporte cette conversation. Mme McDougall s'adressant \u00e0 lui lui aurait dit: \"Did you think it strange that mother should have disinherited the girls? \" puis se tournant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Mme Baptist: \" Now mother tell Mr. Currie what happened between you and Alex.\" M. Currie reprit de suite. \"No, Madame Baptist, I don't, want to hear anything about the matter I don't want to be in-volved in it at all.\" Et Mme Baptist de lui faire remarquer \"I don't want to get M. Currie into trouble in regard to this affair mais elle ajouta \"Alex, did very wrong I think, it was a great hardship to me.\" M. Currie lui demand\u00e9: \" Did you know that you gave everything to Alex, when you signed that document?\" \"Yes \u201cr\u00e9pondit la testatrice \"but I did not think there was so much, I thought it was some notes or papers in circulation \" et le t\u00e9moin ajoute: \" I am not sure of the words but it was notes or bank shares it struck me as being insignificant.\" Le t\u00e9moin croit se rappeler que Mme McDougall a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re \" How unkindly her mother treated her,\" ajoutant qu'elle ne savait pas ce qu'elle avait fait et que si elle croyait que sa m\u00e8re le sut qu'elle ne retournerait plus la voir. Le t\u00e9moin ne se rappelle pas ce qu'a r\u00e9pondu Madame Baptist, mais ii ajoute qu'elle \u00e9tait in full sympathy with that sentiment\" Mme MacDougall faisant sans doute allusion \u00e0 cette conversation affirme qu'elle s'adressa \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re et lui dit: I If I thought that you would disinherit your daughters I do not see what reason I would have to come near your house again.\" Et Ia testatrice lui aurait r\u00e9pondu \"I have no intention to do that.\"\nUn autre jour la testatrice s'adressant \u00e0 une des servantes lui dit John n'est pas content de l'arrangement mais que tout avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour lui. \" I don't remember, but it was all for his good.\"\nToutes ces d\u00e9clarations prouvent que la testatrice n'avait rien compris aux actes qu'elle avait fait. On voit seulement que les faux motifs donn\u00e9s par l'appelant pour obtenir son consentement sont rest\u00e9s dans sa m\u00e9moire; l'id\u00e9e de prot\u00e9ger John qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inculqu\u00e9e par i\u2019 appelant, et \u00e9viter la mis\u00e8re pour elle-m\u00eame; tandis qu'elle a tout donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant et croit n'avoir cependnt pas donn\u00e9 grand'chose.\nLes filles de ia testatrice ayant fait, sans succ\u00e8s, aupr\u00e8s de leur m\u00e8re et de leur fr\u00e8re des d\u00e9marches pour obtenir des renseignements, s'adress\u00e8rent au notaire Hubert pour avoir des copies des actes qu'il avait faits, mais celui-ci les leur refusa d'\u00e2pres l'ordre qu'il en avait re\u00e7u de l'appelant. Elles furent oblig\u00e9es de demander un compulsoire pour obliger le notaire \u00e0 leur fournir des copies. L'appelant a produit au soutien cet sa contestation de leur demande un affidavit dans lequel la testatrice se d\u00e9clare satisfaite de ce qu'elle a fait. Cet affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 5 novembre 1886, peu de temps avant qu'elle ait dit \u00e0 John qu'elle voulait semer des patates sur la neige et plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s la chute qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 le commencement d'\u00e9carts fr\u00e9quents de sa raison. Au sujet de cet affidavit l'honorable juge eu chef, fait la remarque suivante:\nAussi je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re comme l'expression de sa pens\u00e9e Ia d\u00e9claration spontan\u00e9e qu'elle a faite aux personnes de soi entourage, \u00e0 set affidavit pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'avance et consenti peut-\u00eatre par un signe dette en presence do l'appelant.\nEn 1886 Mde John Baptist lui ayant reproch\u00e9 d'avoir oubli\u00e9 son Marl dans le transport elle lui r\u00e9pond qu\u2019elle lui a laiss\u00e9 la maison et la moiti\u00e9 de ce qu'elle avait. La r\u00e9ponde manque de sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9, par\u00e9e que si la testatrice se rappelait les faits, elle n'a pu dire honn\u00eatement qu'elle donnait \u00e0 John la moiti\u00e9 de sa fortune. Elle ne pouvant dire, \u00e9tant questionn\u00e9e sur le transport, que la maison \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e par cet acte qui n'en fait aucune mention. Mais comme le dit l'honorable juge en chef: \u2014\nLa r\u00e9ponse est pleine d'astuce parse qu'elle est faite de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 calmer les inqui\u00e9tudes de Mme John Baptist. Dans mon opinion elle n'est pas de la testatrice. Si elle l'a faite elle a d\u00fb lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e comme celle faite \u00e0 John dans une circonstance arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 peu v\u00e8rs dans le m\u00eame temps. Vers le milieu de l'ann\u00e9e 1886 John se plaigntit du transport. Sa m\u00e8re lui dit que tout avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour le prot\u00e9ger. Sur cela John lui fit remarquer que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le meilleur moyen de le prot\u00e9ger. La testatrice ne lui r\u00e9pondit pas, Triass le Iendemain elle luidit qu'elle avait consult\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \" That it was all right as she wanted it.\" N'\u00e9tait-ce pas l\u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l'intime m\u00eame?\nL'analyse dc la preuve si compl\u00e8te et si judicieuse faite par l'honorable juge en chef \u00e9tablit clairement par l'ensemble de Ia conduite de la testatrice et les nombreuses d\u00e9clarations qu'elle a faites, qu'elle n'a pas eu une conscience suffisante des actes qu'elle a fait et qu'elle \u00e9tait lors de ces actes dans une \u00e9tat mental qui la rendait incapable de donner un consentement l\u00e9gal\nEn cons\u00e9quence l'appel est renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens TASCHEREAU J.The statement of this case appears in the 21st volume of the reports of this court, p. 425, where our judgment upon a motion to quash the appeal is reported.\nwe have now to adjudicate upon the merit of the controversy between the parties, that is to say, to determine whether or not the late Isabella Cockburn was on the 17th January 1885 of sound intellect so as to be capable to make a will or, to put the case in another shape, whether, under the facts in evidence, the will made by her on that date is to be set aside as obtained by Alexander Baptist by captation and undue influence, when the testatrix was suffering from senile dementia or weakness of mind? The case raises a pure question of fact, or rather, of inferences from facts which I would uselessly detall here. After full consideration of the evidence in the record I have unhesii tatingrly come to the conclusion, notwithstanding the elaborate judgments to the contrary of Mr. Justice Bourgeois, in the Superior Court, and of Mr. Justice Blanchet, in the Court of Queen's Bench, that the reasoning; of the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench is unanswerable, and that the will in question of January, 1885 must be set aside. I have nothing to add to the remarks of the learned judge whose commentaries on the evidence are so full that any attempt on my part to go over the same ground would be mere repetition. 1 would dismiss the appeal with costs distraits to E.

Private Road\u2014Right of passage\u2014Government moneys in aid of\u2014R.S.P.Q. arts. 1716 1717 and 1718 Arts. 407 and 1589 C.C.\nIn an action n\u00e9gatoire the plaintiff sought to have a servitude claimed by the defendant declared non-existent, and claimed $30 damages.\nHeld, that under 56 Vic. ch. 29 s. 1, amending R.S.C ch. 135, s. 29 (b), the case was appealable, the question in controversy relating to matters where the rights in future might be bound. Wineberg v. Hampson (19 Can. S.C.R. 369) distinguished.\nThe plaintiff, proprietor of a piece of land in the parish of Charles-bourg, claimed to have himself declared proprietor of a heritage purged from a servitude being a right of passage claimed by his neighbour the defendant. The road was partly built with the aid of Government and municipal moneys, but no indemnity was ever paid to the plaintiff and the privilege of passing on said private road was granted by notarial agreement by the plaintiff to certain parties other than the defendant.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that the mere granting and spending of a sum of money by the Government and the municipality did not make such private road a colonization road within the meaning of art. 1718 R.S.P.Q.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the superior Court of Lower Canada sitting in review at Quebec confirming the judgment of the Superior Court. This was an action negatoria servitutis by which the appellant prayed that a certain lot of land in the Parish of Charlesbourg, of which he alleged to be the proprietor, be declared free from all servitude of right of way as well on foot as with vehicles in favor of the defendant and of any immoveable to him belonging; that it be declared that it is wrongfully and without any right that the defendant has passed and repassed and pretended having a right to a servitude upon the plaintiffs property, and that the defendant be condemned to pay him the sum of $30.00 for the said damages with costs.\nThe respondent pleaded a general denial, and by perpetual peremptory exception in the following terms:\n1. That there is between the lands of the parties, a colonization road in which the defendant has passed; but the defendant denies having passed upon any part of the plaintiff's property and does not pretend to have any right of servitude upon the same;\n2. That the plaintiff has not had, during the last 30 years a continuous, peaceable and public possession of that part of the land which the defendant considers to be a public road, which road goes alongside of the defendant's property;\n3. That for over 30 years, the public has passed as well on foot as with carriage over the said road, with the plaintiff's knowledge and even in spite of him.\n4. That the said road has been opened with the money of the Government of this Province at the demand of the mayor, of the rate-payers of the municipality and of the plaintiff who has received, from the said Government and municipality, good and valid consideration for the value of the land which he has so ceded for the said road to wit, twenty dollars; the whole within the last five years. 5. That all the interested parties in the said, road the defendant and the plaintiff himself, have worked (paid by the Government) to the construction of the said road and that the said road is ruled by section 1 166 and following of the Consolidated Statutes of Quebec.\n6. That the said road is a land belonging to the crown, and that the plaintiff has, as well as the defendant, no more right to use the same otherwise than as a public road.\nThe plaintiff replied specially that no road was ever opened by proc\u00e8s-vebal on any part of his property and that the crown and municipality did not acquire any right upon his land.\nThe courts below held that the said road having been opened with the aid of the municipal authority and of the Government, and with the plaintiff's consent was a colonisation road opened to the public and that the plaintiff can no more pretend that he remained proprietor of the same.\nUpon motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, the following judgment was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action n\u00e9galoire in which the plaintiff the present appellant claims to have himself declared proprietor of a heritage purged from a servitude being a right of passage alleged to be claimed by the defendant. The action was dismissed by the Court of Review and this is an appeal from that judgment. The plaintiff claims damages to the amount of thirty dollars.\nIn a former cause of Wineberg v. Hampson ([1]) this court held that such an action was- not the proper subject of an appeal to this court. Since that decision, however the law has been amended. As the law stood when Wineberg v. Hampson ([2]) was decided the jurisdiction of the court was held not to attach for the reason that subsection (b,) section 29 of the Supreme & Exchequer Courts Act, R. S. C. cap. 135 conferring jurisdiction in any case wherein the matter in controversy related to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound, did not apply to the case.\nIt was held in Wineberg v. Hampson (1) which was decided in December 1891, that a question as to right of servitude was not a like matter to those specifically mentioned in the clause.\nBy 56 Vic. cap. 29, passed in April 1893, the above mentioned subsection (b.) of section 29, was amended by substituting the word \" other \" for the words s such like\" thus bringing the clause into harmony with article 1178 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec regulating the appeal to the Privy Council. Under this amendment this appeal is clearly admissible. The judgment sought by the plaintiff is one whereby future rights would be bound. The plaintiff seeks by his action to have the servitude claimed by the defendant declared non-existent and should he succeed the right to exercise that servitude in the future would be barred. On the other hand should the plaintiff fail in his action he would be bound to permit the exercise of the servitude in the future.\nThe motion to quash is therefore refused with costs.\nAmyot Q.C. for the appellant then contended upon the merits that he had not been deprived by, any act or consent of his of the ownership of the land in question, the formalities prescribed by law for the expropriation of his property not having been followed, citing and relying on arts. 4077 and 1589 0.C., art. 1718 R.S.P.Q.; corporation of Nelson v. Lemieux ([3]); Dorchester v. Collet ([4]); Doyon v. Corporation of St. Joseph ([5]); Holton v. Callaghan ([6]); Neil v. Noonan ([7]); art. 749 M.0. (P.Q.); King v. Corporation of Ireland ([8]).\nLanguedoc Q.C. for the respondent contended that the respondent claimed no right of servitude on the appellant's property, but that as there is a road on it, which has been in use by the public for over thirty years, which he himself had, for a pecuniary consideration, dedicated to such use and which, having been built by Government aid such road is under arts 1715 et seq. of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, a public road.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le demandeur, appelant, propri\u00e9taire d'une terre d'un arpent de front su:; vingt de profondeur, a vendu par un acte notari\u00e9 du 3 janvier 1890, \u00e0 huit personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es an dit acte, un droit de passage sur la dite terre, tant \u00e0 pied qu'en voiture, \u00e0 toujours sur sa terre, situ\u00e9e dans la paroisse de Charles-bourg, concession sud-ouest du domain de saint-Pierre\nCe passage, on chemin de sortie, devait \u00eatre de quinze pieds de largeur sur toute la longueur de la dite terre, et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 par le dit Fran\u00e7ois Chamberland, qui ne serait tenu de travailler au dit chemin que pen-dant le temps seulement qu'il serait propri\u00e9taire des terres qu'il poss\u00e9dait dans la septieme concession du fief d'Orsainville.\nLes dites parties seraient de plis tenues de placer des barri\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du dit chemin, de les maintenir, et d'en \u00e9riger de nouvelles chaque fois qu'il en serait besoin de les fermer \u00e0 chaque fois qu'ils y passeraient \u00e0 peine de tous frais, dommages et int\u00e9r\u00e9ts. En outre de ces obligations, le droit fut accord\u00e9 pour et en consid\u00e9ration de la somme de $30.00 que le dit Chamberland reconnut avoir re\u00e7ue.\nGet acte est demeur\u00e9 incomplet, n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 que par le demandeur et deux des huit acheteurs.\nLa terre en question est born\u00e9e \u00e0 une de ses extr\u00e9mites, au fief d'Orsainville, o les parties ont des terres qu'ils ne peuvent atteindre par aucun chemin public. Leur but en achetant ce droit de passage \u00e9tait d'attein-dre les terres de ce fief\nCe chemin \u00e9tant difficile et dispendieux \u00e0 construire, les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s demand\u00e8rent et obtinrent de l'aide du conseil municipal qui contribua $20.00 et du gouvernement .provincial qui accorda $50.00 pour le m\u00eame objet.\nCes deux sommes furent pay\u00e9es et employ\u00e9es \u00e0 faire une partie seulement du chemin en question qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9. L'ann\u00e9e suivante, le d\u00e9fendeur, Fortier, dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est contigu\u00eb \u00e0 celle du demandeur, appelant, demanda un bornage qui cut lieu le 27 octobre du consentement des deux parties des bornes furent pos\u00e9es, ainsi qu'il appert par le proc\u00e8s-verbal.\nC'est en se fondant sur ces circonstances que le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend avoir acquis une servitude de passage sumo la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, appelant. Sa pr\u00e9tention est que les contributions du gouvernement et de la municipalit\u00e9 ont eu l'effet de rendre le chemin public.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, le demandeur, appelant, a pris contre le d\u00e9fendeur une action negcatoria, servitutis pour faire d\u00e9clarer sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 libre de toute servitude de passage en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur et pour le faire condamner \u00e0 $30.00 de dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats pour avoir pass\u00e9 et repass\u00e9 sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en pr\u00e9tendant y avoir un droit de servitude\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action par une d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait, et par une exception p\u00e9remptoire, en droit, dans laquelle li all\u00e8gue, 1. Qu'il y a entre les terres des parties un chemin de colonisation dans lequel il a pass\u00e9; li nie avoir pass\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, et d\u00e9clare qu'il ne r\u00e9clame ancun droit de servitude sur la dite terre\n2. Que le demandeur, appelant, n'a pas eu pendant trente ans une possession paisible, continuelle de cette partie de sa terre, que le d\u00e9fendeur consid\u00e8re comme un chemin public qui passe sur la dite terre de l'appelant.\nQue depuis plus de 30 ans le public y a pass\u00e9 tant pied qu'en voiture \u00e0 la connaissance de l'appelant et malgr\u00e9 lui.\nQue ce chemin a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert avec de l'argent de la province, \u00e0 la demande du maire et des contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9, et de l'appelant qui a re\u00e7u du gouvernement et de la municipalit\u00e9 le prix du terrain qu'il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 pour le dit chemin, savoir: la somme de 220.00.\nQue toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans le dit chemin, le d\u00e9fendeur et l'appelant lui-m\u00eame ont travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la construction du dit chemin (pay\u00e9s par le gouvernement) qui est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par la sec. 1716 des statuts consolid\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pav\u00e9s de leur travail avec l'argent souscrit par la municipalit\u00e9 et le gouvernement.\nQue le chemin en question est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne et que le demandeur, aussi bien que le d\u00e9fendeur, n'y out pas plus de droit que dans un chemin public.\nL'appelant a repliqu\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement niant tous les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur et sp\u00e9cialement qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas une des parties \u00e0 l'acte en vertu duquel le demandeur a accord\u00e9e une servitude de passage \u00e0 certaines personnes. Il admet avoir le\u00e7u de l'aide pour la construction du dit chemin mais d\u00e9clare en \u00eatre toujours demeur\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire; que ni la Couronne, ni la municipalit\u00e9 n'ont acquis aucun droit sur ce terrain. Il all\u00e8gue aussi le prot\u00eat notari\u00e9 et le bornage par un arpenteur.\nSe basant sur les faits ci-dessus expos\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9' pr\u00e9tend que la contribution par le gouvernement provincial ou la municipalit\u00e9, \u00e0 Ia construction d'un chemin sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, \u00e0 la demande des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, a l'effet de rendre tel chemin un chemin de colonisation, et de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Couronne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain sur lequel tel chemin est construit et d'en priver le propri\u00e9taire sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de recourir aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'expropriation, voulus par la loi.\nCette pr\u00e9tention est \u00e9videment erron\u00e9e et contraire au code civil art. 487, qui d\u00e9clare:\nNul ne peut \u00eatre contraint de c\u00e9der sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, Si ce n'est pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique et moyennant une juste et pr\u00e9alable indemnit\u00e9.\nDans le cas o\u00f9 des bien-fonds, dit l'art. 1589 C.C.r sont requis pour un objet d'utilit\u00e9 publique, le propri\u00e9taire peut \u00eatre contraint de les vendre, on en \u00eatre expropri\u00e9 sons l'autorit\u00e9 de Ia loi, en la mani\u00e8re et suivant les r\u00e8gles prescrites par les lois sp\u00e9ciales.\nPlusieurs lois sp\u00e9ciales out \u00e9tabli le mode de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour l'expropriation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s requises, soit pour la construction des chemins de fer, on des travaux publics; mais pour ce qui concerne la voirie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les chemins et autres travaux de colonisation et l'arbitrage en cas d'expropriation, c'est dahs d'autres statuts codifi\u00e9s par les C.S.P.Q. qu'il faut aller chercher les r\u00e8glss qui r\u00e9gissent cette mati\u00e8re. Ceux invoqu\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur se trouvent dans les statuts consolid\u00e9s P.Q. et plus particuli\u00e8rement depuis les arts. 1704 \u00e0 1724 qui d\u00e9clarent applicables depuis les arts. 1768 a 1785 et depuis 1889 \u00e0 1842, mutatis mutandis. Les principales dispositions au sujet des chemins de colonisation sont comme suit:\nArt. 1704. Le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil peut de temps en temps designer comme chemins de colonisation, telle ligne de chemin ou projet de chemin qu'il jugera \u00e0 propos c\u2019'ouvrir ou d'am\u00e9liorer, en tout ou en partie, \u00e0 la charge de la province.\nArt. 1705. Tout tel ch min de colonisation est par ordre en conseil, d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme de premi\u00e8re, seconde ou troisi\u00e8me classe, suivant le cas.\nPar l'art. 1710, une municipalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par ordre en conseil int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans un chemin de colonisation et appel\u00e9e \u00e0 v contribuer et l'art 1713 dit que tels chemins le colonisation ou partie 'iiceux, qui se trouvent dans les limites de '.a municipalit\u00e9, ne seront pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s des travaux publics d'apr\u00e8s le code municipal, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s tels par ordre du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\nAucun ordre en conseil n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 au sujet du chemin dont li s'agit en cette cause. Il est rest\u00e9 chemin priv\u00e9. La paroisse de Charlesbourg dans laquelle li se trouve est une municipalit\u00e9 (Edits et ordonnances 3 mars 1722, code municipal sec. 2d). Sans un ordre en conseil, li n'est pas possible de faire au chemin en question, 1 application des dispositions ci-dessus des statuts consolid\u00e9s, et particuli\u00e8rement des art. 1716,1717 et 1718. Il est \u00e9vident que ces dispositions de la loi, sur lesquelles l'intim\u00e9 Fortier a base sa d\u00e9fense, n'ont point d'application dans le cas actuel, parce que l'ordre en conseil pour les rendre applicables n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9. Cette condition est indispensable.\nL'art. 1715 donne le pouvoir \u00e0 la Couronne ou ses agents de tracer et construire des chemins sur toute terre appartenant \u00e0 qui que ce soit, et l'art. 1716 em met l'entrerions \u00e0 Ia charge de la municipalit\u00e9 et lui donne le pouvoir de r\u00e9gler tel chemin par proc\u00e8s-verbal-Et enfin l'art 1718 qui d\u00e9clare que les terres \u00e0. travers-lesquelles sont trac\u00e9s et construits tels chemins de colonisation, deviennent propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne, et lorsque ces terres sont situ\u00e9es dans un township, li n'est d\u00fb aucune indemnit\u00e9 pour le terrain. La terre de l'appelant n'\u00e9tant pas situ\u00e9e dans un township, mais dans une municipalit\u00e9, li est \u00e9vident que la valeur du terrain doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e au propri\u00e9taire, car li n'y a d'exception que pour celles qui sont situ\u00e9es dans un township.\nQue cc soit dans un township ou dans une municipalit\u00e9, la Couronne ne pent pas plus qu'un particulier prendre possession dun terrain pour un ouvrage public \u00e0 moins d'avoir observ\u00e9 toutes les formalit\u00e9s prescrites par la loi.\nL'article 1724 \u00e9tablit ces formalit\u00e9s. Il d\u00e9clare que les articles 1789 \u00e0 1842 s'appliquent, s'il y a lieu, mulatis mutandis, aux chemins de colonisation mentionn\u00e9s dans cette section. Ces articles d\u00e9finissent les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 suivre dans les cas d'expropriation et \u00e9tablissent un mode d'arbitrage. Des dispositions sont prises pour le paiement des hypoth\u00e8ques. Par l'art. 1790, la Couronne peut faire des offres r\u00e9elles.\nDans le cas actuel rien de tout cela \u00fc'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait Il n'y a pas eu d'expropriation, et li n'y a pas eu de r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9e \u00e0 arbitre ni d'offres faites.\nLa couronne n'a pas m\u00eame pris possession du terrain. Elle n'a donn\u00e9 qu'une contribution \u00e0 la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre pour la construction d'un chemin particulier et n'a absolument rien pay\u00e9 pour le prix du sol occup\u00e9 par le chemin.\nOn peut bien admettre l'\u00e0-propos de cette contribution mais on ne peut pas rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'omission de l'ordre en conseil et de l'arbitrage qui n'ont pas en lieu et qui \u00e9taient cependant des formalit\u00e9s indispensables pour faire de cc chemin priv\u00e9 un chemin de colonisation.\nLes formalit\u00e9s prescrites par nos statuts pour I\u2019 ouverture des chemins et l'expropriation des particuliers pour Ia construction de chemins, doivent \u00eatre rigoureusemen.observ\u00e9es, sous peine de nullit\u00e9, comme l'ont d\u00e9ci- d\u00e9 nos cours ([9]). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette cause qu'une municipalit\u00e9 qui n'observe pas ces formalit\u00e9s sera condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 remettre le terrain expropri\u00e9 et \u00e0 payer des dommages, bien que les formalit\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9manation de l'action. Dans la cause de Corporation de Dorchester v. Collet ([10]) il a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\n1. That a municipal corporation has no right to expropriate an occupier of a portion of his land, in order to open a road in virtue of the general reserve made by the Crown of the right of taking land before having previously appointed valuators to value the land necessary for the road.\n2, That, in spite of that reserve and of the article 906 of the Municipal Code, the occupier is entitled to an indemnity for the land of which he is expropriated.\nEt dans la cause de Doyon v. Corporation de St. Joseph ([11]).\nHeld,\u2014That the formalities prescribed by the statute for the opening of a road and for the expropriation of the individuals must be rigorously followed under pain of nullity.\nLe m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu dans Ia cause de Deal v. Corporation de Philipsburg, par la Cour d'Appel en 1866 ([12]), et encore en 1871 par la Cour d'Appel dans la cause de Hall v. L\u00e9vis ([13]). Une d\u00e9cision semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans la cause de Hollon v. Callaghan par la Cour d'Appel en 1879 ([14]). A la page 672 on trouve une autre d\u00e9cision du m\u00eame genre.\nDans une cause de Neil v. Noonan ([15]) il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la cour de Revision et la cour d'Appel en 1888 \" Qu'un chemin qui n'est pas cl\u00f4tur\u00e9 de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 et qui n'est ferm\u00e9 que par des barri\u00e8res, n'est pas un chemin public, et que le propri\u00e9taire de la terre sur laquelle passe ce chemin, peut forcer son voisin de faire sa part de chemin le long de cette terre. Cette d\u00e9cision est conforme \u00e0 l'art. 749 du Code Municipal. Le chemin est demeur\u00e9 un chemin priv\u00e9. Il n'a que quinze pieds de largeur. Si c'\u00e9tait une route municipale, elle devait avoir vingt-six pieds de largeur d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 750 CM., et l'on pourrait contraindre l'appelant d'en augmenter la largeur. Art. 769 CM.\nL'appelant n'a re\u00e7u que $30.00 pour le droit de passage. C'est beaucoup moins que la valeur de sa terre qu'il a pay\u00e9e $30.00 de l'arpent. La superficie accord\u00e9e pour le chemin forme \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s deux arpents. Mais comme il est demeur\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire du terrain sur lequel le chemin existe, il peut y couper le foin et s'en servir comme p\u00e2turage.\nPour ces raisons il pouvait recevoir moins, mais s'il \u00e9tait expropri\u00e9 pour un chemin public, il faudrait prendre en consid\u00e9ration l'inconv\u00e9nient du public qui le fr\u00e9quenterait, tandis que comme chemin priv\u00e9, li y passe peu de monde, et il a l'avantage de ne pas \u00eatre soumis aux inconv\u00e9nients de l'art. 788 CM. Il ne sera pas expos\u00e9 \u00e0 des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et des dommages pour ce chemin.\nUn autre moyen invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, c'est que l'appelant a donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 Ia construction du chemin en signant la p\u00e9tition adress\u00e9e au gouvernement pour lui demander de l'aide pour Ia construction de ce chemin. Tous les documents produits prouvent qu'il ne sait pas \u00e9crire, mais en admettant m\u00eame qu'il aurait sign\u00e9 cette p\u00e9tition, elle ne contient aucun engagement de sa part de donner le terrain n\u00e9cessaire pour ce chemin. Elle repr\u00e9sente seulement qu'une vingtaine de propri\u00e9taires seraient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l\u00e9urs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, si le gouvernement les aidait \u00e0 construire le chemin sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant. Cette all\u00e9gation n'a rapport qu'aux droits de passage qu'il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans son acte du 3 janvier 1890, et ce droit n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 Qu'\u00e0 la condition de poser des barri\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du chemin, de les remplacer an besoin, et de les fermer chaque fois qu'on y passerait. Son consentement ne va pas au del\u00e0, et \u00e0 moins d'un consentement formel pour la construction d'un chemin public li fallait -absolument avoir recours aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en expropriation. Le jugement d\u00e9clarant tout ce chemin qui n'est fait qu'en partie comme devenu dans ces circonstances un chemin public est contraire au principe consacr\u00e9 par l'art. 407 C.C., qui d\u00e9clare que nul ne peut \u00eatre contraint de c\u00e9der sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, si ce n'est pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique et moyennant une juste et pr\u00e9alable indemnit\u00e9. Ici l'appelant n'a pas \u00e9u\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9. Il n'a re\u00e7u que le prix d'une servitude accord\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques particuliers qui ne lui ont rien pay\u00e9 pour le sol du moins, mais un prix inf\u00e9rieur seulement Pour le droit de passage. S'il ne recevait pas toute; la valeur enti\u00e8re du terrain dont on veut ainsi l'exproprier, ce serait encore une autre violation de l'art. J.0. 4077 qui exige qu'il soit justement et pr\u00e9alablement indemnis\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence l'appel est allou\u00e9 et les conclusions de l'action n\u00e9gative sont aussi accord\u00e9es avec cinq dollars de dommages nominaux avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : G.

On the hearing M. denied the agreement as alleged but admitted that he had agreed to give S. one-eighth of lis interest in the proceeds of the mine when sold, and it having been afterwards sold S. brought another action for payment of such share of the proceeds.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Fournier and Taschereau J J. dissenting, that S. was not estopped by the first judgment against him from bringing another action.\nHeld, also that the contract for a share of the proceeds was not one for sale of an interest in land within the Statute of Frauds.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial for the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nOsler Q.C. and Newcombe for the appellant.\nBorden Q.C. and Mellish for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend who tried this action without a jury ought not to have been reversed, and that the appellant (the plaintiff below) was entitled to recover in respect of the contract upon which he sued.\nThe case is a peculiar one. It is a second action between the same parties relating to the same subject matter. In the former suit the plaintiff alleged that for certain valuable considerations, being the same which he now alleges and proves were the considerations for the promise in respect of which he now seeks to recover, the defendant agreed to give him a one-eighth share in an undivided fourth part of which the defendant was the owner in a gold mine in Nova Scotia. In that cause each party was a witness in his own behalf. The plaintiff there swore that the promise already stated was made by the defendant and that it was so made in consideration of the plaintiff putting in the mine certain useful and valuable machinery at less than it was worth; of the refusal by the plaintiff at the defendant's express request of an offer of a lucrative position in Mexico; the giving by the plaintiff, who was an experienced practical miner, of his time, skill and advice in the management and working of the mine, and in defending the title to the property which was at that time in litigation; and the lending to the defendant money to assist in carrying on the operations of the mine. The plaintiff further proved that he had performed all these valuable considerations. The defendant in his examination swore that he never promised to give the plaintiff any share in the mine itself or to account to him for any share of the profits, but he admitted that he did promise the plaintiff that if and when the mine was sold he would pay him the same share, (one-eighth of the defendant's fourth share) of the proceeds as the plaintiff claimed in the mine itself. The learned judge by whom the first cause, which was a suit in equity before the passage of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, was heard considered that the Statute of Frauds was a defence so far as specific performance of the agreement to convey a share in the mine was concerned, but made a decree for an account of the profits adopting to this extent the plaintiffs account of the bargain. The decree was reversed on appeal by the court in banc upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish a partnership and that judgment was affirmed by this court.\nThe trial of the present action took place before Mr. Justice Townshend, without a jury. The plaintiff gave evidence-precisely to the same effect as that which he had given in the first suit. The defendant did not offer himself as a witness on his own behalf. The plaintiff also proved, as he had done in the former litigation, the performance of the considerations before mentioned, and this was confirmed by the evidence of disinterested witnesses in such a way as to leave no doubt that the defendant did get the benefit of everything that the plaintiff relies on as forming part of the considerations for the contract which he alleges. The evidence of the defendant in the former cause, in which he admitted having made a promise to give the plaintiff the one-eighth of the price obtained for his share in the case of a sale of the mine, was put in and proved. In this evidence, however, the defendant stated that his promise was entirely gratuitous. There can be no doubt on the evidence that the plaintiff did put up for the purposes of the mine machinery worth at least $1,000 and did render valuable service to the defendant such as he says was to be part of the consideration, and did also lend the defendant money for working the mine, all of which must have been mere spontaneous and gratuitous acts on his part if we are to believe the defendant's statement. Upon this evidence the learned judge thought that he was at liberty to infer a contract such as the plaintiff claimed the performance of and gave judgment accordingly for the plaintiff This judgment the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on appeal have reversed, and from their judgment the present appeal has been taken.\nI see no difficulty in point of law in sustaining the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend as regards the existence of such a contract as that learned judge considered to be established. The question is purely one of evidence. There was clear and undoubted proof that the plaintiff had furnished valuable machinery and rendered services to the defendant, all of which he must be deemed to have done gratuitously unless some contract to pay for it is to be inferred. It was not even suggested that there was any reason, arising from any relationship between the parties or otherwise, why the plaintiff should have done all which he undoubtedly did do as voluntary acts of beneficence towards the defendant. It was therefore perfectly reasonable and quite in accordance with what is done every day by juries to imply from this that the plaintiff was to be paid or in some way remunerated. The ordinary implication would of course be that payment upon the principle of a quantum meruit was what the plaintiff was entitled to. But then both the plaintiff and defendant agree in stating that there was an express promise, differing, however, as to whether it was a voluntary promise or mere announcement of an intention to make a present, or to pay for the machinery furnished and the services rendered by a share in the proceeds of the mine. Under these circumstances I do not see that a jury, if the action had been tried by such a tribunal, could have been held to have acted so unreasonably that their verdict must necessarily have been set aside if they had coupled the consideration, which is proved beyond doubt or question, with the promise which the defendant admits he made. This and no more is what Mr. Justice To wnshend did. Why then should his finding be interfered with any more than the finding of a jury would have been? I can see no reason why it was not just as open for the judge as it would have been for the jury to infer a contract from the circumstances and admissions proved before him, and for that reason I am of opinion that his judgment ought to have been upheld.\nTwo points of law were raised. First, it was said that the judgment in the first suit was an estoppel. But one of several answers which suggest themselves is sufficient to dispose of this. We cannot say that there was res judicata inasmuch as the present demand did not arise until the sale of the mine had been completed, and this was not effected until after the final judgment in appeal by which the first suit was disposed of was pronounced. Then it was said that the Statute of Frauds was a defence. The answer to this is that the agreement which is now sought to be enforced was not, as in the former case, one conferring an interest in land but exclusively relating to an interest in money; it is true this money is to arise from the sale of land or of a mining interest, but that on authority can, I conceive, make no difference after the land or money interest has been actually sold. It is not sought to enforce any trust or contract to sell the land; that would have been a different case; here the sale has taken place and the only question is as to a share of the price received.\nThere are many American cases in point. Trowbridge, v. Wetherbee[2] is an express authority showing that in a case like the present to enforce a promise to pay money out of the proceeds of the sale of land brought after the sale has taken place the Statute of Frauds has no application. The cases of Graves v. Graves[3]; Hall v. Hall[4]; and Gwaltney v. Wheeler[5]; also apply strongly in the plaintiff's favour[6].\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I think that the plaintiff's action was rightly dismissed. He is estopped from taking the position he would now take. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and that the judgment of the court of first instance in favour of the plaintiff should be restored. The only real defence to the action urged before us was that the plaintiff's cause of action was estopped and barred by a judgment rendered in favour of the defendant in a former action at suit of the plaintiff which, as was contended, operated as res judicata upon the matter of the present action; but, concurring herein with the learned judge of first instance, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the former action which operates as a bar or estoppel in the present.\nKING J.\u2014I concur in the allowance of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Henry, Harris & Henry.\nSolicitors for respondent: Lyons & Lyons.\n[1] 24 N.

Rolland y. Cassidy ([1]); Cowper Essex y. The Local Board of Acton ([2]); Mayor, &c.,, of Montreal v. Brown ([3]); The Queen y. Brown ([4]) Cripps on Compensation ([5]) and cases there cited; and Owners of P. Caland and Freight y. Glamorgan S. S. Co ([6]).\nEthier Q.C. and Greenshields Q.C. for respondents, cited and relied on Morrison y. Mayor &c., of Montreal ([7]); and Canada Atlantic Railway Co. y. Norris ([8]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014These two appeals were argued together.\nIn 1872 two actions were taken against the City of Montreal, one by Picault & Lamothe, now being represented by the appellants, Oscar Guyon dit Lemoine et al., claiming $300,000, and the other by Sir Hugh Allan, now being represented by his testamentary executors, claiming $136,424. Both actions are based on sec. 7 of 35 Vic. ch. 32 (P.Q.), which allows proprietors of certain lands expropriated by the City of Montreal for the opening of the Mountain Park, to claim by direct action an additional amount over and above that awarded by the commissioners appointed to fix the compensation due on account of the expropriation.\nThe award made to Messrs. Picauut & Lamothe was fixed at $27,500 by Messrs. Atwater & Bulmer, two of the commissioners, the third, Mr. Barsalou, being of opinion that $1000000 should be awarded. The award made to Sir Hugh Allan was unanimously fixed by three commissioners at $13,576. In both cases, the awards of the commissioners were maintained by the Court of Queen's Bench; in the case of Picault & Lamothe, the City of Montreal being the appellants, the judgment of the Superior Court which had increased the award to $100 000 was reversed, and in the case of Sir Hugh Allan, Sir Hugh Allan being the appellant, the judgment of the Superior Court which had dismissed the plaintiff's action was affirmed Both plaintiffs then appealed to this court.\nAs we intimated at the conclusion of the argument these appeals must be dismissed. We clearly could not interfere with the judgment appealed from, more especially in the Allan case where the arbitrators were unanimous and the action has been dismissed in the two courts below, without departing from a well settled jurisprudence.\nIn cases of this nature the court, as in reviewing the verdict of a jury or a report of referees; upon questions of fact cannot reverse unless there is such a plain and decided preponderance of evidence against the finding of the arbitrators or commissioners as to border strongly on the conclusive. And that rule should perhaps be still more strictly adhered to on an arbitrators' award than on a verdict of a jury, as the arbitrators are generally, chosen not only because of their well known integrity, but also because of their experience in such matters, and previous local knowledge. They also view and review the premises as often as they may think it necessary to enable them to form a correct estimate, and must surely be in a better position to determine the exact amount than any court can be, and than were any of the witnesses who gave their opinions in this case.\nThe diversity of opinions as to value to be met with in every such case is not wanting in this one; 36 out of the 37 witnesses of Lemoine fix the value of his property at prices ranging from $191,699 to $655870 and for the city, 38 witnesses fix the same value at prices all the way from $8,000 to $53,000. As regards the Sir Hugh Allan property, 43 of his witnesses say that his land was worth from $132,480 up to $662,400, while for the city 37 witnesses reduce that value to an amount commencing at $8,400 and ending at $39,740, and no doubt each party could have found in the City of Montreal hundreds more of witnesses who would have valued this property either on the maximum or the minimum basis as recquired.\nNow it is obvious to any mind that from the very circumstance that a fact is open to such difference of opinion we must conclude that the decision of arbitrators on such questions can rarely be bettered by a reversal founded on the partial and refracted light of an appellate tribunal, nay, of any court. See In the matter of Pearl Street ([9]); and In the matter of John street ([10])\nThis court has already held in The Queen v. Paradis ([11]) that to warrant an interference with an award of value necessarily largely speculative an appellate court must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that some wrong principle has been acted on, or something overlooked which ought to have been considered by the arbitrators.\nOn the same principle Chief Justice Hagarty, in an analogous case, In re Mack!em and The Niagara Falls Park, ([12]) had previousyy said: \" Fully granting the perfect integrity of the referees and their desire to act with fairness we must at once admit that in arriving at an estimate of amount they possess enormous advantages over any to which we can lay claim.\"\n\"Towrrrant interference, we must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there has been this error, that an award of value necessarily largely speculative is either too much or too little. I cannot possibly see my way to naming any sum, on my own opinion of the evidence which would be a more just and reasonable compensation than that awarded. If I ventured to do so I would have the very unpleasant idea in my mind that I was interfering, to the prejudice of justice, with the opinion of those who had far better opportunities of ascertaining the truth than I enjoy. I am unable therefore to see my way to interfere.\"\nThis was concurred in by Burton, Patterson and Osler JJ.\nAnd Mr. Justice Patterson in another case of the same nature re Bush ([13]) said in the same sense: \" An appeal lies, it is true, on questions of fact as well on questions of law. But when the fact for decision is a matter so peculiarly depending upon estimates and opinions of values, as it is in this case, and when the award represents the conclusions of the persons who have had means of forming an estimate of the reliance that ought to be placed on the testimony adduced which we do not possess, as well as of exercising their own judgment, which they have a perfect right to do, bringing to the task whatever knowledge they may have of the locality and the properties, and their general acquaintance with the subject, as to which we are not expected to deal as experts are are not likely to be better informed than they or more capable of forming a correct judgment, it is obvious that we cannot interfere unless we find that some wrong principle has been acted on, or something overlooked that ought to have been considered.\"\nThe case of Morrison v. Mayor, &c. of Montreal ([14]) is precisely in point. The appeal there before their Lordships arose from the very same expropriation as the one in question here and the fact that in the Lemoine case the arbitrators were not unanimous cannot by itself \"justify an increase of the award. The two cases of the owners of the Caland & Freight v. The Glamorgan SS. Co. ([15]); and Mclntyre & McGavin ([16]); are recent authorities from the highest tribunal in the Empire against the appellant's contentions here. The case of Mussen v Canada Atlantic Railway Co. determined a few weeks ago in the Privy Council ([17]), though not yet reported, is also, I understand, one where the award of the arbitrators, at first set aside by the judgment of the Superior Court, was restored to the original amount awarded.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Robertson Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for respondents : Roy & Ethier.\n[1] 13 App. Cas. 770.\n[2] 14 App. Cas. 153.\n[3] 2 App. Cas. 168.\n[4] 36 L.

(Imp.) c. 19, sec. 1, subsec. 5.\nHeld, also, reversing the judgment of the court below, that there was positive and clear evidence that the \" Oscar and Hattie \" was not used or employed at the time of her seizure in contravention of 54 & 55 Vic., c. 19, sec. 1, subsec. 5.\nAPPEAL from the Exchequer Court of Canada (Admiralty District of British Columbia)[1] .\nThis was an action in rem. for the condemnation of a ship for a contravention of The Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891[2]. The judgment appealed from was delivered by Sir Matthew B. Begbie C.J., Local Judge in Admiralty for the District of British Columbia.\nThe ship \" Oscar and Hattie,\" Thomas Turtle, Master, a British ship registered at the Port of Victoria, sailed from Yaquina Bay, in the State of Oregon, the latter end of February, 1892, for the North Pacific Ocean on a sealing and fishing voyage.\nIn continuance of the object of the voyage the ship continued sealing and fishing in the North Pacific Ocean up to and until the latter end of August, when being short of water and prepared to give up sealing for the season, the ship put about with the object of returning to the Port of Victoria, British Columbia.\nOwing to the shortness of water on board the ship it was found necessary by the captain to put into Gotzleb Harbour, in Attou Island, the western island of the Aleutian group. While engaged there in laying in a supply of water the ship was boarded and seized by an officer, ensign Harrison, and crew from the United States man\u2014of\u2014war \"Mohican.\" The seizure occurred on the 30th day of August, in the evening, about 5 o'clock. Ensign Harrison of the \"Mohican\" overhauled all the papers of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" and took possession of the ship's official log book and the ship's log. The seizing officer and crew remained in charge of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" until the evening of the first day of September. The master of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" in the interim visited the Commander of the \"Mohican\" on board the \"Mohican\" and protested against the seizure.\nNo written communication passed from the officers of the \"Mohican\" or any of them to the master of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" of the reasons for the seizure, but various conversations occurred between them with reference to the same which will be referred to hereafter.\nOn the afternoon of the 1st day of September, in pursuance of orders received from the Commander of the \" Mohican \" and with an officer and prize crew on board from the \" Mohican,\" the master of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" navigated her to the Port of Ounalaska, in the Territory of Alaska. Arriving at Ounalaska the \" Oscar and Hattie \" was taken in charge by the United States man-of-war \" Yorktown,\" who in turn handed over the \" Oscar and Hattie \" to the officers of Her Majesty's Ship \" Melpomene \" some nine or ten days after the arrival of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" at Ounalaska.\nAt the end of such period in pursuance of instructions or orders received from Captain Parr, the officer in command of H. M. S. \" Melpomene,\" the master of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" proceeded from Ounalaska to Victoria, and reported to the Collector of Customs at the Port of Victoria, and the ship was left in charge of the Collector of Customs.\nSubsequently an action for condemnation of the ship \" Oscar and Hattie \" her equipment and everything on board of her, was instituted against the ship for contravention of the act known as the \" Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891,\" the writ in such action being issued on the 22nd day of October, 1892, and it was alleged in the petition in support of such action:\n\"That the ship ' Oscar and Hattie ' was seized by an officer of the \" Mohican \" on the 31st day of August, 1892, at Gotzleb Harbour, Attou Island, being a place within the prohibited waters of Behring's Sea as defined by an Order in Council dated the 9th day of October, 1892, made by Her Majesty the Queen in pursuance of an act of the Imperial Parliament, intituled the Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891.\"\n\"That the said ship sailed from Victoria on the 26th day of January, 1892, fully manned and equipped for the purpose of seal-fishing, hunting, killing and taking seals.\"\n\" That the master of the ' Oscar and Hattie ' was on the 17th day of June, 1892, duly warned by an officer of the United States ship ' Adams ' not to enter the waters of Behring's Sea for the purpose of sealing, and at the same time had delivered to him from the said officer a copy of the Proclamation of the President of the United States, and a copy of the Convention between Great Britain and the United States and a copy of the Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891.\"\n\" That the ' Oscar and Hattie ' was at the time of the seizure as alleged, namely on the 31st day of August, 1892, fully manned and equipped for sealing purposes and was used and employed in killing, hunting, taking or attempting to kill and take seals within the prohibited waters of Behring's Sea.\"\nIn answer to the allegations in the petition the defendant, the owner of the \" Oscar Hattie,\" admitted practically the whole of the allegations except so far as related to the purpose for which the ship was in Behring's Sea, and alleged that such ship was in Gotzleb Harbour, Attou Island, where she was seized, solely for the purpose of obtaining a supply of water and provisions in order to enable her to return to Victoria, and not for the purposes of sealing or attempting to seal as alleged or otherwise, and the said ship was never in prohibited waters for the purposes alleged or otherwise, and that the said ship put into the said harbour being at the time in distress and for the purpose of relieving such distress, and was not in such waters for the pur- pose prohibited by the Order in Council, Prohibitions and Conventions. Whereupon issue was joined and the trial of the issue had on Thursday the 27th day of January, 1892, and judgment was delivered on the 5th day of January, 1893, condemning the ship \" Oscar and Hattie \" and her equipment and everything on board of her as forfeited to Her Majesty in contravention of the act known as the \" Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891,\" and the owners of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" were condemned in costs.\nThe evidence taken at the trial on these issues is reviewed in the judgment of the court below[3], and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nD'Alton McCarthy Q.C. and D. M. Eberts for the appellants contended upon the evidence that the \" Oscar and Hattie \" was not in Behring's Sea at any time during the season of 1892 for any prohibited purpose, and referred to Walker v. Baird[4].\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent contended that the onus was upon the appellant to show by clear evidence that the \"Oscar and Hattie \" was not in Behring's Sea and that the finding of fact of Chief Justice Sir M. Begbie upon the evidence should not be disturbed.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of British Columbia, sitting as local judge in Admiralty for the British Columbia Admiralty District, pronounced in a proceeding in rem against the ship \" Oscar and Hattie,\" whereby that ship and her equipment and everything on board her were condemned as forfeited to Her Majesty for contravention of the act known as the Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891.\nThe \"Oscar and Hattie,\" a British ship registered at port of Victoria and commanded by Thomas Turtle, the sailed from Yaquina Bay in the State of Oregon, on the 18th February, 1892, on a sealing and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean fully equipped for that purpose. The ship continued sealing (as the owners allege) in the North Pacific Ocean and outside the limits of Behring's Sea until the latter end of August, 1892, when, being short of water and prepared to give up sealing for the season, the master put the ship about with the intention of returning to Victoria. Instead of sailing directly for Victoria, however, he put into Gotzleb Harbour, in Attou Island, the western island of the Aleutian group. This harbour is on the north side of the island and beyond all question within the limits of Behring's Sea. The master states that his sole purpose in going into this harbour was to procure a supply of water of which he was short, and he alleges that he was actually engaged in getting water when his ship was boarded and seized by an officer (Ensign Harrison) and a boat's crew from the United States ship\" Mohican\"\nThis seizure was made about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th August, 1892. Ensign Harrison took possession of the ship's papers, including the \"official log-book and the ship's log.\" The seizing officer and crew remained on board the \"Oscar and Hattie\" until the afternoon of the 1st of September. The master of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" in the interval visited the commander of the \"Mohican\" and protested against the seizure. On the afternoon of the 1st of September, in pursuance of the orders of Captain Johnson of the \"Mohican\" the \"Oscar and Hattie\" sailed for Ounalaska with an officer and prize crew from the \"Mohican\" on board. On her arrival at Ounalaska the ship was taken in charge by the United States ship\u2014of\u2014war \"Yorktown,\" by whose commanding officer she was subsequently handed over to the commander of Her Majesty's ship \"Melpomene\" By the orders of Captain Parr of the \" Melpomene,\" the master of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" proceeded from Ounalaska to Victoria, and reported to the Collector of Customs at that port, to whom the ship was then delivered up.\nSoon afterwards the present action for condemnation was commenced, it being contended on behalf of the Crown that the ship had incurred forfeiture for an infraction of the Behring Sea Act, 1891, in that she had been found in Behring's Sea within prohibited limits, with shooting implements and seal skins on board. The master of the \"Oscar and Hattie,\" Captain Turtle, was examined on behalf of the claimants, the owners of the ship ; his evidence was not however, taken in open court, but before an examiner. Captain Johnson of the \" Mohican,\" and Ensign Harrison, the officer who made the original seizure, were called as witnesses for the Crown and examined before the Chief Justice, and one Joseph Brown, who had been on board the ship during the voyage as a hunter, was called as a witness for the claimants, and also examined before the Chief Justice at the trial. The learned Chief Justice after taking time for consideration pronounced judgment condemning the ship, her equipment, and everything found on board her as forfeited to the crown. From that judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nSubsection 2 of section 1 of the act referred to is as follows:\n(2). While an Order in Council under this act is in force.\n(a) A person belonging to a British ship shall not kill, or take, or hunt, or attempt to kill or take, any seal within Behring's Sea during the period limited by the Order ; and\n(b) A British ship shall not, nor shall any of the equipment or crew thereof, be used or employed in such killing, hunting, or attempt.\nSubsection 5 of section 1 reads as follows:\nIf a British ship is found within Behring's Sea having on board thereof fishing or shooting implements or seal skins, or bodies of seals, it shall lie on the owner or master of such ship to prove that the ship was not used or employed in contravention of this act.\nBy an order of Her Majesty in Council passed on the 9th of May, 1892, under and pursuant to this act, the limits of Behring's Sea were defined and the catching of seals by British ships in Behring's Sea was prohibited. The offence charged against the ship was therefore that she or some of her equipment or crew had been employed in killing, taking, or hunting or in attempting to kill, or take seals within Behring's Sea as defined by the order in council.\nSufficient prim\u00e2 facie proof of this was undoubtedly afforded by the fact that the ship was found within the boundaries of prohibited waters, with shooting implements and seal skins on board. The onus was thus cast on the owners to prove that the ship had not been employed in killing, taking or hunting seals or in attempting to do so within Behring's Sea.\nThe question thus becomes purely one of evidence. Have the claimants by their proofs displaced the presumption arising by force of the 5th subsection of sec. 1 of the act from the conditions under which the ship was found in Behring's Sea?\nThe burden of proof being thus on the claimants, the owners of the ship, it was for them to rebut the statutory inferences arising from the circumstances, and if they have failed in doing this the ship was properly condemned. Their explanation is that the \" Oscar and Hattie \" entered Behring's Sea for the purpose of getting a supply of water, of which she was short, and for no other purpose whatever ; that she had been actually engaged in watering by means of her boats, immediately before being seized by the boat from the \" Mohican \" ; and that no seals were taken by her, nor by any of her equipment or crew within Behring's Sea ; nor was any attempt made to seal within the prescribed limits. Further, that the seal skins on board had been taken in the North Pacific Ocean, outside of Behring's Sea and off Copper Island, where the ship had been sealing during her whole cruise, prior to sailing on her return voyage to Victoria, in the course of which she entered Behring's Sea to get water. In order to establish this case the claimants called in the first place, Thomas Turtle, the master who had commanded the ship during her sealing voyage. Captain Turtle, as I have before said, was not examined in court, nor in the presence of the Chief Justice but before an examiner. If his evidence is not discredited it is, in my opinion amply sufficient to exonerate the vessel from any charge of contravention of the act arising from the legal presumption imposed by the statute. The witness swears that he went into Behring's Sea for the sole purpose of getting water, turning aside for that purpose from his true course on his return voyage to Victoria. He also says most emphatically, as I understand his deposition, that he did not take or attempt to take any seals in Behring's Sea ; that he was actually getting water on board when the officer on the \" Mohican \" seized the vessel ; he also states with sufficient clearness that the seal-skins he had on board had been taken off Copper Island, in the North Pacific, where he had been prior to sailing on his home voyage ; and he deposes that he had not been in Behring's Sea during his whole voyage until he entered it for the purpose of getting water on the 30th of August, the day before his vessel was seized. Captain Turtle candidly admits that during the early part of the voyage he had been warned against Behring's Sea by the United States ship \" Adams,\" for when he sailed from Victoria in January, the Order in Council had of course not been passed, and the exclusion from Behring's Sea under the modus vivendi could not have been known to him but for this notice. He gives the state of the wind and weather as his reason for making the North coast of the Island instead of the South side, which was outside Behring's Sea. The witness further says that he saw no seals near Attou Island, and that there were none there. This evidence by itself, even if not corroborated by other evidence, given by a witness who cannot be discredited by reason of any peculiarity of his demeanour in the witness box since he was not observed under examination by the Chief Justice any more than by ourselves, would, in my judgment be amply sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption and ensure the acquittal of the vessel unless sufficiently countervailed by further proofs on the part of the crown. But this is not all. Another witness is called by the claimants, Joseph Brown, who had been on board the ship as a hunter during the whole voyage. He proves sufficiently that the ship had been engaged in sealing off Copper Island and that the seal-skins on board had been taken there ; that she had been sealing there immediately before she sailed on her return voyage in the course of which she bore up for Attou Island to get water ; that she did take in water there ; that she was not engaged in sealing while in the Attou roadstead, where she had arrived the day she was seized. The Chief Justice puts aside this witness as having given immaterial evidence ; but granting that he knew nothing of the navigation of the ship, he at least shows that there was no sealing at Attou ; that the ship went in there for water ; and that the seal-skins on board had been taken in a different part of the North Pacific from which the ship had sailed some days before reaching Attou ; all of which i most material as confirmatory of the captain's evidence. The Chief Justice does not say that this witness was unworthy of credit, but merely that his evidence was not material, a conclusion in which I cannot agree. Then to rebut this testimony, two witnesses are called on behalf of the crown both of them no doubt entitled to the utmost credit ; Captain Johnson, Commander of the United States Ship \" Mohican \" and Ensign Harrison, the boarding officer who seized the \" Oscar and Hattie.\" Had these gentlemen, or either of them contradicted the testimony of the master in any material point, it might have discredited him entirely ; but so far from material contradiction I find in their depositions most material corroboration of Captain Turtle's account. They show that there were no seals within two hundred miles of Attou Island. They do not, either of them, even suggest that there was any circumstances leading to a suspicion that the \" Oscar and Hattie \" was intended to go further into Behring's Sea for the purpose of hunting seals ; and Ensign Harrison, at least rather confirms the captain's story about water, and both say that he accounted for his whereabouts in Behring's Sea by attributing it to the failure of his supply of water. I am therefore unable to agree with the learned Chief Justice in his conclusion that this evidence for the crown affects the claimants' case in the least degree, save to confirm it.\nSome observations were made by the Chief Justice about the non\u2014production of the log\u2014book in which the entries of the ship's course during the early part of the voyage were supposed to be contained, but the claimants were not responsible for that ; the log\u2014book together with all the other ship's books and papers were seized by Ensign Harrison and handed over to Captain Parr of the \" Melpomene \" at Ounalaska. It was for the crown to have produced this early log-book, or to have shown that no such document could be found amongst the ship's papers. This they failed to do. No inference unfavourable to the claimants can therefore be drawn from this circumstance. The learned Chief Justice thinks that the entry in the log book which was produced, an entry made by the mate, as to the state of the wind when the ship made Attou is inconsistent with the captain's account. Captain Turtle says the wind was north-west: the mate's entry in the log-book alleges it to have been not north but \" northerly.\" I apprehend that the learned Chief Justice was under the impression that the record of the mate was meant to indicate that the wind was due \"north\" but it does no such thing. The Chief Justice seems also to have drawn an inference unfavourable to the claimants from the absence of the mate, but considering the very reasonable and probable excuse offered for his non-production by the learned counsel for the claimants, namely, that it had been impossible to find him, I do not attach any weight to the circumstance. At all events it is quite insufficient to turn the scale against the claimants in whose favour there is such a great preponderance of testimony, as the evidence shows. The claimants have therefore succeeded in proving that the \" Oscar and Hattie \" was not used or employed in contravention of the statute.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the action for condemnation in the Admiralty dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014[Translated]. The ship \"Oscar and Hattie,\" a British ship registered at the Port of Victoria, sailed from Yaquina Bay, in the State of Oregon, the latter end of February, 1892, for the North Pacific Ocean, on a sealing and fishing voyage. Towards the latter end of August when being short of water the master decided to give up sealing and the ship was\n[Page408]\nput about with the object of returning to Victoria, British Columbia.\nIn order to lay in his supply of water Captain Thomas Turtle, who was the master of the ship, found it necessary to put into Gotzleb Harbour, in Attou Island, the western island of the Aleutian group. While engaged there in laying in a supply of water the ship was boarded and seized by an officer, Ensign Harrison, and crew from the United States man-of-war \"Mohican,\" in the afternoon about 5 o'clock of the 30th day of August.\nEnsign Harrison took possession of the ship and of the ship's official log-book and ship's log, and overhauled all the papers and kept them in his possession until the evening of the 1st of September. In the interim the master of the \"Oscar and Hattie\" visited the commander of the \"Mohican\" on board the \"Mohican\" and protested against the seizure. Several conversations took place between them at the time, but no written communication passed. Later on in pursuance of orders received from the commander of the \"Mohican\" the \"Oscar and Hattie \" with an officer and prize crew on board from the \" Mohican \" proceeded to Victoria Harbour and the master reported to the Collector of Customs, and the ship was left in charge of the Collector of Customs.\nThen an action for condemnation of the ship \" Oscar and Hattie,\" her equipment and everything on board of her, was instituted for having sailed into Gotzleb Harbour, Attou Island, being a place within the prohibited waters of Behring's Sea, as defined by an Order in Council, dated the 9th day of October, 1892, made by Her Majesty the Queen in pursuance of an Act of the Imperial Parliament intituled the Seal Fishery (Behring Sea) Act 1891.\nCaptain Turtle had been warned on the 18th June, 1892, by an officer of the United States ship \"Adams\" not to enter the water of Behring's Sea for the purpose of sealing. This officer at the same time delivered to him a copy of the proclamation of the President of the United States and a copy of the convention between Great Britain and the United States, and a copy of the \"Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891.\" In answer to the action, the defendant admitted practically the whole of the allegations, except so far as they related to the purpose for which the ship was in Behring's Sea, and to the contrary alleged that his ship had entered into Gotzleb Harbour solely for the purpose of obtaining a supply of water in order to enable her to return to Victoria, and not for the purpose of sealing, or attempting to seal, in contravention to the rules and regulations agreed upon between the two governments of Great Britain and the United States.\nAfter issue joined and the evidence taken at the trial, a judgment was delivered on the 5th January, 1893, condemning the said ship \"Oscar and Hattie,\" and everything on board of her, as forfeited to Her Majesty in contravention of the act known as the \"Seal Fishery (Behring's Sea) Act, 1891,\" and the owners were also condemned in costs.\nThe only question raised on this appeal is, whether the \" Oscar and Hattie,\" at the time of her seizure, was being used and employed in hunting seals in the prohibited waters of the Behring Sea.\nOn Her Majesty's behalf it is contended that under section 5 of the Seal Fisheries Act, 1891, the onus probandi is upon the owner or master of the ship found in the prohibited waters of Behring Sea to show that the ship was not used or employed in contravention of the act, viz., \" was not used or employed in killing, taking, hunting, or attempting to kill, take or hunt seals.\" If it is true that the law imposes upon the owner of the ship in such a case the obligation to rebut the presumption of guilt which results from the position of the vessel at the time of the seizure, nevertheless it leaves intact the owner's right to rebut such a presumption by positive proof. The owners of the \" Oscar and Hattie \" in my opinion have clearly and positively proved the fact that they had not proceeded into the prohibited waters in view of contravening any of the provisions of the fishery act. Captain Turtle stated in his evidence of the 2nd December, 1892, that he had proceeded to Gotzleb Harbour for the sole purpose of renewing his supply of water in order to return to Victoria from his sealing expedition in the Northern Pacific. When he arrived at Gotzleb, the weather was stormy and there was a heavy sea. He went there because it was the only place where he could go. \"The wind was very strong and it was impossible for me to get around to the south side of the island.\" Arriving about seven or eight o'clock in the morning he went ashore to see if he could find a suitable place to water at, and about one o'clock began to fill the tanks, and about 5 o'clock Ensign Harrison of the \" Mohican \" seized the vessel. Harrison does not in any way contradict Captain Turtle's statement. When he seized the ship he had a couple of boats tied to the stern of the vessel and one boat was coming from the island with three men. All the guns and other appliances were on the schooner in their ordinary position. In his cross-examination he says he does not think the boats were tied to the stern of the schooner for the purpose of sealing; he does not believe there are ever any seals around this island Attou. Several witnesses confirm the statement that it is not a fishing place, that you must proceed two to three hundred miles further to catch seals. Harrison states that he knows there is a suitable place on Attou Island where a supply of water can be had. He adds: \" there was a heavy swell coming in from the northward and westward.\" Captain Turtle told them that he had been sealing for a month around Copper Islands, but that he had not been sealing in Behring Sea, and that he had gone to Gotzleb Harbour for the sole purpose of obtaining water and that the fishing season for him was closed.\nCommander Johnson of the \" Mchican \" admits that he almost knew immediately after the seizure that he knew that Captain Turtle had been lately sealing in the neighbourhood of Copper Island, but cannot say whether it was Harrison or Turtle who gave him the information. He also states that there are no seals within 200 miles of Attou. The evidence of Captain Turtle is also corroborated by the evidence of Joseph Brown, a hunter on board the \" Oscar and Hattie,\" who says that a long time previous to going for water on Attou Island, the vessel had been employed around Copper Island.\nNow, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, in his reasons for judgment in this case reproaches Captain Turtle, while trying to justify himself, of making use of ambiguous expressions, as follows :\u2014\nI never lowered a boat in Behring Sea \" is an expression which he again repeats, and a third time adopts when repeated to him by his counsel, excepting of course the boats in Gotzleb Harbour, on the 31st August. He uses no other expression of denial.\" He also adds \" that all his words are to be carefully weighed, and it is impossible to carry them further than the dry meaning they express. It is evident that he does not in express terms contradict the charge that he was in Behring Sea attempting to hunt seals and that the schooner was employed for that purpose. All he says is that he, himself, never lowered a boat there.\"\nBut if such answers, which the learned Chief Justice qualifies as evasive, are in truth a denial of the complaint of being there for the purposes of sealing, there can be no reproach made to Captain Turtle for making use of peculiar but very appropriate expressions, as the following extract of his evidence clearly shows and especially if we remember that the hunting of seals with large vessels can only be carried on by lowering the boats fully equipped in order to get at the seals, for it cannot be done from the high deck of a vessel such as the \" Oscar and Hattie.\" The following are the answers I refer to:\u2014\nQ. Never mind what you got from him. Was anything said about seals?\u2014A. He said that he didn't believe I had been sealing at all; he didn't believe I had come into the sea to seal there, he fully believed that I came in there for the sole and whole purpose of getting water.\nQ. Well, had you been sealing in the Behring Sea?\u2014A. No, sir; never lowered a boat in the Behring Sea.\nQ. Well, you had some seals on board, had you, seal\u2014skins?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Where had you been sealing?\u2014A. I took them off Copper Island in the North Pacific Ocean.\nQ. How far off?\u2014A.Various distances; from 100\u2014Objected to by petitioner's counsel.\nA. I never lowered a boat inside the Behring Sea.\nQ. You never lowered a boat in the Behring Sea?\u2014A. No,sir.\nQ. Outside of going into Attou Island, as referred to.\u2014A. No,sir.\nQ. Had you shot any seals there, or killed any in any way, without lowering a boat?\u2014A. No,sir.\nQ. Could not?\u2014A. No,sir.\nAnd again at the close of his testimony in re\u2014cross examination by counsel on behalf of the crown he answers as follows:\u2014\nQ. (Mr. Pooley) And you did not take any whilst in there?\u2014A. No,sir.\nQ. (Mr. Pooley) You say you did not go in for the purpose of taking seals?\u2014A. No,sir.\nQ. (Mr. Pooley) Into the Behring Sea?\u2014No,sir.\nIt is difficult for me to understand how after these several specific denials the learned Chief Justice still hesitated to believe that Capt. Turtle had proceeded to Behring Sea on an illegal errand. When it is known that seal hunting can only be carried on in small boats, the answer may be better appreciated. In my opinion, \"I never lowered a boat in Behring Sea\" is a categorical answer to the question: \"Had you been sealing in Behring Sea. It is a complete and perfect denial of the charge of having sealed in Behring Sea. It is twice repeated. Moreover, we see by the answers to the questions above cited that seals are not killed generally except by lowering the boats. Lowering boats is for the purpose of sealing.\nIt is abundantly clear, in my opinion, that there are formal and positive denials of record by Capt. Turtle that he ever intended fishing for seals in Behring Sea contrary to law.\nWhen leaving Copper Island on his home voyage Attou Island was almost on his way and where he might make a stop for the purpose of taking in a supply of water. It is also in evidence that as a matter of fact he did there obtain a supply of water and that it was owing to the strong winds and heavy sea that he was unable to get around to the south side of the island\u2014Attou, which is situated outside of the prescribed waters. The stress of the weather forced him to go to the north side which happens to be within the prohibited waters. On the whole, I repeat it, the evidence seems to show that he had no intention of contravening any of the provisions of the Fishery Seal Act and that he has not in fact been guilty of any infraction of the provisions of the law.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action for condemnation dismissed, the whole with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I take no part in this judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs. Granting that the ship having been taken within the Behring Sea cast upon the appellant the onus of proving that the vessel had not been used and employed in taking seals in the Behring Sea, that onus was completely discharged by the evidence of the officers in charge of the vessel, whose veracity was not assailed in the slightest particular. The evidence established beyond doubt that the vessel was taken almost immediately after she had entered the sea on the north side of one of the Aleutian islands, which constituted the extreme southern boundary of the sea where she had entered for water, and within two hundred miles of which, as was shown by independent testimony, seals had never been known to be taken or seen.\nThe naval officer of the United States who took the vessel and handed her over to the authorities for trial entertained no doubt of the truth of the statement made by the captain of the vessel when taken, as to the purpose for which she had gone to the north side of the island instead of to the south, and had so entered the Behring Sea, namely, the state of the wind at the time, and the wonder is that she should have been taken at all, or being taken, should have been put upon trial.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Eberts & Taylor.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor & Hogg.\n[1] 3 Ex. C. R. 241.\n[2] Sec. 1, subsec. 5 enacts that ; If a British ship is found within Behrings\u2019s Sea having on board thereof fishing or shooting implements or seal skins or bodies of seals, it shall lie on the owner or master of such ship to prove that the ship was not used or employed in contravention of this act.\n[3] 3 Ex.

That a writ of prohibition will not lie against a magistrate acting under secs 1405-1409 R S P. O. in examination of the furs so seized where he clearly has jurisdiction and the only complaint is irregularity in the seizure.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing a judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing a writ of prohibition addressed to the judge of the Sessions of the Peace at Quebec and to P. X. Joannette, a gamekeeper for the district of Quebec.\nThe facts which gave rise to the litigation are as follows :\nOn the first day of July, 1893 the respondent F. X. Joannette game-keeper for the City and County of Quebec was notified that furs liable to confiscation were on board the schooner \" Stadacona\" in the boundaries of the city of Quebec. He went on board the aforesaid schooner showed his commission and ascertained that the furs were there Then he went to the office of the Judge of the Sessions of the Peace and took out a search warrant, according to art. 1420 E. S. Q.\nHe went back on board the schooner \" Stadacona \" and seized, notwithstanding the opposition of the captain and sailors, sixteen boxes of furs, which were removed to a safe place in the police court at Quebec.\nThe following days the parties proceeded to the examination of the said furs. The petitioners were represented by Mr. Hunt, the local agent in Quebec, the chief factor of the appellant company Mr. Mackenzie, and an inspector sent by them. At the time of appointing a third inspector, for part of furs on which petitioners and respondent's inspector disagreed, a writ or prohibition was served on the respondent.\nTo this writ, whereby the legality of all the proceedings and the jurisdiction of the magistrate were called in question, the respondent pleaded the general issue; that he was a game-keeper for the district of Quebec; that he had a right to seize the furs; that the magistrate had \"jurisdiction that the appellants had not pleaded to the jurisdiction before the magistrate; that the appellants had acknowledged the \"jurisdiction by proceeding to the examination of the furs and in naming an expert for that purpose; that at the time of the service of the writ of prohibition, the two experts had examined all the furs and there only remained to name a third expert.\nTo the 5th 6th and 7th paragraphs, being allegations of acknowledgment of jurisdiction by not pleading and by naming an expert, the appellants demurred, and their demurrer was maintained and this part of the plea struck out by Mr. Justice Casault.\nThe magistrate did not appear or plead. Mr. Justice Andrews, in the Superior Court, made absolute the writ of prohibition upon the ground that there was no authority or jurisdiction to issue a search warrant for skins or peltries on board a navigable vessel and that consequently all the proceedings were unlawful and without jurisdiction on the part of the defendants.\nThis judgment was reversed, Boss\u00e9 and Blanchet JJ. dissenting, on two grounds. 1st. That the game-keeper had authority, irrespective of the search warrant which had been issued to seize the furs and peltries on board the schooner; and 2nd. that even if the search warrant were illegal such fact would not render the seizure made under the authority of article 1405 of the revised statutes illegal.\nThe articles of the revised statutes which bear upon the case are the following:\n\"Every gate-keeper shall forthwith seize all animals or birds mentioned in the preceding articles, or any portion of such animals of birds (except the skin when the animal has been killed during the time when hunting is allowed) found by him in possession or custody or in the care of any person during any close season, or which appear to him to Lave been taken or killed during such period or by any of the illegal means set forth in the preceding articles 1402, 1403 and 1404, and bring them before any justice of the peace who shall, if proved that the law has been broken declare them confiscated either in whole or in part for the benefit of the province and condemn the party in whose possession, custody or care such animals or birds have been found to the penalty provided in article 1410.\"\n\u201cEvery gate-keeper may cause to be opened or may himself open in case of refusal any bag, parcel, chest bag trunk or other receptacle outside the limits mentioned in the following article in which he had reason to believe that game, killed or taken during the close season, or peltries or skins out of season, are kept.\"\n\u201cEvery person found guilty of having had or having actually in his possession or keeping or under his care any articles so confiscated or liable to be so shall in each case be condemned to a fine of not less than five dollars but no more than twenty dollars, and in default of immediate payment, to an imprisonment not exceeding three months in the common gaol of the District within the limits whereof the offence was committed or the seizure or confiscation was effected.\"\n\u201cSuch fine shall be disposed of as provided by article 1410. 50 Vic., c. 16 s. 9.\"\n\u201cEvery game keeper, if he has reason to suspect and if he suspect that game, killed or taken during the close season, are contained or kept in any private house, store, shed or other buildings shall make a deposition before a justice of the peace in the form A. of this section and demand a search warrant to search such store, private house, shed or other building and thereupon such justice of the peace is bound to issue a warrant according to form B.\" 49 Vic. c. 25, 12; 50 Vic. c. 16 10.\n\u201cEvery game keeper shall after each seizure and confiscation of peltries or skins, cause to be established as soon as possible by a competent person duly sworn, the condition of the peltries or skins so seized and confiscated, place them in a safe place, and then immediately report to the Department of Crown Lands.\"\nG. Stuart Q.C. for appellant, contended that the judge had no authority to swear experts at the time he did and all the proceedings were irregular and the only remedy was the writ of prohibition. Clarke v. Crowder ([1]) Martin v. Mackonochie ([2]); Jones v. Jones ([3]) ' Blake v. Beech ([4]).\nSections 1405 and 1409 are contradictory in terms and the only jurisdiction which he pretended to exercise was that given by section 1408. There is no authority in that section to issue to search warrant to seize furs or peltries on board a schooner.\nLanguedoc Q.C. for respondent, contended that without a search warrant under articles 140511409 R. S.P.Q. the game keeper has power to seize all furs killed out out of season and that a schooner was within the words of art. 1408, R.S.P Q. As to the prohibition it does not lie when the justice of the peace has jurisdiction and even if it can be said that they were irregularities as to the proper time of the swearing of the experts this irregularity is not a matter of prohibition. Piche v. corporation of Quebec ([5]); Ex parte Gauthier ([6]).\nThe Chief Justice: I have no doubt the Judge of Sessions had jurisdiction, though it may be he was proceeding irregularly, but this is no ground for a prohibition. As regards the interpretation of the act it is clear that section 1405 authorises the seizure and confiscation of skins and peltries; this interpretation is especially clear when read with section 1409. Then such peltries and skins may be seized wherever found. But a game-keeper cannot search a private house, store shed or other building without a search warrant. He could not justify his entry into such places without a warrant, but if he found peltries and skins he might seize them, though if he had no warrant and found no skins he might be a trespasser. There is nothing in the statute exempting skins, furs or peltries aboard a ship or vessel from seizure, or requiring a search warrant to seize on board a vessel or to search a vessel. I repeat there was no want of jurisdiction. That the judge before confiscation swore experts who were proceeding to establish the condition of the furs which under section 1409 is a proceeding to be taken after confiscation at the most amounted to an irregularity for which prohibition is not the appropriate remedy. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This litigation arises out of a seizure of skins and peltries belonging to the appellant company made by the respondent, as gate-keeper, under the provisions of sections 1402 and following, of the Revised Statutes of Quebec in virtue of a search warrant purported to have been issued under sec. 1408 thereof, by the police magistrate at Quebec, acting as a justice of the peace. The seizure having taken place on board of a navigable vessel the appellant caused a writ of prohibition to issue against the magistrate's proceedings on the ground, amongst others, that under that said section it is only in a private house, store, shed or other building, and not in a navigable vessel, that any such skins can be seized under a search warrant and that consequently the seizure made in this case was void. That contention is altogether unfounded and the Court of Appeal rightly rejected it. A search warrant was altogether unnecessary to justify the seizure made by the respondent and the fact that he issued one cannot vitiate proceedings which are other -wise perfectly legal. Another contention of the company, in support of their writ of prohibition, is that the magistrate was proceeding illegally to have the furs examined and confiscated under sec. 1409 without having first issued a summons to the company. That contention was also rejected by the judgment appealed from and whilst we do not see any error in any of the reasons given in the Court of Appeal to dismiss the writ of prohibition, we more specially affirm that judgment upon the ground that the writ of prohibition did not lie in this case, as the subject matter was clearly within the jurisdiction of the magistrate. I refer to the cases, in this court, of Poulin v. Corporation of Quebec ([7]); Motion v. Lambe ([8]); and Pigeon v. The Recorder's Court ([9]); as clear authorities against the appellant's right to a writ of prohibition in this case.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants : Caron, pentland & Stuart\nSolicitor for respondent : T.

Co., whose duty it was to couple cars in the Toronto yard of the Co\u2019y. In performing this duty on one occasion, under specific directions from the conductor of an engine attached to one of the cars being coupled, his hand was crushed owing to the engine backing down and bringing the cars together before the coupling was made. On the trial of an action for damages resulting from such injury the conductor denied having given directions for the coupling and it was contended that W. improperly put his hand between the draw bars to lift out the coupling pin. It was also contended that the conductor had no authority to give directions as to the mode of doing the work. The jury found against both contentions and W. obtained a verdict which was affirmed by the Div. Court and Court of Appeal.\nHeld, per Fournier, Taschereau and Sedgewick JJ., that though the findings of the jury were not satisfactory upon the evidence a second court of appeal could not interfere with them.\nHeld, per King J., that the finding that specific directions were given must be accepted as conclusive; that the mode in which the coupling was done was not an improper one as W. had a right to rely on the engine not being moved until the coupling was made, and could properly perform the work in the most expeditious way which it was shown he did; that the conductor was empowered to give directions as to the mode of doing the work if, as was stated at the trial, he believed that using such a mode could save time; and that W. was injured by conforming to an order to go to a dangerous place, the person giving the order being guilty of negligence. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2]by which a verdict for the plaintiff at the trial was sustained.\nThe facts of the case and material evidence given at the trial are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nMcCarthy Q.C., for the appellant, contended that there was no evidence of negligence chargeable against the defendant company and cited Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson[3].\nSmyth for the respondent referred to Millward v. Midland Railway Co.,[4]; Smith v. Baker[5].\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In this case concur in the judgment of Chief Justice Hagarty, namely, that we cannot interfere with, however difficult we find it to be to concur in, the finding of the jury upon the evidence. In other words, a successful appeal from the verdict of a jury in matters of this nature is a task so difficult of achievement as to be practically, almost impossible.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014This action is brought under the Workman\u2019s Compensation Act for injuries sustained by plaintiff, a servant in defendant\u2019s employ, through the alleged negligence of one Garland, a person in defendant\u2019s service, to whose orders the plaintiff was bound (as alleged) to conform, and to whose orders he was conforming when the injury was sustained.\nThe plaintiff was a yardman whose duty it was (among other things) to couple cars in the Toronto yard of the Grand Trunk Railway. One Garland was also employed in the yard, and had under his control and direction an engine with its driver, the plaintiff and another. On the day of the accident several uncoupled cars were standing upon the west elevator siding. The engine was on another set of rails, and Garland directed the driver of the engine to go on to the west elevator siding. After giving this order Garland crossed over from the one track to the other in company (as plaintiff says) with the plaintiff, and the two were at the cars on the west elevator siding before the engine backed through the switch. According to the plaintiff the two were standing nearly opposite the ends of the second and third cars when Garland told him to shift the link between these cars, and (according to him) gave precise directions as to the manner of doing this.\nIn the end of each car there is an iron projection for connecting the cars called a draw-bar, with an opening in the end for the admission of an iron link, and a hole above and below through which a pin is passed to hold the link in place. The link is of about one and a half inch iron and about twelve inches in length. When two cars are stationary upon a siding and it is intended to couple them, the link is ordinarily made fast in the draw-bar of the forward car. Then when this car is moved back the free end of the link enters the draw-bar of the rear car and is made fast thereto. If the draw-bars are of the same height and if the link is presented horizontally the entry is readily made, but otherwise it may need to be directed by hand. The pin is sometimes dropped in by the yardman, but frequently he sets the pin beforehand at an angle in the hole of the draw-bar and the concussion causes it to fall into its place, or \u201cmake\u201d as it is termed.\nIn the case before us the link was fastened in the forward draw-bar and the cars were standing so close that the free end of the link was entered into the other draw-bar, but in such a way that the pin could not enter. There was, moreover, a difference in the two pins. That in the forward car was of the more usual pattern and had a sharp or tapered point. The other, known as a \u201cmogul pin\u201d was blunt at the point, and according to plaintiff the chance was that the coupling could not readily be made unless the mogul pin was first put in. In order to do this it became necessary to shift the link, i.e., to make the link fast in the draw-bar of the rear car by use of the mogul pin, leaving the forward end of it free. The distance between the two draw-bars was but four inches, and the shifting of the link required that the pins be taken out and the link moved along further into the draw-bar of the rear car.\nThe plaintiff says that Garland and he, standing at the side of the cars, saw the condition of things, and that Garland gave him instructions to go in and shift the link from draw-bar to draw-bar.\nHe says \u201cyou go in and change that link from draw-bar to draw-bar\u2019 and after you change it, drop the big mogul pin in and place the little sharp pointed pin on top of the draw-bar from which you take the link, so that when the engine is coupled on it will make itself.\u201d\nIn answer to a question on cross-examination the plaintiff stated that the proper way was to have coupled the engine to the forward car, and move ahead slightly, when, the cars being further apart, the link could have been taken cut of the forward and placed in the rear draw-bar, and the coupling then effected by backing the forward car down again; and he further stated that he supposed the particular direction was with the object of saving time. He admits that he was skilled in the work of coupling cars, and that he was not accustomed to get directions as to the mode of doing it, and that Garland had never before given him directions us to the way of doing his work. At the time that the directions were given he saw the engine backing up, and when he stepped between the cars the engine was not over eight or ten feet from the forward car, and moving so slow that she was just about at a stand still, and he says that he expected that Garland would stop the engine. As plaintiff stepped between the cars, Garland went off towards the engine.\nThe evidence of plaintiff was contradicted. Garland denied giving any directions whatever, and two other witnesses corroborated his statement that he was at the forward end of the front car instead of where plaintiff said he was. The jury has, however, in effect adopted plaintiff\u2019s account.\nAs to what took place when plaintiff went between the cars, he was asked:\nHaving got these instructions what did you do? A. When I first entered between the two cars I pulled this little pin out and laid it on top of the draw-bar. Then I put my hand down between the two draw-bars, placed my hand straddle of the link, and commenced to work that link from one draw-bar into the other. Q. And it was while you were doing that that the two draw-bars came together and your hand was crushed? A. Yes.\nThe defendants sought to shew that plaintiff ought not to have used his fingers, but should have shifted the link by moving it along one of the pins. The plaintiff on the other hand says that\nThe only thing you could do was to put your fingers down between the two draw-bars and shift it from one draw-bar to the other. One can see, however, that the mode to be adopted may depend upon whether or not the workman has reason to believe that the cars will not be struck by the engine during the operation. If he has reason to believe that the engine will not strike the cars, clearly he might well proceed in the simplest and most expeditious way, i.e., by the use of the fingers. Of course if plaintiff had known that the engine was to be backed up against the cars he should have kept his fingers away. But his case is that he had reason to suppose that Garland would have prevented the engine from striking the car. Garland clearly had the control of the movements of the engine. This abundantly appears from the evidence of the driver and others. The case, then, is in the same position as if Garland was in fact upon the engine moving it backwards. The first question is: Did Garland direct plaintiff to go in and shift the link as stated by plaintiff? There is evidence on both sides; and the jury having found that the direction was given the finding is to be accepted by us as it has been by the courts below.\nNext; was it impliedly involved in the direction that plaintiff might use his fingers? Mr. Justice Burton grounds his dissent upon this that Garland did not direct plaintiff to move the link with his fingers. I think, however, that in the absence of specific direction the general direction authorizes the doing of the thing in the way reasonably proper for the doing of it; and providing that the engine was not to be moved against the car who can say that it was not proper enough to use the fingers? The doing of the act by the use of a pin would be tedious and I would think almost impracticably so.\nNext: Was Garland empowered to give such instructions? I think that it was within the scope of his authority. If (as stated by plaintiff) the coupling of the cars in a certain way would save time he clearly could direct it to be done in that way. All powers reasonably incidental to the exercise of the general power are to be implied. The case, then, is within Wyld v. Waygood[6] where it was held that liability under the similar provisions of \u201cThe Employers Act\u201d is not limited to an injury resulting from an order which is negligent in itself. The injury here (as in that case) resulted from the plaintiff having conformed to an order when he was told to go to a place which was, and must have been known to be, a dangerous place if the person who told him to go was guilty of negligence.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed and for the reasons given by the majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: John Bell.\nSolicitors for respondent Best & Smyth.\n[1] 20 Ont.

Dorchester (14 O.R. 294.) distinguished.\nOne whose lands in the adjoining municipality have been damaged cannot, after the by-law has been appealed against and confirmed and the lands assessed for benefit, contend before the referee to whom his action for such injury has been referred under the Drainage Trials Act that he was not liable to such assessment, the matter having been concluded by the confirmation of the by-law.\nThe referee has no jurisdiction to adjudicate as to the propriety of the route selected by the engineer and adopted by by-law, the only remedy, if any, being by appeal against the project proposed by the by-law.\nA municipality constructing a drain cannot let water loose just inside or anywhere within an adjoining municipality without being liable for injury caused thereby to lands in such adjoining municipality.\nWhere a scheme for drainage work to be constructed under a valid by-law proves defective and the work has not been skilfully and properly performed, the municipality constructing it are not liable to persons whose lands are damaged in consequence of such defects and improper construction, as tort feasors, but are liable under sec. 591 Municipal Act for damage done in construction of the work or consequent thereon.\nA tenant of land may recover damage suffered during his occupation from construction of drainage work, his rights resting upon the same foundation as those of a freeholder.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the report of a referee to whom the action was referred under The Drainage Trials Act, 1891.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nWilson Q.C. and Smith Q.C. for the appellants. The referee was wrong in the opinion he expressed, on the authority of Stephen v. McGillivray[2], and West Nissouri v. Dorchester[3], that the by-law was invalid for want of a petition from ratepayers in Elma. In those cases the drains were not carried into adjoining townships to find an outlet but for other purposes and so sec. 576 of the Municipal Act did not apply. In the present case that section distinctly authorizes the proceedings. See Chatham v. Dover[4].\nThe Court of Revision confirmed the assessment for benefit on plaintiff\u2019s lands which precludes him from obtaining compensation. Re Pryce and City of Toronto[5]; James v.

Re Priltie and City of Toronto[7].\nIf the work is constructed under a valid by-law there is no liability as for negligence. That is held by our courts and, we submit, by the Privy Council, in Williams v. Township of Raleigh[8]. See also London, Brighton & South Coast Railway Co. v. Truman[9].\nThe by-law must be quashed before an action can be brought and notice of action should be given. Hill v.

It may therefore be retrospective in its operation. Mayor, etc., of Montreal v. Drummond[16].\nThe petition for the by-law was not properly signed which makes it invalid.

The whole matter should be settled by assessment. Re County of Essex and Rochester[23].\nAs to the petition for a by-law see In re White and Township of Sandwich East[24]\nGWYNNE J.\u2014These actions are founded almost wholly upon the same grounds, the former for injury to lot no. 21 in the 14th concession of the township of Ellice, of which the plaintiff Hiles is seised in fee, and the latter for injury to lot no. 20 in the same concession of the same township, of which the plaintiff, Crooks, at the time of the injuries complained of, was in possession as tenant. The statement of claim of the plaintiff Hiles, in short substance, is to the effect that: On the 18th May, 1885, the defendant passed a by-law, no. 198, for draining parts of the township of Ellice, under which, and the schedules thereto attached, they assumed to tax not only lands in the township of Ellice, but also lands in the townships of Elma and Logan; that professing to act under the said by-law they constructed a drain commencing in the township of Ellice, thence along the boundaries of the townships of Elma and Ellice, and of Logan and Elma, into Elma to within about 45 rods from the northerly limit of lots 25 and 26 in the 14th concession of Elma; that the defendants, though professing to construct the drain under the drainage clauses of the Municipal Act, did not observe the legal requirements necessary to give them jurisdiction, in that they did not require a petition to be presented to them signed by a majority of the owners of the lands to be taxed, or whose lands would be benefited by the said works; that the defendants did not carry the drain to a proper or any outlet, but brought in the water from Ellice and deposited it on land in Elma, from whence it spread over lots 25, 24, 23 and 22, in the said 14th concession, into plaintiff\u2019s land, where it remained to the damage of the plaintiff\u2019s lands and crops; that the defendants were guilty of negligence in the construction of the drain in that they provided no proper outlet for the water of the drain, and that they improperly brought large quantities of water from their natural flow into and upon the lands of the plaintiff; that after the said drain was alleged to be completed, and upon the 4th August, 1890, the defendants passed another by-law, no. 265, whereby, after reciting that it was found that the outlet provided by said by-law no. 198 was insufficient, they provided for the construction of a new drain as an outlet from the outlet as provided by by-law 198, across lots 25, 24, 23, 22 and 21 in the said 14th concession of Elma, into a river called the Maitland. That the defendants have assumed to proceed under such last-mentioned by-law and have entered upon plaintiff\u2019s land in lot 21, and have taken part of his land for excavating and constructing said drain therein; that said drain, when constructed, will prove a permanent injury to the land of the plaintiff, and will necessitate the construction and maintenance of many small bridges and crossings; that the said last\u2011mentioned by-law is illegal in that the defendants did not comply with the legal formalities necessary to enable them to continue the said drain; that no petition was presented for the construction or continuation of the same, and the plaintiff further alleges that by reason of the said by-law, no. 198, being bad for the reasons aforesaid, the by-law no. 265 is of necessity void also; and lastly, that the outlet provided is insufficient and improper in that a much better outlet could have been obtained without injuring the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the plaintiff claims $400 damages by the flooding of his land, caused by the work done professedly under by-law no. 198, and $600 damages for injury to his land by the work done professedly under by-law no. 265.\nTo this statement of claim the defendants set up their defence, which it is unnecessary to set out at length, or further than to say that it insisted upon the sufficiency and validity of both by-laws, which the defendants rely upon as their sufficient defence and justification, to which the plaintiff replied by joining issue.\nThe plaintiff, Crooks, in his statement of claim based his action precisely upon the same grounds as the plaintiff Hiles had, in respect of the injuries alleged to have been suffered by him for what was done professedly under by-law no. 198.\nThe defendants relied upon the sufficiency of that by-law and the legality of the work done thereunder, and they insisted that the damages, if any were suffered by the plaintiff, were the proper subject of arbitration under the Municipal Act, and that no application was ever made for such arbitration; that the plaintiff accepted a lease of the land for injury to which the action is brought after the construction of the drain complained of, and with knowledge of all the risks he ran from the operations complained of, and they insisted that he was therefore estopped from making the claim asserted in the action, and finally the defendants claimed the benefit of sec. 338 of ch. 184 R.S.O., 1887.\nUpon the 18th October, 1891, upon motion made by the defendants in the action at the suit of Crooks, an order was made by the court in which it was pending that the said action should be and it was thereby referred to the referee appointed under The Drainage Trials Act, 54 Vic. ch. 51. Now this act appears to me to have been passed for the express purpose of removing obstructions to the administration of justice which sometimes occurred where parties, entitled to recover damages for injuries done to their property by drainage works, brought actions at law to recover such damages instead of proceeding under the arbitration clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act, as required by section 591 of the act of 1883, 46 Vic. ch. 18.\nThe act provides that the Lieut. Governor of Ontario may appoint a referee for the purposes of the Drainage Acts, who shall be deemed to be an officer of the High Court and among other things (sec. 2, subsec. 4) shall have all the powers of an official referee under the Judicature Act;.(subsec. 5) shall also have the powers of arbitrators under the said acts; and shall also have the power of arbitrators under the Municipal Act with respect to compensation for lands taken or injured, and shall likewise have the powers of other arbitrators generally; and (subsec. 6) shall also have as respects proceedings before him the powers of judges of the High Court, including the production of books and papers, the amendment of notices of appeal, and of notices for compensation or damages, and of all other notices and proceedings, the rectification of other errors or omissions, the time and place of hearing, examination and viewing, the assistance of engineers, surveyors or other experts, and as respects all matters whatsoever incident to the trial and decision of matters before him, or proper for doing complete justice therein between the parties.\nBy section 4 the referee is substituted for the arbitrators provided by the Drainage Acts aforesaid.\nBy section 5 claims, matters and disputes which the said enactments provide for referring to arbitration shall be instituted by serving a notice of appeal, or notice claiming damages or compensation, as the case may be, upon the other parties concerned; the notice shall. state the grounds of the appeal or claim, &c., &c.\nBy sec. 11 any action for damages from the construction or operation of drainage works may at any time after the issue of the writ be referred to the said referee by the court or a judge thereof, and by section 19:\nWhere a party brings an action for damages in a case in which, according to the opinion of the court in which the action is brought, or a judge thereof, the proper proceeding is under this act, the court or judge on the application of either party, or otherwise, may order the action to he transferred to the said referee at any stage of the action and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as the court or judge sees fit; and the referee shall thereupon give such directions as to the prosecution of the claim before him as may seem just or convenient, &c., &c.\nI cannot doubt that under this act the referee has the fullest powers of amendment which are possessed by the High Court itself, and that upon the reference of an action to him by the court or a judge, whether it be referred under the 11th or the 19th section, he has full power to deal with the case as he thinks fit, and to make, without any application of any of the parties, all such amendments as may seem necessary for the advancement of justice, the prevention and redress of fraud, the determining of the rights and interests of the respective parties, and the real question in controversy between them, and best calculated to secure the giving of judgment according to the very right and justice of the case, and so if necessary to convert the claim for damages as stated in the statement of claim, if that should he filed before the transfer or reference of the action to the referee, into a claim for damages under section 591 of the act of 1883, as consequential upon the construction of a work authorized by a by-law duly passed under the authority of the statutes in that behalf, and to cause his adjudication thereon to be entered of record for the plaintiff for his damages, if any awarded him, as damages recovered under that section.\nOn the 19th of October, 1891, an order was made by the Common Pleas Division of the High Court in the action of Hiles v. The Township of Ellice whereby it was ordered that that action and all questions arising therein be referred to the referee appointed under the Drainage Trials Act of 1891, pursuant to the provisions of the said act. Accordingly both cases were brought down for trial before the said referee, and evidence of a most exhaustive and much of an irrelevant character appears to have been entered into, for the plaintiffs were allowed to enter into evidence for the purpose of establishing a pretension which they respectively asserted, that it was competent for them to show, either as avoiding the bylaw no. 198 altogether, or as establishing negligence making the defendants liable as wrong-doers even if the by-law should be held to be valid, that the route adopted for the drain as constructed was much inferior to another route which if selected the lots 20 and 21 in the 14th concession of Elma would not have suffered damage; this evidence was apparently offered for that sole purpose, but was wholly irrelevant, for assuming the fact to have been established, it could neither have the effect of avoiding the by-law nor of fixing the defendants with liability as for negligence in construction of the work authorized by the by-law. The petition which was the foundation of the by-law could not be produced, having been lost, but the evidence established beyond doubt, that the work petitioned for was simply the drainage of certain lands in the township of Ellice, and that the petition was signed by a majority of the owners of the lands the draining of which was petitioned for. By the surveyor\u2019s report, which is recited in and made part of the by-law, it appears that he found it necessary to carry a drain constructed for draining the said lands in Ellice into the township of Elma, and he set out the course which he considered to be best for that purpose, \u201cto a branch of the Maitland river in the 14th concession of Elma,\u201d which route, commencing at the said branch of the Maitland river in the said 14th concession, he marked by stakes back to the lands in Ellice proposed to be drained, and being of opinion that certain lands in Elma would be benefited by the construction of such drain he assessed them respectively with amounts which appeared to him to be just and reasonable. No appeal having been taken by the municipality of Elma against his report, plans, assessments or estimates, the council of that municipality passed a by-law for levying from the lands in Elma the amounts so assessed upon them respectively. Thus it appeared that all the proceedings necessary to be taken under sections 570, 576, 578, 579, 580 and 581 of the said act of 1883, which sections have been in force ever since the passing in 1882 of 35 Vic. ch. 26, in order to make the by-law and the work thereby authorized valid were taken and the work was completed as contemplated by the by-law and the surveyor\u2019s report; but upon completion it proved that the branch of the Maitland in the 14th concession which the surveyor designed as and made the outlet of the waters brought down thereto by the drain was inadequate for that purpose, and that in consequence the waters spread over several lots in the 14th concession, and by reason thereof the municipal council of the township of Ellice, upon the 4th day of August, 1890, provisionally passed a by-law numbered 265, whereby, after reciting therein that after the completion of the drain authorized by by-law 198 it was found that the outlet provided by that by-law was insufficient, it was enacted, \u201cpursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Act,\u2019 i.e. section 585 of ch. 184 R.S.O. 1887, which is the same as section 586 of said act of 1883, as amended by section 19 of 47 Vic. ch. 32 (1884), that a new outlet drain from the outlet of the Maitland drain in the creek, that is to say, the outlet of the drain constructed under by-law no. 198, should be constructed to the main Maitland river, crossing several lots, including lot 21 in the 14th concession of Elma, the property of the plaintiff Hiles, according to the report, plans and estimates recited in the by-law. By this by\u2011law lot 21, the land of the plaintiff Hiles, was assessed for benefit in the sum of $38.56. Against this by-law, and the assessment made therein upon the lands in Elma, the municipal council of that township appealed, but the by-law and assessment were confirmed by the arbitrators to whom the appeal was referred under the provisions of the act in that behalf, and thereupon the by\u2011law was finally passed on the 28th September, 1890. Subsequently, and upon the 30th May, 1891, the muncipal council of Elma passed a by-law to levy upon the lands so assessed in Elma the amount of such respective assessments. The only question now arising under this by-law is one in the case of Hiles v. Ellice, and the claim of the plaintiff Hiles therein is solely for the land taken for the drain and for damages occasioned by severance of the land by the drain, and the necessity of erecting and maintaining a bridge or bridges across the drain, &c., &c. Upon these actions, so referred to him, the learned referee has adjudicated and determined to the effect that if he was deciding those cases upon the first impression, and not governed by authority, he would consider the above section 576 of the act of 1883, 46 Vic. ch. 18, to apply to cases like those before him, and that therefore the engineer could properly continue as he did the drainage work into Elma, and assess the lands therein which would be benefited by such work under the provisions of the said section, but that he thought he was concluded by the judgments of the courts in West Nissouri v. Dorchester[25], and Stephen v. McGillivray[26], and upon what he understood to be the authority of those cases he thought the said by-law, no. 198, to be utterly invalid, as passed without any jurisdiction in the municipal council of Ellice to pass it. But he also adjudged and determined that, assuming the by-law to be valid, the defendants were liable as wrong-doers for negligence, as I understand his report, in not providing a proper outlet for the waters brought down by the drain; and because the work was not properly or skilfully performed, but was for a long time left unfinished at lot 25 in the 15th concession of Elma, with a flood of water passing through it and spreading on adjacent lands, whereby some of the water spread upon the lands of the respective plaintiffs; and because he was of opinion that the drain should never have been constructed upon the route adopted, but should have been taken on a wholly different route to the main river Maitland as it passes through lot no. 18 in the 14th concession of Elma. But he further was of opinion, that even though the above findings should be erroneous, and assuming that all damages arising from the construction of the drain constructed under said by-law no. 198 were only recoverable by arbitration under the provisions of the statute, and not by action, he still had power, upon the references made to him under the Drainage Trials Act of 1891, to deal with the cases in that light, and he so adjudicated, and he assessed the damages sustained by the plaintiff Hiles, in consequence of the construction of the drain constructed under by\u2011law no. 198, whether recoverable by proceedings in action or by arbitration under the statute, at the sum of $160, as to the amount of which, assuming the defendants to be liable, there is no complaint, and he assessed the damages sustained from like causes by the plaintiff Crooks at $170, as to which amount neither is there any complaint or objection, assuming the defendants to be liable.\nAs to the damages claimed by the plaintiff Hiles in his action, as sustained by him by reason of the drain constructed under the said by-law no. 265, he found and adjudged as follows. He says:\nApart from any question that might arise in case by-law no. 265 should be held invalid, and assuming these damages were not such as the plaintiff could sue for, but were only such as could be determined by arbitration under sec. 591, &c., of the Municipal Act, but such damages are not referable to me under the Drainage Trials Act, 1891, I think I have authority to deal with the matters upon this reference.\nI find the plaintiff\u2019s damage to be, upon this branch of the case, $110, made up as follows: $80 for loss of land, $40 for fencing and clearing up and grading banks of the drain, and $30 for one substantial bridge, making in all the sum of $150, and I find the plaintiff\u2019s farm is directly benefited by this outlet drain to the extent of $40, over and above the amount assessed against it for Construction; taking this $40 from $150 I find the plaintiff\u2019s damage upon this branch of the case $110, as above mentioned.\nUpon appeal from these judgments and reports of the referee a majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario has maintained the judgments of the referee in both cases in omnibus, and without pronouncing any judgment as to the validity or invalidity of the by-laws, or of either of them, has concurred in the judgment of the referee that upon the proceedings taken before him under the Drainage Trials Act of 1891 it was competent for him to award and adjudge damages to the plaintiffs for the injuries sustained by them respectively, whether prior to the passing of that act such damages could have been recovered only by process in arbitration under the act, or by action at law as for tort. From this judgment the present appeal is taken, the defendants still contending that they are not at all liable, but if they are, that it is still a substantial point which they have a right to insist should be determined, namely, whether they are liable as tort feasors, upon the ground of their by-law being ultra vires, or whether they are only liable under the provisions of the statute as for damages consequential upon the construction of a work legally authorized to be constructed, for that if their liability be only of the latter character the assessments authorized by by-law no. 198 of Ellice, to enforce recovery of which a bylaw was passed by the municipal council of Elma, are still recoverable, whereas if the defendants are liable as tort feasors upon the ground of the invalidity of their by-law, the work constructed thereunder is illegal and the assessments made for payment of the construction of the work are void also, and not only not recoverable in the future, but that those already paid may possibly be recoverable back.\nWith the first impression of the learned referee, and with the opinion expressed upon that point by Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I must say that I entirely concur, namely, that the work contemplated and authorized by the by-law no. 198 was authorized by sec. 576 of the act of 1883, and that the engineer, to give effect to whose report, plans, &c., the by-law was passed, had authority to assess as he did the lands in Elma, and that the said by-law and the by-law passed by the municipal council of Elma to enforce the levying of such assessments upon the lands assessed in Elma are perfectly valid and binding in all respects. Neither Stephen v. McGillivray[27] nor Nissouri v. Dorchester[28] warrants the conclusion drawn from them by the learned referee. Both of these cases rest in great measure upon the same ground. although that in Stephen v. McGillivray27 is more extended than in Nissouri v. Dorchester28. In the former the low lands, to drain which the scheme of drainage proposed was designed, extended over several townships situate in three different counties, not as here in Ellice alone to drain which the necessity arose to carry the drain into Elma, and thereby an incidental benefit was conferred upon lands in Elma. Then the drain in Stephen v. McGillivray27 was not proposed to be, nor could it have been, carried into McGillivray at all, that township lying higher up than Stephen and ten miles from the proposed drain, which was designed to drain the low lands lying in Stephen and the other adjoining townships in different counties, and the engineer who devised the scheme of drainage which Stephen sought to enfore upon McGillivray, assessed McGillivray as for a benefit which he conceived justified that township being made to contribute towards the expense of the work, because, McGillivray being higher up than Stephen, water descended naturally from it into the low lands in Stephen and the other townships proposed to be drained, for which reason, as he conceived, McGillivray would derive benefit; just as in Chatham v. Dover[29], the engineer had assessed the township of Dover and lands therein as for benefit in giving it an outlet, as he termed it, such benefit and outlet consisting only in enlarging the capacity of a natural water course in Dover, by which the lands there assessed were already sufficiently drained, so as to enable it to carry off the extra waters brought down into it by the drain proposed to be constructed in Chatham. In Nissouri v. Dorchester[30], the low lands to drain which the drainage scheme there was designed, lay in both of the above-named townships, instead of, as in Stephen v. McGillivray[31], in three townships in different counties, but the principle upon that point is the same, and is that sec. 576 only applies where the lands proposed to be drained lie in one township only, and that for the drainage of these lands the scheme designed requires that the drain should be carried into a lower township, which work incidentally benefits the lands in such other township. If it does not so benefit such other township the lands in that township cannot be assessed for, or charged with, any portion of the cost of the work, but if it does they can to the extent, but only to the extent, of the benefit so conferred, and the time and place for contesting the question as to benefit or no benefit is before arbitrators, as provided by sec. 582 of the act of 1883. This, as it appears to me, is the effect of the judgment of this court in Chatham v. Dover29.\nThen, as to the finding of the learned referee that the work done under the by-law 198 was not properly or skilfully performed; that it never should have been constructed upon the route upon which it was constructed, as provided in the by-law; that it was not continued to a proper outlet; that it was left for a long time unfinished at lot 25 in the 15th concession of Elma, with a flood of water passing through it and spreading upon adjacent lands, by which means the water was turned loose upon lands in Elma, and some came upon the lands of the respective plaintiffs.\nBy these findings of the learned referee, and the manner in which he subsequently deals with them in his report, I understand him to mean that these circumstances either constitute negligence in the construction of the drain, for which the defendants would be liable in an action at common law, as wrong doers, even if the by-law no. 198 be valid, or at any rate they would be liable, under sec. 591, as for damage \u201cdone to the property of the plaintiffs in the construction of the drainage works, or consequent thereon.\u201d So understanding the learned referee I concur with him, but think that the proper conclusion to be drawn is that the liability of the defendants is under sec. 591, and not as tort feasors at Common law.\nThe fact that an outlet as designed by an engineer for a drainage work and reported by him to a council, and adopted by the council, should prove to be insufficient constituted negligence in the municipality in the construction of the work when adopted by bylaw has never, so far as I am aware, received countenance in the courts in this country, if indeed the contention has ever been seriously raised. No case, so far as I am aware, has arisen wherein it appeared that any engineer or surveyor prepared for the adoption of a municipal council a scheme of drainage work which did not propose an outlet which at least seemed to be sufficient to carry off the waters from the lands proposed to be drained. It has never, I think, been considered by any engineer that the drainage clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act, at any time, authorized the construction of a drainage work which, while taking off water collected on the low lands of A.B.C. and D. provided no outlet whatever for such waters, but proposed to deposit them, or \u201cturn them loose,\u201d to use the expression of the learned referee, upon the lands of other persons, as E.F.G. &c., &c. If Mr. Cheeseman ever entertained that opinion he certainly did not act upon it in the report and plans made by him upon which by-law no. 198 was passed, for in them he plainly designated a stream called by him a branch of the Maitland river in the 14th concession of Elma as the outlet, and as a sufficient one, for carrying off the waters to be brought into it by his proposed drain. In the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, pronouncing the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the present case, I entirely concur, and I have always held the opinion that one township cannot discharge the waters collected within its area, either just inside of, or anywhere in, another township, there to be let loose, without being liable for damages to the parties thereby injured. But in such case the liability would, in my opinion, arise as for an act done without any jurisdiction whatever, utterly ultra vires, and not merely as for negligence in the mode of performing an act legal in itself. I cannot see therefore that section 21 of 49 Vic. ch. 37 (1886), which added some words to the text of section 576 of the Municipal Act of 1883, conferred any power or imposed any duty upon an engineer designing and laying down a scheme for a drainage work which had not already been conferred and imposed by the said section 576, as it had always been, or did anything more than make perfectly plain to the most humble capacity of the lay mind, what to the professional mind was sufficiently plain by section 576 as it previously stood in the act of 1883, and in the statutes of which that act was but a repetition and consolidation. The object appears to me to have simply been to remove any doubt there might be in the minds of any person of the humblest capacity engaged in the administration of the act. Then as to the water suffered to overflow the adjacent lands during the construction of the work, it is to be observed that the work was let by the corporation to an independent contractor, and if any part of the injury done arose from his negligence in the execution of the work authorized by the by-law the corporation cannot in respect of such injury be held liable as tort feasors. I see no intention in the learned referee to distinguish between any overflow during the construction from that which occurred after the completion of the work. All injuries caused from overflowing lands by the waters brought down by the drain are placed upon the same footing and all, as it appears to me, fall under section 591 of the act as damage done \u201cin the construction of the work and consequent thereon.\u201d\nFinally, as to the route selected by the engineer and adopted by the by-law no. 198 not having been the one which, in the opinion of the learned referee, should have been adopted, that is a matter which was not within the jurisdiction of the learned referee to adjudicate upon. That was a point which should have been raised, if at all, as I think, by an appeal against the project as proposed by the by-law 198, and cannot be raised after the passing by the Municipal Council of Elma of a by-law for the purpose of levying the amounts of the assessments upon the lands in Elma to pay their share of the cost of the particular work as defined in the report and plans of the engineer as adopted by the by-law no. 198. In so far, therefore, as concerns the amounts adjudged by the learned referee to the respective plaintiffs for damages done to their lands during construction, and subsequently to the completion of the work, I am of opinion that judgment should be entered for those respective sums, namely, $160 in the case of Hiles, and $170 in the case of Crooks, as for damages sustained by them \u201cin the construction of the drain authorized by the by-law no. 198 and consequent thereon;\u201d and that the record of the judgment should express the recovery as being for such damages.\nI entirely concur in the judgment of the Court of Appeal that Crooks, as a tenant, is as much entitled to recover damages for injury done to him during his occupation as a freeholder would be for like damage. His claim is not at all based upon section 393 of the act of 1883; his right to recover is established upon section 591, which does not qualify his right of redress for any damage done to the land to his injury during his occupation, but affects only the mode in which such redress should be obtained when, and so often as, the injury occurs. His right to recover rests precisely upon the same foundation as does the right of Hiles, in respect of the like damage done to him.\nAs to the amount awarded to Hiles in respect of damage done to his land under by-law no. 265, that by-law, as already pointed out, was passed under, and derives its authority from, sec. 585 of ch. 184 R.S.O. 1887, which is identical with sec. 586 of the act of 1883, after the passing of the act 47 Vic. ch. 32, sec. 19, and not under 49 Vic. ch. 37, sec. 27. Sec. 576 of the act of 1883; equally after the passing of sec. 27 of ch. 37 of 49 Vic. as before, related solely to an original by-law passed in adoption of the report of an engineer for constructing a drainage work upon a petition presented under the statute, by owners of lands in a higher township, in effecting which purpose the engineer found it to be necessary to carry his drain into a lower township; it had no relation to a by-law passed for the purpose of making a new outlet, or improving one already adopted for a drain already constructed under the authority of he act which was the purpose and object of the bylaw 265, and which was authorized solely by sec. 586 of the act of 1883, as amended by 47 Vic., ch. 32 sec. 19, and without any petition being presented therefor. What the learned referee has done in respect of this matter, was to increase the amount imposed upon the plaintiff Hiles, by the by-law 265, for benefit, and then to deduct such increased amount from what the learned referee has estimated to be the damage done to him by the drain, making the amount of such damages to be in excess, not only of such increase in assessment for benefit but of that amount added to the assessment for benefit made by the by-law. The statute which confers jurisdiction upon the learned referee gives him no authority to reopen matters which had already been closed by the provisions of the law as it existed prior to the passing of the Drainage Trials Act; and this matter was, as I think, concluded by the judgment on the appeal taken by the municipality of Elma to the by-law 265, and the assessment on lands on Elma made thereby and by the by\u2011law passed by Elma to levy upon the landholders in Elma those assessments so confirmed by the arbitrators on such appeal. While the case was pending in appeal was, as it appears to me, the time when Hiles should have insisted that he was not assessable for benefit, as I think he was not if the damage done to his property exceeded all benefit conferred upon it by the proposed drain. Hiles cannot, I think, under the circumstances, now claim under sec. 393 as for land taken or injuriously affected by the corporation in the exercise of its powers. In respect, therefore, of this part of the learned referee\u2019s judgment I think the appeal of the defendants in Hiles\u2019s case must be allowed with so much of the costs in the courts below and upon the reference as relates to such portion of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that as to the residue, that as the defendants succeed in their appeal partially, viz., as regards the maintenance of the validity of the by-laws and the variation in the judgment, that it should, in both of the cases, be entered for the plaintiffs respectively as for \u201cdamage done in the construction of the drain as authorized by the by-law no. 198 and consequent thereon.\u201d I think there should be no costs of this appeal on either side.\nI may be excused if I add a few lines for the purpose of correcting an erroneous impression as to my judgment in Williams v. Raleigh[32] which appears to be entertained by my learned brother Mr. Justice Burton, of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThat learned judge, in his judgment in the present case[33], says:\nMr. Justice Gwynne proceeded upon the ground that as the statute was not obligatory, but permissive, the corporation were liable if the effect of, the work was to cause injury to any one, the engineer being their servant. While I disagree entirely from that view it is sufficient at present to say it was not the judgment of the court.\nNow, although this court was divided in Williams v. Raleigh34 upon the construction and application of sec. 583 of ch. 184 R.S.O, and being so divided no judgment was given thereon, I am not aware that there was any substantial difference of opinion in the court upon the main point upon which the judgment of the court proceeded, namely, that the corporation by reason of their wilful neglect to keep in an efficient state of repair the drain called the Raleigh plains drain, which they had made to serve as an outlet to carry off the water brought down into it by the \u201cBell drain,\u201d and by the \u201cdrain no. 1,\u201d they were liable for the damage done to the plaintiff in an action at law, and that the plaintiff was not driven to seek redress by process of arbitration under the statute. The observations in my judgment which are alluded to by my learned brother were made in answer to an argument addressed to us, which appeared to me to receive countenance from some passages in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario when reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson, namely:\nThat when a surveyor has devised a scheme of drainage work it is for the corporation simply to construct it as designed, without incurring any responsibility in so doing.\nThe question to which my observations were so addressed is with preciseness stated at page 116 of the report, and after arguing the point raised by such question, and referring to the clauses of the statute, I wound up at page 118 in these words:\u2014\nThe object of the clauses is to enable lands to be drained for the purpose of cultivation, and to provide means for paying the expense of so doing, and of preserving them (that is the drainage works) when constructed in an efficient state of repair to perform the purpose for which they are designed; there is nothing whatever in any of those clauses to justify the inference that the legislature contemplated or countenanced the idea that water taken from the lands of one person should be so conducted as to be deposited upon the lands of another person.\nAnd I concluded that if they adopted a project having such an object in view they would be responsible for the consequences of such a work, for that as the statute gave them no jurisdiction to pass such a bylaw they could not appeal to the statute for protection.\nI am not aware that my late Brother Patterson, or any of my learned brothers, differed from me in this view, and it is a matter of gratification to find a passage in the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, concurring in it, where he says: \u201cI am unable to accept the argument that one township can collect the water from a large area and discharge it just inside the line of another township where it is let loose, without being liable for damage to those injured.\u201d By adding after the words \u201cjust inside\u201d as above used the words \u201cor anywhere within,\u201d this is the precise conclusion to which my observations led, and I then, at page 117 et seq., proceeded to show that the judgment in favour of the plaintiff needed no such foundation, for that it had a much firmer foundation to rest upon, namely, that the Raleigh Plains drain into which the waters both of the drain no. 1 and of the Bell drain were conducted, were by the wilful neglect and default of the defendants permitted to fall into such a state of disrepair and inefficiency as to be quite incapable of carrying off the waters so conducted into them and to have thereby in fact lost two-thirds of their original capacity; and so that however perfect the Raleigh Plains drain may have been to carry off the waters of the Bell drain when the latter was originally constructed the defendants, by their wilful neglect to perform the duty imposed upon them by statute to keep the Raleigh Plains drain, which they had made the outlet of the Bell drain and other drains, in an efficient condition to do the work imposed upon it, were liable in an action at law, and that damage done to the plaintiff\u2019s land by the overflowing of the Raleigh Plains drain could not, under the circumstances, be fairly said to be \u201cdamage done in the construction of the Bell drain or consequent thereon\u201d so as to drive the plaintiff to seek redress by arbitration under the statute. Their Lordships of the Privy Council, however, have thought otherwise, and have thereby, should the plaintiff feel disposed to incur the expense of the inquiry directed, imposed upon the court of first instance a difficult if not impossible task, namely, where a natural or artificial water course is made the channel of outlet for several streams of water brought down into it from various different sources, and where such channel of outlet, by reason of the neglect of the defendants to fulfil the obligation imposed upon them by statute of keeping it in an efficient condition of repair to carry off the waters so conducted into it, becomes quite inadequate for the purpose and has thereby lost two-thirds of its original capacity, from which cause it overflows its banks and causes much damage to neighbouring lands, to determine how much of the damage so done is attributable to the waters brought down into such channel of outlet from one only of such sources, as distinguished from the damage attributable to the waters brought down from the other sources. Without venturing to call in question the soundness of this judgment, it cannot but appear to the lay mind to be marvellously strange that a party should fail to obtain redress for an admitted injury, upon the ground that he had not pursued the proper course to obtain such redress, although of four of the courts of this country before which the question came three of them, including the learned trial judge who had the peculiar advantage of viewing the premises and observing the precise cause of the damage done, were of opinion that the course pursued was the right one. It is matter, however, of congratulation that in the future the effect of the Drainage Trials Act of 1891 will be to prevent parties suffering damage from drainage works being prejudiced by any such conflict of opinion in the courts as to the proper mode in which redress should be sought for the injuries inflicted. If it has not that effect I cannot see what is its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, and I cannot entertain a doubt that such is the object of the act.\nAppeal in Hiles\u2019s Case allowed in part without costs and dismissed without costs in Crooks\u2019s Case but judgment varied.\nSolicitors for appellants: ldington & Palmer.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mabee & Gearing.\n[1] 20 Ont.

S., in connection with the Intercolonial Railway. The contract contained, among others, the following clauses:\n15. \"The contractor shall not have or make any claim or demand, or bring any action, or suit, or petition against Her Majesty, for any damage which he may sustain by reason of any delay in the progress of the work arising from the acts of any of Her Majesty's agents; and it is agreed that in the event of any such delay, the contractor shall have such further time for the completion of the work as may be fixed in that behalf by the Minister.\"\n35. \"It is distinctly declared and agreed that none of Her Majesty's ministers, officers, engineer, agents or servants, have, or shall have power or authority in any way whatever to waive on the part of Her Majesty any of the clauses or conditions of this contract, it being clearly understood that any change in the terms of this contract to be binding upon Her Majesty must be sanctioned by order of the Governor General in Council.\"\nBy the specifications the piles when in one length were to be of the best North Carolina yellow pine creosoted throughout and when spliced the square upper parts were to be of the same material. One clause of the specifications was as follows:\n8. \"The piles in one length, and square upper parts of spliced piles, including the upper cleat in the splice, as shewn, must contain not less than 16 lbs. per cubic foot of the best dead oil of coal tar creosote, injected under a pressure of from 120 to 160 lbs. per square inch.\"\n\"All piling intended to be creosoted must be heated through with the temperature between 212 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit, have all the air and moisture exhausted, and in that condition receive the creosote.\"\n\"The whole of the work of creosoting must be done in the most approved manner, and. to the satisfaction of the engineer, or inspector, who shall have full power to reject any creosote, or creosoted timber, whether before or after treatment.\" The contractor procured the creosoted pine timber as required and wrote to the engineer asking to have the same inspected in North Carolina before it was shipped, which the engineer agreed to do, but delayed such inspection for some months whereby the suppliant was put to expense in consequence of having to cancel the charter of a vessel engaged to carry it \"from North Carolina and by having to proceed with his work late in the year. He proceeded against the crown by petition of right to recover damages arising from such delay, and the Exchequer Court allowed a demurrer to such petition, holding that he had no cause of action under the contract.\nThe suppliant appealed from that decision.\nPugsley Q.C for the suppliant.\nW. H. B: Ritchie for the crown.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014(Oral). We think this appeal must be dismissed. As regards the objection based on the arbitration clause, the general averment in the petition of right that all conditions precedent were performed is no doubt sufficient answer to that.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court in giving judgment for the crown proceeded upon two grounds, first, that there was no stipulation in the contract obliging the engineer to appoint an inspector, and secondly, that the case comes within the special provision of the contract regarding delay.\nAs to the first ground, it is impossible to say that there was any obligation on the part of the crown to send an inspector, and the engineer had no authority to contract for any inspection of the timber. By the terms of the contract no change therein is to be binding upon the Government unless sanctioned by order of the Governor General in Council, and the statute provides that no contract by any of the servants of the crown shall bind it. This shows that no contract or agreement by the engineer to send an inspector to inspect the timber at the place where it was being prepared could have been obligatory on the crown. Further, there is great force in Mr. Ritchie's contention that in reality the engineer never intended to bind the crown by any such agreement, and that any offer to send the inspector to North Carolina must, on the suppliant's own allegations in the petition, be taken to have been purely gratuitous.\nAs to the other ground, I am of opinion that the crown cannot be held liable for delay caused by the engineer because this ground of complaint is entirely covered by the clause of the contract expressly providing that the contractor should not have any claim against the crown for damages caused by delay.\nUpon all the grounds it appears that the demurrer was properly allowed and the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C. N. Skinner.\nSolicitor for respondent: W. F. Parker.\n[1] 2 Ex. C.R. 403.\n"}

B.N.A. Act, sec. 92, ss. 15.\nThe Lieutenant Governor of a province is as much the representative of Her Majesty the Queen for all purposes of provincial Government as the Governor General himself is for all purposes of the Dominion Government.\nInasmuch as the act 51 Vic. ch. 5 (O) declares that in matters within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of the province all powers etc., which were vested in or exercisable by the Governors or Lieutenant Governors of the several provinces before Confederation shall be vested in and exercisable by the Lieutenant Governor of this Province, if there is no proceeding in dispute which has been attempted to be justified under 51 Vic. ch. 5 (O), it is impossible to say that the powers to be exercised by the said act by the Lieutenant Governor are unconstitutional.\nQu\u0153re: Is the power of conferring by legislation upon the representative of the crown, such as a Colonial Governor, the prerogative of pardoning in the Imperial Parliament only or, if not, in what legislature does it reside?\nGwynne J. dissenting was of opinion that 51 Vic. ch. 5. (O), is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] confirming the order and judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario[2] declaring that it was within the power of the Legislature of Ontario to pass the act 51 Victoria, chapter 5, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Executive Administration of Laws of this Province,\u201d and each and every section thereof.\nThis action was brought under section 52 (2) of the Judicature Act (R.S.O. c. 44), for a declaration touching the validity of the statute of Ontario passed in 1888 (51 Vict. ch. 5) entitled \u201cAn Act respecting the Executive Administration of the Laws of this Province.\u201d The following is the statement of claim filed in the case:\u2014\n\u201c1. The Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada alleges that the act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, 51 Victoria, chapter 5, entitled: \u2018An Act respecting the Executive Administration of Laws of this Province,\u2019 is invalid and of no force or effect, inasmuch as it was beyond the power of the said legislature to pass such statute.\u201d\n2. \u201cThe said Attorney General states that the said statute purports to confer upon the Lieutenant Governor, or the administrator for the time being of the said province, powers, authorities and functions beyond those conferred upon the said Lieutenant Governor or administrator by the British North America Act, and beyond those which it is within the power of the said Legislative Assembly to confer.\u201d\n3. \u201cIt purports also to include in such powers so conferred the right of commuting and remitting sentences for offences against the laws of the province or offences over which the legislative authority of the province extends, and is in this respect beyond the power and authority of the said Legislative Assembly to enact.\u201d \u201c4. The said statute is in contravention of the limitation imposed upon the said legislature by the exception contained in section 92 of the British North America Act, as regards the office of Lieutenant Governor.\u201d\n\u201c5. The said statute purposes either to declare the meaning of or to amend the British North America Act in the matters thereby dealt with and is in either case beyond the competence of the said legislature.\u201d\nThe Attorney General of Ontario demurred on the ground that the act was intra vires.\nRobinson Q.C. and Lefroy for the appellant: The statute having been passed became the subject of certain correspondence between the two Governments, and this correspondence was before the Court of Chancery on the argument, as well as certain other documents which are printed, and these documents we have agreed should be put before this court.\nThis being a case of public character a very full abstract of the argument before the Chancery Division, is given in 20 O.R. 222. Before the Court of Appeal the case was again argued at length, and the argument on the other side, having been taken down in shorthand, my learned friend, Mr. Blake, has had it printed in the form of a pamphlet. We have burs printed also, and we would suggest, with the consent of my learned friend, that without repeating these arguments in detail we hand into court these printed pamphlets, repeating here only the main propositions on both sides, which will have the effect of curtailing very much our present argument. The case is, moreover, of that character that we cannot add anything very new, with this exception, that we find it necessary to say a few words on the late decision by the Privy Council, in 1892, since the argument in the Court of Appeal, of The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver General of New Bruswick[3], which my learned friend conceives has advanced his argument very far, and renders a great part of it unnecessary by confirming the position of the province.\nThe learned counsel then contended that all prerogative powers and functions, not specifically bestowed by the British North America Act upon the Governor General or the Lieutenant Governors, remain, as is expressly stated by sec. 9 of that act, vested in the Queen, and can only be delegated by her through the usual channel of commissions and instructions. He also quoted as part of his argument the view adopted by the Minister of Justice in recommending the disallowance of the Quebec Act, 49 & 50 Vict. c. 98, respecting the executive power, in which he states: \u201cThe office of Lieutenant Governor is one of the incidents of the constitution, and the authority to legislate in respect thereof is excepted from the powers conferred upon the legislatures of the provinces, and is exclusively vested in the Parliament of Canada. In the opinion of the undersigned, it is immaterial whether a legislature by an act seeks to add or take from the rights, powers or authorities, which, by virtue of his office, a Lieutenant Governor exercises. In either case it is legislation respecting his office[4].\nThe learned counsel further contended that the act of the Ontario legislature, now in question, was clearly ultra vires because it assumed to legislate upon all prerogative powers, no matter how high and sovereign a character, so far as such powers had their operation in or had respect to the matters placed within the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces by sec. 92 of the British North America Act. He pointed out that the powers contained in commissions and instructions to Governors and Lieutenant Governors were almost exclusively of a high, sovereign and fundamental character, and not what have been called minor prerogatives. The learned counsel contended that the fact that such prerogatives might in their exercise and operation touch the subjects placed within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction, of the Provincial legislatures, did not bring the prerogative powers themselves within that jurisdiction and that under what has been called the general law of the Empire, colonial legislatures have no right to legislate with regard to them, and that, therefore, the Ontario legislature had no power whatever \u201cthus to enact.\u201d In support of these contentions the learned counsel relied on the points of argument advanced in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nDuring the argument reference was also made to the instructions now received by the Governors General, and it was contended that the power of pardon there given must be exclusive and cannot co-exist in the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces, unless by delegation from the Governor General under the powers in that respect conferred upon him.\nThe learned counsel then referred to the case of the Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver General of New Brunswick[5], and contended that that case left the question involved in the present case unaffected, citing the passage in which the Judicial Committee state that the provisions of the British North America Act: \u201cNowhere profess to curtail in any respect the rights and privileges of the crown or to disturb the relation then existing between the Sovereign and the provinces.\u201d He contended that though that case, no doubt, decides that in matters of Provincial Government the Lieutenant Governor is as much the direct representative of Her Majesty as the Governor General is in matters of Dominion Government, yet the fact remains that both Governors General and Lieutenant, Governors only represent the Queen in a modified manner. The degree to which in either case they represent her depends upon the provisions of the British North America Act on the one hand, and the powers delegated by commissions and instructions on the other hand[6].\nE. Blake Q.C., [\u00c6milius Irving Q.C. with him] for the respondent. \u2014I may conveniently open my argument by referring to that authority to which my learned friends have referred, and which they think does not add much to the position of the province. I would ask your Lordships to consider what the case of the Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver General of New Brunswick[7], does establish, not in the way of stating any new views but as placing in a proper light the position of the province with reference to legislative powers. It appears to me that in that case their Lordships of the Judicial Committee had concluded to make a definite statement of their view of the position of the province, and to place their decision upon a broad and clear view of the result of the previous decisions affecting the rights of the different provinces of the Dominion. There is nothing said in that case at all inconsistent with the decision of this court from which it was an appeal. On the contrary, the decision was affirmative of the view of this court as to the prerogative of the Lieutenant Governor.\nThe judgment in the case referred to at page 441 of the report [1892], A.C., begins by pointing out that \u201cthe appellants did not impeach the authority of the cases of The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia[8], and Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[9]; and they also conceded that until the passing of the British North America Act, 1867, there was precisely the same relation between the crown and the Dominion. But they maintain that the effect of the statute has been to sever all connection between the crown and the provinces; to make the Government of the Dominion the only Government of Her Majesty in North America; and to reduce the provinces to the rank of independent municipal institutions.\u201d In respect to this contention, their Lordships used this language: \u201cfor these propositions, which contain the sum and substance of the argument addressed to them in support of this appeal, their Lordships have been unable to find either principle or authority.\u201d Then there is the authoritative statement that the British North America Act does not \u201cdisturb the relation then existing between the Sovereign and the provinces. The object of the act was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate provincial governments to a central authority, but to create a federal government in which they should all be represented and trusted with the exclusive administration of affairs in which they had a common interest, each province retaining its independence and autonomy. That object was accomplished by distributing between the Dominion and the provinces all powers executive and legislative, and all public property and revenues, which had previously belonged to the provinces; so that the Dominion Government should be vested with such powers, property and revenues, as were necessary for the due performance of its constitutional functions, and that the remainder should be retained by the provinces for the purposes of provincial government. But in so far as regards those matters, which by section 92 are specially reserved for provincial legislation, the legislation of each province continues to be free from the control of the Dominion and as supreme as it was before the passing of the act.\u201d This language is important because there will be found in a subsequent part of the judgment an indication of what will necessarily follow from the idea that the Queen was not present as a part of the Provincial legislature in their legislative acts, and it follows, in the opinion of their Lordships, as a necessary proposition that she was present. Their Lordships say, at page 443 of their report: \u201cIt would require very express language, such as is not to be found in the act of 1867, to warrant the inference that the Imperial legislature meant to vest in the provinces of Canada, the right of exercising supreme legislative powers in which the British Sovereign was to have no share.\u201d And again, in speaking of the objection that the Lieutenant Governor of the province is not appointed directly by Her Majesty, but by the Governor General who has also the power of dismissal, their Lordships say: \u201cThe act of the Governor General and his Council, in making the appointment is, within the meaning of the statute, the act of the crown; and a Lieutenant Governor when appointed is as much the representative of Her Majesty, for all purposes of Provincial Government, as the Governor General himself is for all purposes of Dominion Government.\u201d So you have there a general declaration that the executive powers are divided, and that that part which is necessary for the due performance of the functions of the Provincial Government remains with the province. Then their Lordships in the case in question, after stating, as I have said, that the legislature of each province of Canada is as supreme as it was before the passing of the act, cite from the now historic case of Hodge v. The Queen[10], and then go on to say in reference to the Legislature of New Brunswick, which was in question in that case Maritime Bank v. Receiver General[11], that \u201cit derives no authority from Canada, and its status is in no way analogous to that of a municipal administration. It possesses powers, not of administration merely, but of legislation, in the strictest sense of the word; and within the limits assigned by section 92 of the act of 1867, these powers are exclusive and supreme.\u201d They then go on to say, as I have before said, that the British North America Act should contain very express language (which it does not contain) to deprive the province of its prerogative. What was supposed to be obiter in Th\u00e9berge v. Landry[12], is the deliberate opinion of the Privy Council in this case, namely, that the Queen is a party to provincial legislation.\nIn that case of the Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. Receiver General of New Brunswick12 we find in the judgment the following passage:\nIf the Act had not committed to the Governor General the power of appointing and removing Lieutenant Governors there would have been no room for the argument, which, if pushed to its logical conclusion, would prove that the Governor General and not the Queen, whose viceroy he is, became the sovereign authority of the province, whenever the Act of 1867 came into operation. But the argument ignores the fact that by section 58 the appointment of a Provincial Governor is made by the \u2018Governor General in Council by instrument under the Great Seal of Canada,\u2019 or in other words by the executive officer of the Crown receiving his appointment at the hands of a governing body who have no powers and no functions except as representatives of the Crown,\nand then follows what I have already read on this point.\nThen the judgment proceeds to discuss the point as to the vesting or non-vesting of the public property and revenues of each province in the Sovereign, which their Lordships say appears to be practically settled by previous decisions of the Judicial Committee, referring particularly to Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[13], St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[14], and Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada[15], and the judgment closes as follows:\nSeeing that the successive decisions of this Board in the case of Territorial Revenues are based upon the general recognition of Her Majesty\u2019s continued sovereignty under the Act of 1867, it appears to their Lordships that, so far as regards vesting in the Crown, the same consequences must follow in the case of provincial revenues, which are not territorial.\nThat is important as giving us at last an interpretation on which we can rely for the construction of this case.\n[The learned counsel then proceeded to submit the points of argument relied on in the Court of Appeal[16].]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The 15th subsection of section 92 of the British North America Act and the decision in the case of Hodge v. The Queen[17] preclude the possibility of any doubt as to the right of Provincial legislatures to impose punishments by fine and imprisonment as sanctions for laws which they had power to enact.\nThe case of The Receiver General of New Brunswick v. The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank[18] definitively established that a Provincial Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Governor General under the Great Seal of the Dominion, pursuant to the provisions of the British North America Act, represents the Queen. The 65th section of the British North America Act, which continues to the Lieutenant Governors of the Provinces such statutory powers as to confederation as had previously been vested in the Lieutenant Governors so far as the same are capable of being exercised after the union, does not appear to me to have any material bearing, as the prerogative of pardoning exercised by the Lieutenant Governor before confederation was not derived from any statute.\nHad I been compelled to decide the substantial question argued before this court, I should have had no hesitation in holding that \u201cthe power of commuting and remitting sentences\u201d mentioned in the second section of the Provincial act in question, was nothing less than the power to pardon.\nBy the law of the constitution, or in other words, by the common law of England, the prerogative of mercy is vested in the crown, not merely as regards the territorial limits of the United Kingdom, but throughout the whole of Her Majesty\u2019s Dominions. The authority to exercise this prerogative may be delegated to viceroys and colonial governors representing the crown. Such delegation, whatever may be the conventional usage established on grounds or political expediency, a matter which has nothing to do with the legal question, cannot however in any way exclude the power and authority of the crown to exercise the prerogative directly by pardoning an offence committed anywhere within the Queen\u2019s Dominions. I take it to be the invariable practice, in the case of colonial governors to delegate to them the authority to pardon in express terms, either by the commission under the Great Seal, or in the instructions communicated to them by the crown. This being so, and this practice having prevailed as far as I can discover universally and for a long series of years, I should have thought that it at least implied that in the opinion of the law officers of the crown, an authority on such a point second only to that of a judicial decision, that the prerogative of pardoning offences was not incidental to the office of a colonial Governor, and could only be executed by such an officer, in the absence of legislative authority, under powers expressly conferred by the crown.\nThe next question, and one which was argued on this appeal, and which, if we were compelled to decide all the questions presented we should have been obliged to pronounce upon, is one of the greatest importance, not a question of construction arising in any way upon the British North America Act, but one involving a great principle of the general constitutional law of the Empire. That question is: In what legislature does the power of conferring this prerogative of pardoning by legislation upon a representative of the crown such as a colonial Governor, reside? Is it possessed by any colonial Legislature, including in that term under our system of Federal Government as well the Dominion Parliament as a Provincial legislature, or is it confined to the Imperial Parliament? That the crown, although it may delegate to its representatives the exercise of certain prerogatives, cannot voluntarily divest itself of them seems to be well recognised constitutional canon. Upon this point of the locality of the legislative power to interfere with the Royal prerogative, I should have thought that the case of Cushing v. Dupuy[19] and Re Marois[20], decided by the judicial committee with reference to the jurisdiction of a colonial legislature to limit appeals to the Queen in Council, would, if not direct authorities, have had at least a very material application to the present question. The judgments delivered in the Supreme Court of Victoria in the case of Chun Teeong Toy v. Musgrove[21] might also have afforded us great assistance. If it had been necessary to decide this last question, I should have desired further argument in order that the opinions of the learned judges who decided the Australian case and the authorities which with great industry and research they appear to have brought together might be fully discussed, for that case was not referred to in the argument, having been brought to our notice by the learned counsel for the appellant since the hearing of the appeal.\nI have made the foregoing observations in order that the attention of counsel may be directed to the points I have indicated should the case be brought before us again in some other form. At present I do not intend to decide any of these questions for I am of opinion that we must dispose of this appeal upon the same ground as that taken in the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler.\nThis is an action instituted under the jurisdiction given by section 52, subsec. 2, of the Ontario Judicature Act which is as follows:\u2014\nThe High Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain an action at the instance of either the Attorney General for the Dominion or the Attorney General of this Province for a declaration as to the validity of any statute or any provision in any statute of this legislature, though no further relief should be prayed or sought; and the action shall be deemed sufficiently constituted if the two officers aforesaid are parties thereto. A judgment in the action shall be appealable like other judgments of the said court.\nThe Attorney General of the Dominion by his statement of claim asks for a declaration as to the validity of the statute under consideration and every section thereof.\nWhatever may have been the proper determination of this question, if the statute had been absolute in its terms, it seems to be impossible to say that an enactment which on its face is expressly made subject to a condition that the legislature has power to enact it can be ultra vires. The effect of such a proviso necessarily is that the act is by its very terms to be treated as an absolute nullity if beyond the competence of the legislature; it is therefore impossible to say that there has been any excess of jurisdiction.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nFOURNIEE, J.\u2014Cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e pour faire d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019acte 51 Vict., ch. 5, est ultra vires des pouvoirs de la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019Ontario.

Il me semble que pour adopter un tel proc\u00e9d\u00e9 on aurait d\u00fb attendre qu\u2019il se fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un cas dans lequel cet acte fut invoqu\u00e9. Jusque l\u00e0, il me semble qu\u2019on ne peut demander \u00e0 la cour de faire une d\u00e9claration affirmant ce que la l\u00e9gislature s\u2019est abstenue de d\u00e9clarer. Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 provisoirement ou \u00e0 titre d\u2019essai peut ne pas \u00eatre d\u2019une grande utilit\u00e9, mais \u00e9tait dans les limites de pouvoirs de la l\u00e9gislature. Ainsi que l\u2019a fait observer l\u2019honorable chancelier Boyd dans son savant jugement sur cette cause:\nAnd, again, if the section operates on nothing it may be innocuous, but it is not unconstitutional. We are not called upon by analysis or criticism of plausible powers and functions which may be embraced in the words used to discriminate as to what are within or what without the scope of the enactment; any particular case is to be dealt with as and when it arises.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019action demandant une d\u00e9claration que l\u2019acte en question est inconstitutionnel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e et le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel confirm\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am not sure if we have jurisdiction over this appeal. If not quashed, however, it must be dismissed. There is nothing in it, and I would have dismissed it at the conclusion of the appellant\u2019s argument without calling on the respondent. I would have thought that after the decision of the Privy Council in the Maritime Bank case[22], the appeal would have been abandoned. If it was thought expedient to have a judgment finally settling the questions raised, the case should have been directly brought to the Privy Council. Constitutional questions cannot be finally determined in this court. They never have been, and can never be under the present system.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The act of the Ontario legislature which is under consideration, viz., 51 Vic. ch. 5 is, to say the least, peculiar in its frame and embarrassing and the argument in support of its constitutionality has failed to bring conviction to my mind. The first section of the act purports to enact (\u201cso far as the legislature has power thus to enact\u201d) that all powers, authorities and functions which were vested in, or exercisable by the Governor or Lieutenant Governor of any of the several provinces now forming part of the Dominion of Canada under commission, instructions or otherwise, at, or before the passing of the British North America Act in respect of like matters as the matters by that act placed within the jurisdiction of the legislature of the Province shall be vested in and exercisable by the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Ontario. What may have been the powers, authorities, and functions thus intended to be vested in the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Ontario the section does not indicate; but it must be construed as treating them to have been powers, authorities and functions which had been exercised in virtue of some special authority emanating directly from the crown empowering a Governor or Lieutenant Governor of some or one of the old provinces upon some occasions or occasion to exercise some Royal Prerogative in some manner, and the power, authority or function so authorized to have been executed by such Governor or Lieutenant Governor must have been other than, and in excess of, the powers, authorities and functions vested in the Lieutenant Governors of Ontario and Quebec by sec. 65 of the British North America Act.\nNow the legislatures of the provinces have no jurisdiction to enact laws in relation to any matter not coming within the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 92 of that act and among such subjects there is not one, in my opinion, which includes the matters purported to be enacted by the first section of the act under consideration; but, on the contrary, so to extend the powers, authority and functions of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario beyond those expressly vested in him by the constitutional act is, in my opinion, a violation of the terms of the first item of sec. 92 of that act which vests in the legislature jurisdiction to amend from time to time the constitution of the province save and except \u201cas regards the office of lieutenant governor.\u201d An act which purports to vest in a Lieutenant Governor of the Province the Royal Prerogative in excess of so much thereof as is expressly or by necessary implication vested in him by the British North America Act must, I think, be held to be an alteration of the constitution of the province as regards the office of lieutenant governor. Then it is argued that even if this is a correct construction of the first section and so that it cannot be held to be intra vires, still, by reason of the above formula used in the statute, that section cannot be adjudged to be ultra vires. The argument being: If the legislature has power to enact as it has enacted in the first section that section is intra vires; but if the legislature had not the power so to enact, the section cannot be ultra vires by reason of the saving effect of the formula, \u201cso far as the legislature has power thus to enact.\u201d Thus an act of a Provincial legislature which under the shadow of such a formula deals with a subject clearly not within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to legislate upon, must, according to the argument, be suffered to remain upon the statute book as an act of the legislature, for what purpose it is difficult to conceive. Thus if an act of a provincial legislature should, under the cover of the formula \u201cas far as the legislature has power thus to enact\u201d enact and declare that within the province no offence should be punishable with death but that every offence heretofore so punishable should be punished by imprisonment in a common jail for such period as to the court or judges pronouncing the sentence should seem fit, such an act according to the argument could not be adjudged to be ultra vires but must be suffered to remain on the statute book as an act of the legis- lature. It clearly cannot be said to be intra vires, and I confess to be unable to see how an act which is not intra vires can be anything else than ultra vires.\nThe argument has failed as I have said to bring conviction to my mind. I think that the use of such a formula cannot divest the court of power to pronounce an act to be ultra vires if the subject matter dealt with be not within the jurisdiction of the legislature to legislate upon; that is to say if an act of a provincial legislature deals in any way with such a subject matter the act not being intra vires must be ultra vires. A provincial legislature having no jurisdiction to pass any act in relation to a matter not coming within the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 92 of the British North America Act, if they pass an act in relation to any such matter that is an act beyond their jurisdiction to enact that is to say, is ultra vires, notwithstanding that such a formula as the above is used. The act under consideration, while it contains the above formula, proceeds to legislate upon a subject matter upon which, as I think, it had no jurisdiction to legislate; the formula used does not divest the act of its character of being an act of the legislature nor can it make the subject with which it proceeds to deal to be within its jurisdiction if in point of law it is not. This first section then of the act under consideration is the legislative act of a legislature having no jurisdiction over the subject matter with which the section professes to deal, and being so it is in my opinion ultra vires.\nThen as to the 2nd section. If that section had been framed so as to enact that the lieutenant governor should have the power of commuting and remitting sentences passed under the authority of item 15 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, there would have been I apprehend no objection raised to such an enactment; but the second section does nothing of the kind. It professes to proceed solely upon the basis of the first section being intra vires. It professes not to give to the lieutenant governor power to commute or remit the offences in the second section mentioned independently of the power purported to be conferred by the first section. It enacts as follows:\n2. The preceding section shall be deemed to include the power of commuting and remitting sentences for offences against the laws of this province or offences over which the legislative authority of the province extends.\nThis mode of framing the section conveys the intention of the legislature to have been that it is only under the preceding section that the power mentioned in the second section is vested in and can be exercised by the lieutenant governor. If then the preceding section be ultra vires nothing remains to support the provisions of the second section. But, further, the second section purports to declare that the preceding section and the powers thereby purported to be conferred shall be deemed to include the power of commuting and remitting sentences not only for offences over which the legislative authority of the province extends, that is to say those mentioned in item 15 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, but also \u201cfor offences against the laws of this province.\u201d Such offences were always misdemeanours at common law and now by sec. 138 of the Criminal Code are indictable offences unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided by law, so that this second sec. of the act under consideration purports that the powers professed to be vested in the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by the 1st section shall include the power of commuting and remitting sentences passed in certain cases by the courts in the exercise of their criminal jurisdiction a matter clearly not within the jurisdiction of the pro- vincial legislature to legislate upon, and therefore ultra vires.\nI am of opinion therefore that the contention of the learned Attorney General of Canada is well founded and that the act must be declared to be ultra vires.\nKING J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.A.

The Seal Fishery (North Pacific) Act 1893.\nA Russian cruiser manned by a crew in the pay of the Russian Government and in command of an officier of the Russian navy is a \"war vessel\" within the meaning of the said order in council, and a protocol of examination of an offending British ship by such cruiser signed by the offices in command is admissible in evidence in proceedings taken in the Admiralty court in an action for condemnation under the said Seal Fishery (North Pacific) Act 1893, and is proof of its contents.\nThe ship in question in this case having been seized within the prohibited waters of the thirty mile zone round the Komandorsky Islands, fully equipped and manned for sealing, not only failed to fulfil the onus cast upon her of proving that she was not used or employed in killing or attempting to kill any seals within the seas specified in the order in council, but the evidence was sufficient to prove that she was guilty of an infraction of the statute and order in council.\nJudgment of the court below affirmed,\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (British Columbia Admiralty District)[1] by which judgment the ship \"Minnie,\" her equipment and everything on board of her, and the proceeds thereof, were condemned for violation of the provisions and requirements of the \"Seal Fishery (North Pacific) Act,\" an imperial statute passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, on the 29th June, 1893, and of the Imperial Order in Council, passed in pursuance of the said act on the 4th July, 1894.\nThis was an action for condemnation under the Seal Fishery (North Pacific) Act, 1893.\nThe following are the material facts in the case:\nThe sealing schooner \"Minnie\" set sail from the Port of Victoria, British Columbia, on the 27th of February, 1893, fully equipped and manned for a hunting and sealing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean. On the 22nd of June, 1893, the owner of the vessel, Victor Jacobson, appointed one Julius Mohrhouse as the master of the said ship, and the said Mohrhouse was master at the time of the seizure of the vessel.\nOn the evening of the 17th July, 1893, about nine o'clock, the schooner was seized by the officers of the Russian cruiser \"Yacoute\" as being within the thirty mile zone round the Komandorsky Islands, of which group Copper Island is one. The said Komandorsky Islands are referred to in the second sub-clause of clause one, in the order in council of the 4th July, 1894.\nAt the time of the seizure, the master of the \"Minnie\" was aware of the requirements of the order in council, and of the necessity of keeping outside of the limits of the zone so prescribed by the said order in council. After the seizure the ship was searched by the officers of the Russian cruiser, and a full equipment of guns and other seal-hunting implements were found on board, together with one seal-skin. The catch of the vessel had been transferred to the \"Borealis\" some time previously. On the. day of the seizure all the boats of the \"Minnie\" were lowered, for the purpose alleged by Captain Mohrhouse of washing the decks; but as a matter of fact, two persons expert in sealing were placed in each boat.\nThe sections of the statute 56 & 57 Vic. ch. 23 (Imp.) bearing on the case are the following:\u2014\n\"(1). Her Majesty the Queen may, by order in council prohibit during the period specified by the order the catching of seals by British ships in such parts of the seas to which this act applies as are specified by the order.\n\"(2). While an order in council under this Act is in force.\n\"(a). A person belonging to a British ship shall not kill, take or hunt, or attempt to kill or take, any seal during the period and within the seas specified by the order.\n\"(6). If during the period and within the seas specified by the order, a British ship is found having on board thereof fishing or shooting implements or seal-skins or bodies of seals, it shall lie on the owner or master of such ship to prove that the ship was not used or employed in contravention of this act.\n\"Subsection 3. (1). A statement in writing, purporting to be signed by an officer having power in pursuance of this act to stop and examine a ship, as to the circumstances under which, or grounds on which, he stopped and examined the ship, shall be admissible in any proceedings, civil or criminal, as evidence of the facts or matters therein stated.\"\nThe clauses of the said Imperial Order in Council bearing upon this case are as follows:\n\"1. From and after the fourth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-three, until the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-four, the catching of seals by British ships is hereby prohibited within such parts of the seas to which the recited act applies, as are comprised within the following zones, that is to say (1) a zone of ten marine miles on all the Russian coasts of Behring Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, and (2) a zone of thirty marine miles round the Komandorsky Islands and Tul\u00e9new (Robben Islands).\"\n\"2. The powers which under the recited act may be exercised by any commissioned officer on full pay in the Naval Service of Her Majesty, may be exercised by the captain or other officer in command of any war vessel of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia in relation to a British ship, and the equipment and crew and certificate thereof.\"\nThe following is a copy of the protocol signed by the captain:\n\"Protocol of the examination of the schooner \"Minnie.\"\n\"On this 17th day of July in the year 1893, in latitude 54\u00b0 21' N., and longitude 168\u00b0 38' E. at a distance of twenty-two miles from the southern extremity of Copper Island, a schooner under sail was seen at 9 o'clock in the evening by His Imperial Majesty's Transport \"Yacout,\" cruising off the Commander Islands.\n\"On nearing her she was ordered by the transport to bring to, which was promptly done. A whale boat at once put off from the schooner to the transport with the mate, who explained that the schooner was English, (that she was) from Victoria (that) her name was \"Minnie.\" For six days he had taken no observations.\"\n\"The Midshipman, Michaelof Raslovlef, was sent for the examination of the aforesaid schooner, who on his return to the transport with the schooner's skipper, Julius Mohrhouse, brought with him the log-book and ship's papers and reported (that) they had on the schooner 12 whale-boats, 23 shot-guns and one rifle, and in the hold only a few seal-skins and salt. \"After an inspection of the aforesaid log-book and papers, the ship's Commission, appointed by order of the commander of the transport, on the 5th July, in accordance with N.42 consisting of the President, Lieutenant Ginter, and of the members Lieutenant Dedenef and Midshipman Michaelof Raslovlef, found that the schooner \"Minnie,\" (sailing) under the flag of Great Britain, belonging to Victor Jacobson, (and) under the command of Julius Mohrhouse, from Victoria, is sailing for the purpose of sealing by the way (i. e. is engaged in pelagic sealing) and called before her arrest by the transport, at San Juan, Yakoutat, and Sand Point, from which last port she sent the seal-skins she had procured to Victoria.\n\"The crew on the schooner consisted of 25 men. In accordance with the finding of the whole of the aforesaid commission, in compliance with the principle, s.s. 9 of the instructions to a war cruiser in the year 1893, for the protection of the Russian maritime industries in the Behring Sea, it was decided that after having seized the ship's documents, a temporary certificate be given to skipper Julius Mohrhouse, with an inscription upon it of the number and description of the documents seized, and that he be ordered to leave the territorial waters at once and go to Yokohama and there present himself to H. B. M.'s Consul and inform him that the documents of the schooner \"Minnie\" would be forwarded to the authorities of Great Britain.\n(Members signed).\n\"Midshipman MICHAELOF RASLOVLEF.\n\"Lieutenant DEDENEF.\n(Sgd.) \"President, Lieutenant GINTER.\n\"I confirm this document.\n(Sgd.) \"Captain (2 Rapa) SCHMELEVSKY.\"\nBelyea for the appellant.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral) We all think that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe first question is: Was the order in council sufficiently proved? I think that the judge was bound to take judicial notice of this order in council issued under the authority of the act of the Imperial Parliament from which the court derived its jurisdiction. The objection that the protocol was improperly admitted as evidence also fails. There can be no doubt that the \"Yacout\" was a \"war vessel\" though not a regular man-of-war. She was a cruiser employed in the service of the Emperor of Russia to prevent the catching of seals within the prohibited zone of the Komandorsky Islands, was in command of a commissioned officer of the Russian Navy, and officered and manned by a crew in the pay of the Russian Government and therefore pro hac vice was a \"war vessel\" of the Emperor of Russia within the meaning of that term as used in the order in council. The document was therefore clearly admissible in evidence under the statute as a statement in writing purporting to be signed by an officer having power under the act to stop and examine the ship as to the circumstances under which he actually did stop and examine her, and is proof of its contents, and that the officer who signed it was, as he purports to have been, the officer in command of the \"Yacout\" at the time of the seizure.\nThere still remains the question as to whether the \"Minnie\" having been seized in prohibited waters fulfils the onus cast upon her by the statute. I do not think she does. She must prove that, being fully equipped and manned for sealing, she was not \"used or employed in killing or attempting to kill any seal within the seas specified in the Imperial Order in Council.\" The only evidence adduced for this purpose is the evidence of Captain Mohrhouse. If we were to say that we gave full credit to this witness we should be overruling the learned judge in whose presence he was examined, and who had the opportunity of observing his demeanour whilst under examination and had therefore means of judging of his credibility which no Court of Appeal can have. The learned judge says most distinctly that he did not believe Captain Mohrhouse, when he stated that he was in the locality where the \"Minnie\" was seized by accident, and that must be conclusive. From the documents and from the circumstances in evidence, I am of opinion that not only was not the statutory presumption displaced but it was proved that the \"Minnie\" was a sealing vessel, fully equipped and manned and in pursuit of seals and was sailing in the neighbourhood of the islands for no other purpose except to catch seals.\nIn giving effect to the statute we are only called upon to find whether or not the vessel, having been taken in prohibited waters, has proved that she was there for a lawful purpose. The learned judge who heard the evidence says she was not, and the evidence of Captain Mohrhouse being discarded for the reason above given that conclusion is inevitable.\nThe presumption of the liability of the \"Minnie\" as declared by the statute has not been rebutted and for this reason alone we could not reverse the finding of the learned judge; but, I repeat, even if the onus was upon the crown, the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove that the \"Minnie\" was guilty of an infraction of the statute and order in council.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Arthur Louis Belyea.\nSolicitor for respondent: Chs. E. Pooley.\n[1] 4 Ex. C. R. 151.\n"}

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, and King JJ.\nOn Appeal from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nPleadings\u2014Sufficient traverse of allegation by plaintiff\u2014Objection first taken on appeal.\nThe plaintiff by his statement of claim alleged a partnership between two defendants, one being married whose name on a re-arrangement of the partnership was substituted for that of her husband without her knowledge or authority.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below that a denial by the married woman that \"on the date alleged or at any other time she entered into partnership with the other defendant\" was a sufficient traverse of plaintiff's allegation to put the party to proof of that fact.\nHeld also, that an objection to the insufficiency of the traverse would not be entertained when taken for the first time on appeal, the issue having been tried on the assumption that the traverse was sufficient.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, whereby the judgment pronounced by the trial judge against the appellant for the sum of $12,043.25 was affirmed, the amount, however, to be reduced to $5,270.00.\nThe respondent brought an action against the defendant, A. J. Jackson, her son, and the appellant to recover money lent and advanced to them as trading partners.\nOn the 22nd day of April, 1891, the defendant A. J. Jackson, by deed entered into a trading partnership with P. E. Mylius (the appellant's husband) for the term of five years. Shortly afterwards, a re-arrange- ment of the partnership affairs was apparently attempted by the substitution of the appellant's name in place of her husband's in the partnership but without her knowledge or authority.\nAt the time of the alleged contract the appellant had no separate property. The appellant by her statement of defence denied \" that on the 22nd of April, 1891, or at any other time she entered into partnership with the defendant, A. J. Jackson, as alleged in paragraph two of the statement of claim.\"\nThe action came on for trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Crease, without a jury, at the city of Victoria, when judgment was delivered in favour of the plaintiff, judgment having been previously signed against the defendant, A. J. Jackson, in default of appearance.\nThe present appellant then appealed to the full court and they reduced the amount of judgment to $5,270.\nThe decision of the full court was based upon the ground that the appellant had admitted the partnership in her pleadings and that as there was no evidence to the contrary, effect must now be given to that admission.\nBelyea for appellant.\nChrysler Q.C for respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral.) I think the appeal should be allowed upon the ground that the alleged partnership has not been proved.\nAt the trial it was assumed by the learned judge and by the counsel on both sides that the partnership alleged by the statement of claim was sufficiently denied by the defence. The traverse in the statement of defence is in these words: The defendant denies that on the 22nd of April, 1891, or at any other time she entered into partnership with the defendant A. J. Jackson, as alleged in paragraph two of the statement of claim.\nThe words \"or at any other time \"ought to be sufficient to save the pleading from the objection of \" negative pregnant \" even if taken at the earliest possible moment. But I think it would be monstrous that such an objection should prevail after a trial at which the parties and the judge all took it for granted that the partnership was sufficiently denied, when taken for the first time after judgment in appeal, and then not urged by the plaintiff but emanating from the court who held that the partnership, notwithstanding all that had taken place at the trial, was admitted on the pleadings.\nI am of opinion therefore that the case is one in which the traverse of the allegation of a partnership was sufficient to put the plaintiff to the proof of that fact. Then, the proof in that respect wholly fails; there is no evidence that Mrs. Mylius ever entered into partnership with Jackson. Her husband may have agreed that she should be a partner but that cannot possibly bind her, and therefore, altogether aside from the question whether the appellant had separate property at the time of the alleged partnership, and upon the simple ground that a partnership has not been proved, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment below reversed, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : A.

The application was granted on the condition that the applicant would pay certain ground-rents and bonuses and make surveys and build a mill. The claimant knew of the dispute which was at the time open and public. He paid the rents and bonuses, made the surveys and enlarged a mill he had previously built, which was accepted as equivalent to building a new one. The dispute was determined adversely to the Government of Canada at the time six leases or licenses were current, and consequently the Government could not renew them. The leases were granted under sections 49 and 50 of 46 Vic. ch. 17, and the regulations made under the act of 1879 provided that \"the license may be renewed for another year subject to such revision of the annual rental and royalty to be paid therefor as may be fixed by the Governor in Council.\"\nIn a claim for damages by the licensee.\nHeld, 1. Orders in Council issued pursuant to 46 Vic. ch. 17, secs. 49 and 50 authorizing the Minister of the Interior to grant licenses to cut timber did not constitute contracts between the crown and proposed licensees, such orders in council being revocable by the crown until acted upon by the granting of licenses under them.\n2. The right of renewal of the licenses was optional with the crown and the claimant was entitled to recover from the Government only the moneys paid to them for ground rents and bonuses. The licenses which were granted and were actually current in 1884 and 1885 conferred upon the licensee \"full right, power and license to take and keep exclusive possession of the said lands except as thereinafter mentioned for and during the period of one year from the 31st of December 1883 to the 31st December 1884, and no longer.''\nQu\u0153re. Though this was in law a lease for one year of the lands comprised in the license, was the crown bound by any implied covenant to be read into the license for good right and title to make the lease and for quiet enjoyment?\nA cross appeal will be disregarded by the court when rules 62 and 63 of the Supreme Court Rules have not been complied with.\nAPPEAL and CROSS APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court[1] on a claim for damages for the breach of several agreements by which damages to the extent of $5,070.00 were awarded to the appellant.\nThe facts and pleadings and licenses and regulations in question issued under the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, as well as the material sections of the act are fully given in the report of the case in the Exchequer Court. (1)\nNo notice of any cross appeal was given on behalf of the respondent until the 7th of October, 1893, when respondent's solicitors gave notice of the intention of the respondent on the hearing of the appeal to contend by way of cross appeal that the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside in so far as it awards to the appellant $5,070.18. The time for depositing security by the appellant expired on 15th March, 1893, and security for the appeal was deposited and notice of hearing for the May sittings given on that day. The appeal was inscribed for hearing on the 27th March, 1893. The appeal was adjourned by consent until the October term 1893. Notice of hearing for the October term was given on 16th September last. In addition to the cases cited and relied on by counsel in the court below and in the judgment of the Exchequer Court[2]. McCarthy Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. for the appellant cited Cooper v. Phibbs[3]; Rolph v. Crouch[4]; Foster v. Wheeler[5]; Godwin v. Francis[6]; Jenkins y. Jones[7]; Bunny v. Hopkinson[8]; Wetter v. Moore[9]; Sikes v. Wild[10]; Eichholz v. Bannister[11]; Raphael v.

The Queen[19]; Beaumont v. Cramp[20]; Kissock v. Jarvis[21].\nRobinson Q.C., and Hogg Q.C. for the respondent cited and relied on Aspdin v. Austin[22]; Dunn v.\nSayles[23]; Ellis v. Grubb[24]; Ferguson v. Hill[25];\nCrosby v. Wadsworth[26]; Carrington v. Roots[27]; Scorell v. Boxall[28]; Petch v. Tutin[29].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court, by which damages to the extent of $5,070 were awarded to the appellant, who now by this appeal seeks to have that amount largely increased.\nThe crown has also instituted a cross appeal insisting that the appellant was not entitled to recover any damages. The cross appeal, however, is not regularly before the court, the notice required by general orders 62 and 63 not having been given in due time, and we must therefore disregard it, and confine our decision to the principal appeal exclusively.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the judgment of the Exchequer Court which is reported in the 3rd volume of the Exchequer Reports (p. 184) and to the statement I refer.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed and that upon the ground that the claimant, if entitled to recover any damages, was certainly not entitled to recover more than the judgment he appeals against has given him. The orders in council authorizing the Minister of the Interior to grant the licenses to cut timber on the timber berths in question did not, on any principle which has been established by authority, or which I can discover, constitute contracts between the crown and the proposed licensees. These orders in council, as similar administrative orders in the case of sales of crown lands in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec have always been held to be, were revocable by the crown until acted upon by the granting of licenses under them. They embodied no agreement of which specific performance could be enforced. They were mere authorities by the Governor in Council to the minister upon which the latter was not bound to act, but might act in his discretion. This is apparent from the statutory enactment applicable to these orders in council and the licenses to be issued under them. I refer to sections 49 and 50 of 46 Vict. cap. 17. The Dominion Lands Act of 1883 section 49 is as follows:\u2014\nThe Governor in Council may, from time to time, order that leases of the right to cut timber on certain timber berths denned in the order shall be offered at public auction at an upset bonus fixed by the order and given to the person bidding in each case the highest bonus therefor, such bonus to be paid in cash at the time of sale. The Governor in Council may also authorize the lease of the right to cut timber on any timber berth to any person who is the sole applicant for it; the bonus to be paid by such applicant to be fixed in the order authorizing the lease to him, and to be paid in cash at the time of its issue.\nNone of the ten timber berths in respect of which this claim is made were put up to sale by auction, but were granted under the latter part of the section, or under subsection 2 which it is not material to set out. I am at a loss to conceive any language better adapted to indicate that the order of the Governor General in Council was a mere authority which might or might not be acted upon by the minister, and which the Governor General in Council might at any time recall before it was executed by a lease or license, than that in which these clauses are expressed. Upon this ground I must hold that there was no breach of contract in respect of the four berths or limits for which orders in council were issued but for which no leases or licenses were issued. It must, therefore, depend upon the construction and effect of the leases themselves whether there has been any breach of contract.\nUpon this head it is contended in the first place that there was a binding legal obligation upon the crown to renew these leases from year to year and that there was a breach of this obligation in refusing to renew for the year 1886 the six leases or licenses which had been granted for the year 1885. I am of opinion that the appellant also fails to make good this proposition. The leases were granted under section 50 of the act of 1883, which is in the following words:\u2014\nLeases of timber berths shall be for a term not exceeding one year, and the lessee of a timber berth shall not be held to have any claim whatever to a renewal of his lease unless such renewal is provided for in the order in council authorizing it, or embodied in the conditions of sale or tender as the case may be under which it was obtained.\nThere were no conditions of sale referring to any of these leases. The timber berths for which they were granted were not in any case put up to sale by auction. It does not appear that any tender embodying any proposals for a renewal was ever made by the appellant or those through whom he claims title.\nNo provision relating to renewal is to be found in the leases. These instruments on their faces state that they are issued under the authority of the act of 1883 and of the order of the Governor General in Council. The order in council recommends that the license be granted under the conditions of the regulations approved by order in council of the 8th March, 1883.\nAlthough these regulations were actually not made under the act of 1883, but under the former act of 1879, they may be assumed to have been re-adopted by the Governor General in Council for the purposes of the later act. The only regulation which has any reference to renewal is the third, which provides that:\u2014\nWhen a licensee has fully complied with all the above conditions, and when no portion of the timber berth is required for settlement or other public purpose of which the Minister of the Interior is to be the judge, the license may be renewed for another year subject to such revision of the annual rental and royalty to be paid therefor as may be fixed by the Governor in Council.\nThen, assuming this provision to be incorporated in the order in council and therefore by force of the statute to apply to the leases in question, I see nothing in it making it obligatory on the crown to grant renewals. I construe the 50th clause of the act as meaning that renewals are to be governed by the terms of the orders in council authorizing leases. Then reading this regulation as though it had been embodied in the orders in council in pursuance of which these leases were granted, it confers no absolute right of renewal. It is in terms as clearly facultative and permissive as language could make it. The license it says \"may\" be renewed, provided the Minister of the Interior shall be satisfied the conditions have been complied with, and in the absence of certain other contingencies but upon such terms as to \"annual rental and royalty to be paid therefor as may be fixed by the Governor General in Council.\" This, therefore, if we are to construe words according to their obvious meaning and not to wrest them from their natural signification in order to reach a construction unfavourable to the crown, means that the right of renewal is to be optional with the crown; to depend on the judgment of the Minister of the Interior in the first place; and the renewal, if there is to be one, is to be on such terms as the Governor General in Council prescribes and therefore necessarily in the discretion of the latter authority. Manifestly the object of this regulation is administrative and departmental only, intended as a guide and authority to the minister and departmental officers, and not for the purpose of creating any obligation on the part of the crown towards the licensee. This disposes of the appellant's claim to a breach of contract in respect of refusals to renew.\nNext we have the claim that there was a constructive eviction and failure of title which constituted a breach of certain covenants or stipulations which, though not expressed, are by law to be implied in the licenses which were granted and were actually current in 1884 and 1885. This contention is founded upon the clause in the license by which the Minister of the Interior confers upon the licensee \"full right, power and license to take and keep exclusive possession of the said lands except as thereinafter mentioned for and during the period of one year from the 31st of December, 1883, to the 31st December, 1884, and no longer.\" This it is said, and no doubt correctly, is in law a lease for one year of the lands comprised in the license. From this it is argued that it follows that the same covenants for good right and title to make the lease and for quiet enjoyment are to be implied as in the case of an ordinary lease of land between subjects in which the operative word \"demise\" or its equivalent is used. This I at least doubt. No authority either way has been produced by the learned counsel who appeared for the appellant and addressed to the court an argument which indicated very careful preparation; nor have I after a very careful search been able to find any, upon the question whether the same implication of covenants is to be made in a lease by the crown as in that between subjects. In Robertson v. The Queen[30] I expressed the opinion that no covenant was implied in the fishery license in that case; that, however, was not a lease of land but a mere grant or license for a right of several fishery, and in the case of a grant of such a right no authority can be found for inferring a covenant. There is indeed a dictum of no less authority than Tindal C. J. the other way[31], who says that such an implication only arises in connection with a lease of land, and it has been decided that in a lease of personal property there is no such implication. In Bacon's abridgement, covenant B., it is said:\nBut if a man leases certain goods for years by indenture which are evicted within the term yet he shall not have a writ of covenant for the law does not create any covenant upon such personal thing. That, however, would not be conclusive here, for undoubtedly this license does contain a lease of the land for a year, though such a lease is of course merely subordinate and incidental to the principal object which the crown and the licensee both had in view, the cutting down and acquisition of the timber. It is, however, well established that all crown grants are to be construed most favourably for the crown, and this doctrine has been adopted in the United States where the same rule of construction is applied in favour of the government to exclude implications of terms not expressed and not involved as a necessary consequence of the words actually used. I refer on this point to the case of the Mayor of Alleghany v. The Ohio & Pennsylvania Railroad Co.[32], where it is said, referring to a grant by the commonwealth:\nNothing is to be taken by implication against the public except what necessarily flows from the nature and terms of the grant.\nThe tendency of modern decisions, moreover, is against the implication of provisions in a deed. I find that in a case decided after Hart v. Windsor[33], that of Messent v. Reynolds[34], Oreswell J. expresses the opinion that these covenants are only to be implied in a lease when the word \"demise\" is used, but Hart v. Windsor (2), was not cited, and I must concede that the latter authorities, especially Mostyn v. West Mostyn Coal Company[35] are the other way. On the whole if I were compelled to decide this question of law, I should be inclined to hold that the crown was not bound by any implied covenant to be read into these licenses. It is, however, really not necessary to come to any conclusive opinion upon this point. By not presenting its cross appeal in due time the crown has lost the right to attack the judgment of the Exchequer. That judgment must therefore stand for the amount awarded by it to the claimant, and restricting his right to recover damages to the licenses actually existing and in force at the time of the constructive eviction, he would not be entitled to recover more than he actually paid for rentals and bonuses for that current year or for the years 1884 and 1885, an amount which would fall far short of that for which judgment has been rendered. As regards the measure of damages the authorities cited by the learned judge of the Court of Exchequer in his very able judgment demonstrate conclusively that this claimant, who applied for and took his licenses with his eyes open as regard the notorious uncertainty of the title which the Dominion Government claimed, could not recover more than the amount he had actually paid the crown.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed, and the cross appeal also; the latter with costs.\nThe case is one of some hardship and for that reason I am disposed to give no costs to the crown, who, in my judgment ought not to have granted the licenses in question.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Sedge-wick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPetition of Right\u201446 Vic. c. 27 (P.Q.)\u2014Contract\u2014Final certificate of enqineer\u2014Extras Practice as to plea in bar not set up.\nA contract entered into between Her Majesty the Queen in right of the province of Quebec and S. X. Cimon, for the construction of three of the departmental buildings at Quebec contained the usual clauses that the balance of the contract price was not payable untol a final certificate by the engineer in charge was delivered, showing the total amount of work done, and materials furnished and the cost of extras and the reduction in the contract Drice upon any alterations. There was a clause providing for the final decision by the Commissioner of Public Works in matters in dispute upon the taking over or rattling for the works. The Commissioner of Public Works, after hearing the parties, gave his decision that nothing was due to the contractors, and the engineer in charge, by his final certificate, declared that a balance of $31 .36 was due upon the contract price and $42.84 on extras.\nThe suppliants by their petition of right claimed inter alia $70,000 due on extras. The crown pleaded general denial and payment.\nThe Superior Court granted the suppliants $74.20, the amount declared to be due under the final certificate of the engineer On appealI the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Anneal side) increased the amount to $13198.77 interest and costs.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court that the suppliants were bound by the final certificate given by the engineer under the terms of the contract\nPer Fournier and Taschereau JJ. Dissenting that as the final certificate had not been set up in the pleadings as a bar to the action and there was an admission of record by the crown that the contractor was entitled to 20 per cent commission on extras ordered and received, the evidence fully justified the finding of the Court of Queen's Bench that the commission of 20 per cent was still due and unpaid on $65,837.09 of said extra work.\nAPPEAL and CROSS APPEAL from a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench fir Lower Canada, adjudging the respondents to be entitled to $13198.77 with interest from the 1st May, 1884.\nThe proceedings originated by a petition of right (46 Vic. c. 27, P.Q.), filed by the respondents, the heirs of the late Simon X. Cimon, claiming from the Government of the province of Quebec, the sum of $76,170, and interest.\nThe respondents are the heirs and successors in title of the firm of Piton & Cimon contractors for the departmental buildings, at Quebec.\nThe respondents clam payment by their petition of right '. the balance of the contract price amounting to $8,000 and $l,010 for interest paid upon letters of credit given by the Government in lieu of cash, to which the contractors were, according to their contention, entitled under the contract.\n$40,000 amount paid to the workmen in additional wages at an increase of 20 cents per diem after a strike and a riot, upon the alleged express undertaking by the Government to repay such amount.\n$70,000 balance of price of extras and amount payable as compensation for the labour and responsibility of the contractors, being (20) per cent, profit upon the cost of such extras, which amounted to a sum exceeding $150,000.\n$25,000 damages suffered by reason of the Government having signified a protest to the contractors annulling the contract.\nThe crown met this demand by a plea of payment and the general issue. There was also an incidental demand for $50,000. Some witnesses were examined, and. an immense mass of accounts, reports and papers of all kinds were put into the record.\nThe defendant, towards the closing of the filed a final report of Mr. Gauvreau the engineer in charge of the works about the main contract. An objection was taken to the filing of that document, and the objection was reserved.\nThe Superior Court adopting the final certificate given by the architect under the terms of the contract adjudged the suppliant to be entitled to the amount shown by such certificate as to balance of contract price, viz.: $31.36 and the amount thereon by this certificate to be due for extras\u2014$42.84, making a total of $174.20 for which judgment was given.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) the case was decided upon the claim for 20 per cent, commission upon the cost of the extras, and after discussion of accounts.\nStuart Q.C., for appellant and respondent on cross-appeal;\nAs a preliminary question we contend that the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench was too late and that the judgment of the Superior Court had become final and conclusive by lapse of time. The final certificate of the engineer in charge is dated August, 1882, and establishes a balance in their favour of $31.36 upon the contract price and a balance upon the extra work of $42.84. This certificate was the basis of the judgment of the Superior Court and we are at a loss to understand why the Court of Queen's Bench disregarded it. That this certificate is conclusive upon the points in dispute appears to us to be an almost incontrovertible proposition. The petition of right does not in any way attack the engineer, nor impute to him incompetency, error or fraud; it simply overlooks the certificate, overlooking at the same time that the certificate was a condition precedent to the right of action, and that the parties were bound by its terms unless it were set aside by the courts for a lawful reason.\nThis point has been so often decided by this court that it is almost futile to airain recite the authorities: Peters v. The (Quebec Harbour Comissioners ([1]) Jones v. The Queen ([2]); Goodyear v. The Mayor of Weymouth ([3]); Sharpe v. The San Paulo Railway Co. ([4]); O'Brien v. Tue Queen ([5]); Guilbault v. McGreevy ([6]).\nThe contract further provided by the 8th clause that in the events of dispute upon the taking over or settling for the works, etc., the commissioner should alone decide all matters in dispute. The whole matter which forms the subject of the present cause having been referred to the commissioner he on the 10th January, 1885, wrote to the late S. S. Cimon, communicating his decision and that of the Executive Council of the province, and refusing to entertain any of Mr. Cimon's claims.\nWe submit that we have in the final certificate and in the decision of the Commissioner of Public Works the answers contemplated by the contract to the suppliants' claim This also applies to the cross appeal.\nNow as to the merits of the claim for the commission alleged not to have been paid. \u00c2. reference to the accounts for labour, at pages 349 and following, will show the court that the contractors were charging not the real cost of the work, the actual wages paid and the true cost price of the material, but were supplying accounts in which they charged a large profit upon their outlay, amounting, according to the recorded opinion of the engineer to 100 or 200 per cent. Yet the court is now asked to give to the representatives of these same people 20 per cent additional upon the face value of these already exaggerated accounts.\nAwiyot Q. C. for respondent, and appellant on cross appeal .\nThe following admission by the crown at page 39 of the case viz.: That the amount of the extra works given by Mr. Lesage in his evidence represents the costs of the same, and cost price (valeur brute) as accepted and reduced by Her Majesty, the defendant, viz.: $74,015,655,conclusively proves that the extras were made for and accepted by the Government, and the only question which remains is: What was the remuneration or price to which the suppliants are entitled on these extras s Upon this I rely also upon the admission of record, page 38 \" The parties in this cause admit that the price agreed to between Her Majesty and the said Piton & Camion for the execution of the extra works not included in the contract was to be twenty Per cent over and above the value of those works, making, materials and cost, which twenty per cent the government had promised to pay them so as to indemnify them for their time, work and responsibility.\"\nThis with the calculation made by the appeal court which has relied on Mr. Lesage's evidence and on the vouchers of the crown should settle the point and put an end to the litigation unless the defendant wants this Honourable Court of Appeal and Error to act as a jury, accountant and tribunal of first instance.\nThe only ground of defence is that the final report of the engineer in charge which was put in at the end of trial settles the case I submit that the crown should have pleaded the same specially so as to allow the suppliants to controvert. How could we allege and prove fraud or gross injustice when that was not referred to in the written pleadings? Moreover it is not a final report; even Mr. Lesage admits this in his evidence when he says:\u2014\nThere is no final settlement between the contractors and. the Gov-eminent. The Department, it is true, has prepared a statement of what it pretended to be the accounts between the parties but the contractors have never assented, to it as the balance accruing to them, and the account is still there (est encore la).\nThe cases relied on by the appellant have no application to this part of the case as there is a special admission by the crown that a fixed sum was to be paid and the evidence clearly shows that the engineer did not include it in his report or even had anything to do with it.\nAs to the preliminary objection relied on by appellant in this appeal it was not taken in the Court of Queen's Bench and it is too late now. Sirez. Table Gen. Vo. appel, nos. 149-154. On the cross appeal we contend that the contract specially provides that we are not bound by the certificate of the engineer but by the decision of the commissioner alone \" and therefore, I contend that the contract as admitted, must be held to have been completely executed, and there being no special plea in bar the crown is not entitled to any reduction.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and judgment of Superior Court restored with costs to the crown.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Cette cause a commenc\u00e9 par une petition de droit adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui a \u00e9tendu la juridiction de cette Cour \u00e0 ces mati\u00e8res.\nLe gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec avait fait un contrat en forme authentique avec Piton et Cimon, pour la construction de trois des quatre b\u00e2tisses d\u00e9partementales, dans la cite de Qu\u00e9bec. Le contrat contient des conditions pourvoyant au cas d'ouvrages extras. Le prix total \u00e9tait de $325000. Piton et Cimon ex\u00e9cut\u00e8rent leur contrat; pendant la construction des ouvrages, Piton transporta \u00e0 Cimon ses int\u00e9r\u00eats dans le contrat.\nApr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, en 1885, Cimon fit application pour une petition de droit r\u00e9clamant la balance qui lui \u00e9tait due. Ii mourut avant d'avoir obtenu le fiat, et sa veuve comme l\u00e9gataire univesselle, renouvela la demande d'une petition de droit elle mourut aussi, avant d'avoir obtenu la permission de proc\u00e9der. Enfin ses h\u00e9ritiers pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent la petition en cette cause qui fut allou\u00e9e par le Lieut.-Grouvemeur le 28 Janvier 1888.\nLes qualit\u00e9s des parties sont admises.\nLa gouvernement plaida paiement et une d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait.\nLes diff\u00e9rents items de la demande sont au nombre de cinq, mais la Cour du Banc de la Reine, ayant rejet\u00e9 tous les items, \u00e0 l'exception du m\u00eame, le pr\u00e9sent appel repose enti\u00e8rement sur cet item; il est tout \u00e0 fait inutile de s'occuper des autres. il s'agit dans cet item de la commission de 20 p.c. r\u00e9clam\u00e9e sur les travaux extras.\nLa premiere chose \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est de savoir s'il v a preuve que des ouvrages extras ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, et qu'une commission de 20 p. c. sur ces ouvrages devait Ctre accord\u00e9e au contracteur. M. Lesage, d\u00e9pute ministre des Travaux Publics, dit que tous les ouvrages extras dont il parle dans son t\u00e9moignage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ordonn\u00e9s par le commissaire des Travaux Publics ou faits sous sa responsabilit\u00e9. il ajoute que dans tous les cas le D\u00e9partement admet que tous les ouvrages extras ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ordonn\u00e9s, faits et accept\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s rectification d'une erreur qu'il avait commise dans son premier t\u00e9moignage, dans lequel ii avait attribu\u00e9 au contracter, comme extras, des ouvrages faits par d'autres con tracteurs, en vertu de contrats sp\u00e9ciaux, apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9tude des faits par les officiers du D\u00e9partement, par M. Lesage, M. Berlinguet, architecte et expert, et comptable, ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re positive qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait des ouvrages extras pour la somme de $74,055.55. Ce fait est parfaitement prouv\u00e9 et la Cour du Banc de la Reine l'a admis comme la base de son jugement.\nLa preuve du montant de la commission est non moins positive et parfaite. A l'interrogatoire, m\u00eame, article des articulations de faits '.\nIs it not true that the defendant has promised to pay (20 p.c.) twenty per cent upon the cost and value of the said (extra) works to indemnify them as alleged in the action?\nLa Reine, par son procureur duement autoris\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu affirmativement. il y a en outre, \u00e0 la page 38 ler Vol. du dossier l'admission suivante:\nQue le prix convenu entre Sa Majest\u00e9 et les dits Piton et Cimon, pour Ia confection des ouvrages extras et autres, \u00e0 part du contrat, par eux faits, \u00e8tait \u00e0 part le co\u00fbt des mat\u00e9riaux et de la main-d'oeuvre de vingt par cent en sus de Ia valeur de ces ouvrages, main-d'\u0153uvre, mat\u00e9riaux et leur co\u00fbt, lesquels le gouvernement susdit avait promis leur payer pour les indemniser de leur temps, travail et responsabilit\u00e9.\nCette admission forme une preuve compl\u00e8te du montant de la commission. Elle est sign\u00e9e non pas seulement par le procureur de record, mais par \" Chs. Langelier d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9.\" La force probante de cette pi\u00e8ce n'aurait Pu \u00eatre an\u00e9antie que dans le cas ou le procureur qui l'a sign\u00e9, n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 a le faire. Mais ii y \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment autoris\u00e9 puisque la pi\u00e8ce le comporte et qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savou\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s le code de proc\u00e9dure, pour d\u00e9truire la preuve faith par cette admission, ii n'y avait d'autre moyen que celui du d\u00e9saveu; comme la d\u00e9fense n'y a pas eu recours, la preuve faite par cette admission conserve toute sa force legale. Aussi la Cour du Banc de la Reine l'a-t-elle admise et prise comme base de la commission qu'elle a accord\u00e9e (20 p.c.) vingt par cent sur les comptes d'ouvrages extras dans lesquels cette commission n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e. Ce n'\u00e9tait plus alors qu'une affaire de calcul pour en arriver au montant qu'elle a fix\u00e9 de $13,198.77, int\u00e9r\u00eat du ler mai 1884, et le montant n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l'hon. Juge Boss\u00e8 qu'apr\u00e8s une \u00e8tude sp\u00e9ciale des nombreuses pi\u00e8ces du dossier qu'il a compass\u00e9es \u00e0 cet effet. Je me suis aussi convaincu par l'examen des preuves, qu'il a fait une juste estimation du montant de la commission. Ce jugement sur la contestation telle que li\u00e9e entre les parties \u00e9tant correcte le litige aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre termin\u00e9 par cette d\u00e9cision. Mais les proc\u00e8s ne sont pas faits pour durer si peu, et \u00e0 mesure quills se prolongent, les parties d\u00e9couvrent de nouveaux moyens pour les faire durer davantage. C'est ce qui a lieu dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, o\u00f9 l'appelante invoque pour la premi\u00e8re fois des moyens qu'elle n'a ni plaid\u00e9 ni fait valoir en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, non plus qu'en appel devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine. C'est devant cette cour seulement que l'appelante oppose \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une fin de non recevoir fond\u00e9e sur cc que l'appelante n'a pas produit un certificat final de 'ing\u00e9nieur en charge des travaux, constatant que les dits ouvrages sont bien et duement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et certifi\u00e9s. Voil\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re objection soulev\u00e9e par l'appelante. La seconde est que l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour l'appel.\nL'appelante peut-elle \u00eatre admise \u00e0 faire valoir ces moyens pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant une cour d'appel, por ainsi dire de dernier ressort? En cour de premi\u00e8re instance il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement question de cc certificat qui aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9liminairement oppose comme fin de non recevoir \u00e0 l'action. Au lieu d'exigrer par une d\u00e9fense sp\u00e9ciale Ia production de cc certificat pour prouver l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, l'appelante a plaid\u00e9 paiement de tons les item de la demande, accompagn\u00e9, il est vrai d'une defence au fond en fait dont les effets sont limit\u00e8s par l'admission que comporte le plaidoyer de paiement. A la preuve en cour Sup\u00e9rieuee toute la contestation et les preuves se sont faites sur l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 la fin de l'enquete que la d\u00e9fense a produit, malgr\u00e9 l'opposition du demandeur, un pr\u00e9tendu certificat final de M. P. Grauvreau, l'archi-tecte en charge des travaux. C'\u00e9tait un fait special qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plaid\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminairement, afin de fournir an demandeur l'occasion soit de l'attaoqer soit de l'admettre. il a m\u00eame fait motion pour le faire rejeter hors du dossier, et bien que cette motion n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, elle se trouve l'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 de fait parce que les deux cours n'ont attach\u00e9 aucune importance \u00e0 ce certificat. Quelle valeur d'ailleurs pouvaient-elles donner \u00e0 un pr\u00e9tendu certificat final, fait en 1882, pour des ouvrages livr\u00e9s en 1884? Ce certificat est de plus contredit \"par l'admission de l'appelante \u00e0 la page 34, 1. 33, savoir que :\nSi aucun montant est d\u00fb aux p\u00e9titionnaires, ce n'est que depuis le premier mai 1884.\nM. Lesage, dans son t\u00e9moignage, ne pretend pas qu'il y a eu un certificat final. A la page 85, il dit:\u2014\nIl n'y a pas eu de r\u00e8glement final entre les contracteurs et le gouvernement. Le d\u00e9partemntt a bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un \u00e9tat de ce qu'il pr\u00e9tendait \u00e9tre les comptes entre les parties, ma'is les contracteurs n'ont jamais voulu l'accepter comme la balance qui leur revenait et le compte est encore l\u00e0.\nil est evident que c'est une admission qu'il n'y a pas eu de certificat final et que puisque les parties \u00e9taient en difficult\u00e9 sur le r\u00e8glement ce n'\u00e9tait pas la clause du contrat au sujet du certificat qui devait s'appliquer, mais la clause m\u00eame, qui dit:\u2014\nQue le commssaire aura seul le droit de d\u00e9cider au cas qu'il s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve quelque difficult\u00e9 entre les parties au sujet de la r\u00e9ception, ou du r\u00e8glement des travaux ou sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner au pr\u00e9sent march\u00e9, aux dits plans et devis; et que. les dits entrepreneurs se sont tenus de s'en rapporter \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du dit commissaire qui sera final et obligatoire pour toutes les parties.\nPuisque les parties ne pouvaient s'entendre, le seul moyen d'en finir \u00e9tait d'en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du commissaire; mais ii n'y a pas eu plus de d\u00e9cision du commissaire que de certificat final. Mais quoi qu'il en soit, ni l'un, ni l'autre de ces faits n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 plaide, l'appelante ne peut maintenant les invoquer et l'intim\u00e9 a droit d'opposer avec succ\u00e8s le d\u00e9faut de les avoir plaid\u00e9s ou d'avoir amender ses plaidoyers.\nL'appelante a cite dans son factum \u00e0 pen pr\u00e8s toutes les causes o\u00f9 ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le certificat final de li ing\u00e9nieur \u00e9tait indispensable au contracter, pour lui permettre de poursuivre le recouvrement de ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb; mais aucune de ces d\u00e9cisions ne s'applique \u00e0 la cause actuelle. En y r\u00e9f\u00e9rant, on voit que dans toutes ces causes l'absence d'un tel certificat a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en contestation dans le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure; tandis que dans celle-ci, ce d\u00e9faut de certificat n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement plaide. ii est evident par toute la proc\u00e9dure que ce n'\u00e9tait pas l'intention de l'appelante de s'en pr\u00e9valoir, puisque ce certificat n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit qu'\u00e0 la fin de l'enqu\u00eate; et d'ailleurs ce certificat ne couvre nullement la question de la commission de 20 p.c. qui a; \u00e9t\u00e9 omise et est rest\u00e9e pendante, attendant la d\u00e9cision du commissaire, pendant plus de deux ans. Mais ii est inutile de s'occuper davantage de ce certificat et d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail de toutes les erreurs et omissions qui s'y trouvent. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 dans son factum; il n'y a qu'une r\u00e9ponde p\u00e9remptoire \u00e0 faire, c'est qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaide, et que la cour ne doit pas s'en occuper.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me des objections soulev\u00e9es seulement devant cette cour est celle que l'appel n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le statut. L'appelante dit dans son factum '.\nThe fact that the right of appeal had been last by lapse of time does not seem to have been argued before the Court of Appeals.\nLe jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le 4 juin 1890, et l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris le 23 avril 1891, par cons\u00e9quent longtemps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9.\nEst-il encore temps d'opposer cette objection \u00e0 l'appelante? N'auaait-elle pas d\u00fb \u00eatre faite devant la cour du Banc de la Reine in limine? Toute la proc\u00e9dure a eu lieu sans qu'on y alt song\u00e8, et ce n'est que longtemps apr\u00e8s le jugement final Et devant cette cour que l'on a song\u00e9 \u00e0 en prendre avantage.\nD'apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9cisions de nos cours, les objections fond\u00e9es sur des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de proc\u00e9dure, lorsqu'elles n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9es ni invoqu\u00e9es au proc\u00e8s ne peuvent \u00eatre en appel. Bain v. The City of Montreal ([7]) au m\u00eame vol. p. 361, l'objection du d\u00e9faut de mise en cause d'une des parties doit \u00eatre prise in linmine; la m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la cause de L'Union de St. Joseph v. Lapievre ([8]) que le d\u00e9faut d'avis de poursuite n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9, ni oppose dans la cour inf\u00e9rieure, ne pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 en appel. D\u00e9cida aussi qu'un document produit au proc\u00e8s, mais invoqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant la cour du Banc de la Reine ne peut faire partie du dossier en appel devant cette cour ([9]). il est de principe dans le droit anglais, comme dans le droit fran\u00e7ais, que tes irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de proc\u00e9dures, dans le cours du proc\u00e8s sont couvertes par l'acquiescement r\u00e9sultant des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s subs\u00e9quents a moins qu'il n'en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris avantage avant de passer a d autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s. Dans la cause de Jones v. Van Patten ([10]) cit\u00e9e dans la note sur Graham and Waterman on New Trials ([11]) le juge Perkins d\u00e9clara que It is a well established rule that erroneous steps in the progress of a cause are waived, unless excepted to before additional steps are taken.\nDans le droit fran\u00e7ais les nuliit\u00e9s de proc\u00e9dure doivent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque de l'instance L'intim\u00e9 dans son factum a cite un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s sur cette question.

Dans cette cause l'appelante n'en a nullement pris avantage elle a conduit sa contestation absolument comme si l'appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris da;as les d\u00e9lais ordinaires. Cependant, elle va m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9tende que les juges doivent prononcer cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance d'ofiice, lors m\u00eame qu'elle n'est pas oppos\u00e9e. Mais l'autorit\u00e9 de Carr\u00e9 repousse cette doctrine; c'est, dit-il, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de celui qui a gagn\u00e9 son proc\u00e8s que cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance est prononc\u00e9e, c'est un fin de non-recevoir qu'il peut opposer comme la prescription ne l'ayant pas invoqu\u00e9e et la cour ayant juridiction; dans la mati\u00e8re du proc\u00e8s elle a Pu valablement proc\u00e9der \u00e0 jugement. il est certainement trop tard sur un deuxi\u00e8me appel pour en prendre avantage, et l'on doit ici faire appli cation du principe suivi par la cour de Cassation qui ne permet pas d'invoquer, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance d'appel devant cette cour. C'est en vain que 1 appelante invoque la chose jug\u00e9e pour maintenir sa pr\u00e9tention de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, car on a vu par les arr\u00eats de 1827 et 1834, cites plus haut, que la jurisprudence tend \u00e0 ne pas donner \u00e0 l'exception de la chose jug\u00e9e le caract\u00e8re d'une exception d'ordre public.\nPour les raisons ci -dessus donn\u00e9es les deux principales objections d\u00e9 l'appelante fond\u00e9es sur le d\u00e9faut de certificat, et la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'appel, doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9es, et le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe conte-appel de li intim\u00e9 dolt aussi \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J. -If this case was to be concluded by the rule that on a contract of this nature and under the conditions to be found therein, no action lies without the final certificate of the engineer, or other office named, except in cases of fraud or sometimes error, the appellant would have not much to fight against. The cases to that effect in this court itself are numerous. In England, a recent case of De Morgan and Rio de Janeiro Flour Mills \u00ec in re ([16]), supports that view which when applicable cannot, I take it, be controverter. But does the rule apply here or can it be given effect to? 1 think it does not apply, for the simple reason that the only amount granted to the respondents by the judgment appealed from is for the balance due them, not on the contract, nor any part thereof, hut on a subsequent promise made by the Government to them to pay them 20 p. c. over the extras. That promise is admitted in aspecial admission of fact, page 38. and by the answer to the Respondent's articulation of facts, page 501, I Is it \u00a1not true that the Government has promised to pay to the contractors 20 p. c. over the cost and value of the said works (extras) to indemnify them as alleged in the action?\" To which the defendant answers \"Yes.\" See also evidence, Ex. 5, No. 279 of plaintiff\u2019s that this promise was made on the 5th December, 1879. And the contention that this 20 p. c. is included in the engineer's certificate is in plain contradiction to the appellant's admission, page 39, that Lepage's, the crown's own officer's estimates cover only the actual cost of these extras, without this 20 p. c. St. Michel. their own witness (page 142) also proves the same thing. Now, I do not see how the engineer could include in his certificate anything of this 20 p. c. so-as to bind any one. And I do not see that he did; in. fact it is admitted that he did not.\nMr. Justice lBosse's careful review of the evidence on this point seems to me unanswerable. If he erred it. is against the respondents, not against the appellant.\nI also agree with my brother Fournier that it would be most unjust to allow the appellants in this court to rely upon the want of a final certificate, even if it was necessary or if it covered this 20 p. c, when they have not pleaded it. Had they pleaded it the respondents might have attacked it for fraud or error,, or have invoked waiver by the crown, or estoppel. The late case of Connecticut Fire Insurance Co v. Kavanagh in the Privy Council ([17]), is an authority against the appellant's' right to now avail themselves of a point of this nature which they have not put in issue on the-record. In this case by the admissions on record it is conceded that this 20 per cent ought to have been allowed by the engineer.\nThe other cases I may refer to on this point are Gray v. Richford ([18]); L Union St. Joseph v. Lapierre ([19]); Fuller v. Avies ([20]); Bain v. The City of Montreal ([21]) Oakes v. The City of Hakifax ([22]); Russell v. Lefrancois ([23]) and cases there cited Lash v. Meriden Britannia Co. ([24]); The Tasmania ([25]); Bank of Bengal v. Macleod ([26]); Scott v. The Phoenix Assurance Co. ([27]); Redfield v.

Jardine ([34]) Martin v. Mackonochee ([35]) Head v. Sanders ([36]); The Council of the Borough of Randwick v. The Australian &c. Coporation ([37]).\nThe judgment for interest from 1st May, 1884, is correct. There is an admission that any sum due was due from that date. This admission also renders the appellants' contention as to prescription unfounded. These admissions are by the Attorney-General for the crown, and bind the crown. I am surprised to see the contrary urged on behalf of the crown without a formal disavowal according to the Code of Procedure.\nAs to the cross-appeal, the majority of the court being of opinion that the crown's appeal should he allowed the cross-appall must stand dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred with THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Car\u00f3n Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitor for respondent : G.

The partnership having been dissolved A. assumed all the liabilities of the firm and continued to carry on the business alone. After the dissolution C. gave A. a discharge of the mortgage, but without receiving payment of his debt and afterwards brought an action against B. on the promissory note.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the note having been given for the mortgage debt C. could not recover without being prepared, upon payment, to convey to B. the mortgaged lands which he had incapacitated himself from doing.\nHeld, also, that by the terms of the dissolution of partnership the relations between A. and B. were changed to those of principal and surety, and it having been found at the trial that C. had notice of such change his release of the principal, A., discharged B., the surety, from liability for the debt.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts upon which the decision in this case was based may be briefly stated as follows:\nThe defendant, McDonald, carried on business in partnership with Adam Allison the plaintiff\u2019s brother, and the firm borrowed $1,000 from the plaintiff giving him a mortgage on partnership property and a joint and several promissory note as security. The partnership having been dissolved Adam Allison carried on the business alone, and agreed to pay the liabilities of the firm. The plaintiff after the dissolution gave Adam Allison a discharge of the mortgage given to secure his loan but was not paid, and Adam Allison mortgaged the lands again to raise funds. Eventually Adam Allison became insolvent and absconded and plaintiff endeavoured to recover the amount of his loan from defendant by action on the promissory note.\nAt the trial plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed but an appeal to the Divisional Court resulted in the judgment at the trial being reversed and judgment entered for plaintiff for the recovery of the amount of the note with interest from its maturity. On further appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Divisional Court and restored the judgment of the trial judge. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant. Unless the terms of dissolution of the partnership changed the relationship between the partners into that of a principal and surety the discharge of the mortgage would not affect plaintiff\u2019s remedy on the note. Swire v. Redman[3]; Birkett v. McGuire[4].\nIf there was such change of relationship unless plaintiff had knowledge of it he was under no duty to preserve securities or look after the interest of defendant specially. Oakeley v. Pasheller[5].\nRobinson for the respondent referred to Duncan, Fox & Co. v. North and South Wales Bank[6].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent Norman McDonald, and one Adam Allison, a brother of the appellant David Allison, were in 1888 in partnership as bankers, and in the course of their business borrowed $1,000 from the appellant who was also a banker. As, security for this loan Allison & McDonald gave the appellant their joint and several promissory note dated the 2nd March, 1888, payable two years after date, for $1,000 with interest at ten per cent. They also as further security for the loan gave the appellant a mortgage on certain lands in South Dorchester. The defeasance contained in this mortgage was in the following words:\nProvided this mortgage to be void on payment of the said sum of one thousand dollars according to the tenor of a promissory note made and bearing even date herewith made by the said mortgagors to the mortgagee for one thousand dollars and interest thereon as provided by the said note.\nIn February, 1889, Adam Allison and the respondent dissolved partnership. By the terms of the agreement for dissolution Adam Allison (who was to continue the business) undertook to pay all the liabilities of the partnership and the respondent relinquished all the assets to Adam Allison. On the 1st of July, 1889, the respondent conveyed his interest in the equity of redemption of the mortgaged property to Adam Allison. On the 19th May, 1891, the appellant gave up the security of the mortgage in favour of his brother and executed a statutory discharge which had the effect of vesting the equity of redemption in Adam Allison. Adam Allison subsequently mortgaged the property for a new loan to another lender. On the 16th July, 1891, Adam Allison, having become insolvent, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. On the 20th August, 1891, the appellant brought the present action to recover the amount of the promissory note from the respondent. The respondent set up in his defence that by releasing the mortgage the appellant had dis- charged him. The cause was originally heard before the Chancellor who dismissed the action. The learned Chancellor\u2019s judgment proceeded upon two distinct grounds: First, he held that the mortgage and promissory note having been given for the same debt, the appellant could not recover upon the note after having released the mortgage inasmuch as, apart altogether from any relation of principal and surety existing between Adam Allison and the respondent, the latter, on payment of the note, would have been entitled to a transfer of the mortgage which the appellant had, by discharging that security, put it out of his power to give him; secondly, the Chancellor\u2019s decision was put upon the independent ground that the dissolution agreement had changed the relationship of Adam Allison and the respondent inter se, and that from thenceforward it had become that of principal and surety in consequence of Adam Allison\u2019s undertaking to pay off the liabilities of the firm; that the appellant had notice of this alteration in the relationship of his debtors when he released the mortgage; and that consequently he, the respondent, was discharged.\nThe Queen\u2019s Bench Division on appeal dealt only with the latter point, and on the security of Swire v. Redman[7] held that both the respondent and Adam Allison having contracted with the appellant as principal debtors, and there having been no relation of suretyship actually existing between them at the time the promissory note and mortgage were given, the subsequent change in their relation to each other could not affect the appellant even though he had notice of it; and on this ground they reversed the Chancellor\u2019s judgment. The learned judges of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division do not seem to have had their attention directed to the first point; at all events they do not deal with it in the judgment of the court. The Court of Appeal have, by a majority of three to one, reversed the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench and restored the Chancellor\u2019s judgment, the dissenting judge being Mr. Justice Maclennan. The judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeds upon the point taken up in the first branch of the Chancellor\u2019s judgment, namely, that the appellant could not call upon the respondent to pay the mortgage debt without being prepared upon payment to re-convey to him the lands mortgaged to secure the debt which he had incapacitated himself from doing. Upon this point I entirely agree with the judgments of Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Osler delivered in the Court of Appeal.\nSo completely is the principle upon which they have decided the case supported by authority that it would, under the old system of procedure when law and equity were administered separately, have been of course to enjoin an action to recover on a promissory note brought under such circumstances as are disclosed by the evidence in this record. The rule is elementary and so well established that it is almost superfluous to quote authorities in support of it. The principle is the plain and just one that he who gives a pledge in security for a debt is upon payment, entitled to a return of that which he has given in security, from whence it follows that if the creditor is unable to return the pledge he will not be allowed to exact the debt. Palmer v. Hendrie[8]; Lockhart v. Hardy[9]; Walker v. Jones[10]. It has even been carried so far that in the case of Schoole v. Sall[11] Lord Redesdale restrained a mortgagee from suing at law upon his personal securities, not because he could not re-convey the mortgaged estate, but because he could not redeliver up all the title deeds which had been handed over to him, having lost them. Amongst the cases cited above those of Walker v. Jones[12] and Palmer v. Hendrie[13] are indistinguishable in principle from the present which they also closely resemble in their circumstances. Even if the mortgagee had obtained an absolute foreclosure by which he had made the mortgaged estate his own, and had then sold it for its fair value but for less than the mortgage debt, he could not sue the mortgagor on his bond, covenant, note or other collateral personal security for the unsatisfied residue, and that for the same reason, that he could not give him back the estate. In Coote on mortgages[14] the law is stated very clearly and concisely as follows:\nOrdinarily speaking a mortgagee can avail himself of all his collateral securities, but he cannot transfer the mortgage and retain the collateral securities or sever them from the mortgage: and where he assigned the latter and retained the former he was restrained from proceeding on the collateral security pending a suit for redemption. So he cannot proceed on his collateral securities if he has sold the estate, though fairly, for less than was due; and if he join with the purchaser of the equity of redemption in a sale and permit him to receive the purchase money the mortgagee, not being able to re-convey the estate, will not be allowed to sue the mortgagor for the amount so permitted to be received. He is also restrained from proceeding on his collateral securities if, having put the title deeds out of his power, he is unable to convey the estate effectually.\nIn Fisher on Mortgages[15] the law is summarized in the same way.\nIt is out of the question to say that the conveyance of the equity of redemption by the respondent to Adam Allison made any difference or entitled the appellant to release the mortgage in the way he did thus disregarding the equitable right of the respondent to have a re-conveyance of the mort- gaged estate if compelled to pay the debt. Notice of the conveyance by the respondent to Adam Allison ought, as Mr. Justice Osler points out, if it had had any effect, to have made the appellant more cautious in his dealings with the estate, for, if any inference was to be drawn from it, that inference ought to have been that Adam Allison having obtained that conveyance had in law, apart from the actual agreement, on the dissolution become bound to indemnify the respondent against the mortgage debt, inasmuch as the purchaser of an equity of redemption prim\u00e2 facie comes under that obligation to the mortgagor. If the agreement on the dissolution had been, not only that Adam Allison was to have the equity of redemption, but further that the respondent was to pay the mortgage debt, and the appellant had had notice of such an arrangement between the partners, then, but not otherwise, he would have been justified in releasing the mortgage so as to vest the legal estate in his brother. It was not essential that the respondent should prove that the appellant had notice of the dissolution agreement; he had no right to put the security out of his hands without being sure that the respondent had no further claim to it and would not be prejudiced by a release. Not having done this he must take the consequences of his negligence and cannot now sue the co\u2011debtor, whose clear right of redemption he has destroyed, for the personal debt.\nI prefer putting my judgment on the same ground as the Court of Appeal, not that I can have now any doubt about the Chancellor being perfectly right in the second ground on which he placed his judgment so far as regards the law. The case of Swire v. Redman[16] cannot now be regarded as a binding authority if it ever was one. Rouse v. Bradford Banking Co.[17] even if it has not demonstrated that Oakeley v. Pasheller[18] was originally an authority against the doctrine of Swire v. Redman[19], has at least shown that the construction put upon that case by Lord Cairns and Lord Hatherly in Overend Gurney & Co. v. Oriental Financial Corporation[20] and by the Irish Exchequer Chamber in Maingay v. Lewis[21] was such that the law must now be considered as settled in accordance with those decisions. I should have thought that when Pooley v. Harradine[22] and the class of cases to which that decision belongs had once decided that it was a good equitable defence to an action on a promissory note to show that a party appearing upon the paper to be primarily liable was in truth ab initio a mere surety for another party appearing to be secondarily liable, and that a creditor for value having no notice of such relationship when he took the paper was nevertheless upon having such notice bound to deal with the parties according to their real relationship and could not release the real principal without discharging the surety, that the whole question was conceded. I confess I think these decisions were very great innovations upon the rights of creditors, but I have never been able to see what difference it can make to the creditor, if he is to be bound by notice given to him after the debt is contracted, whether the parties were principal and surety ab initio or only became so by some subsequent arrangement between themselves of which he has notice. I entirely agree with the law as laid down by the Chancellor, whose view is now confirmed by Rouse v. Bradford Banking Co.17, and I should have probably considered myself bound by his finding on the question of notice, but I must say that I think the evidence on that point was very weak, and that too on a question the affirmative of which ought to be proved beyond all doubt, for if the rights of a creditor are to be affected by an agreement between his joint and several debtors that one shall thereafter be a principal and the other a mere surety I am of opinion that the clearest proof of notice should be given.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Hanna & Cowan.\nSolicitor for respondent: John A.

If he sells, for instance, through the medium of a board of directors who are not independent of him the contract may be rescinded provided the property remains in such a position that the parties may be restored to their original status.\nThere may be cases in which the property itself may be regarded as being bound by a trust either ab initio or in consequence of ex post facto events; if a promoter purchases property for the company from a vendor who is to be paid by the company when formed, and by a secret arrangement with the vendor a part of the price, when the agreement is carried out, comes into the hands of the promoter, that is a secret profit which he cannot retain; and if any part of such secret profit consists of paid-up shares of the company issued as part of the purchase price of the property such shares may, in winding-up proceedings, be treated, if held by the promoter, as unpaid shares for which the promoter may be made a contributory.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which affirmed the ruling of a master who had placed the respondent on the list of contributories of the company.\nThe material facts of this case, which are fully set out in the judgment of the court, may be briefly stated as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant, liquidator of the Hess Manufacturing Company which is being wound up under the Winding-up Act of Canada, seeks to have the respondent placed on the list of contributories under the following circumstances.\nIn 1889 two brothers named Hess, wishing to purchase a site for building a factory but not having the means to do so, applied to the respondent, who was father-in-law to one of them, to assist them and he entered into an agreement with the owners of the proposed site by which it was to be conveyed to him free of charge provided the contemplated factory was erected and running within a limited time, and if not he was to pay $3,000 for it. The respondent had the factory built and received a conveyance from the owners and a company was formed to carry on the manufacturing of furniture of which he was a provisional director subscribing for shares to the amount of $7,500. The building had cost over $7,000, and some $5,000 was expended on it after its completion.\nThe respondent after its formation transferred to the company the property so purchased with the building having previously mortgaged it for $7,000, and was allotted 360 shares of paid-up stock of the value of $50 a share. The company having failed the liquidator appointed under the winding\u2011up act applied to the master to have the respondent placed on the list of contributories for these 360 shares. It appearing that 234 shares had been transferred before the winding-up proceedings commenced the master acceded to the request in respect to the remaining 126 holding that when the respondent bought the property he did so as trustee for the contemplated company and had consequently given no value for his stock. This decision was affirmed by the Divisional Court but reversed by the Court of Appeal and the liquidator has appealed to this court.\nThe directors of the company when the property was transferred by the respondent were his son and the Hess brothers one of whom was his son-in-law.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and Raney for the appellant. Dr. Sloan got these shares without paying the full consideration and is liable to account to the company Society of Practical Knowledge v. Abbott[3]; Pagin & Gill\u2019s case[4]; White\u2019s case[5].\nThe last two cases are authority for placing him on the list of contributories.\nThere is no doubt that respondent stood in a fiduciary relation to the proposed company and that the contract with him might have been rescinded; New Sombrero Phosphate Co. v. Erlanger[6]; and if he was a trustee the contract with him could not have been ratified by the shareholders; Flitcroft\u2019s case[7]; Mann v. Edinburgh Northern Tramways Co[8]. And see Hichens v. Congreve[9]; Beck v. Kantorowicz[10]. It is not necessary that we should show fraud if the company never received value for the shares. In re Eddystone Marine Insurance Co.[11]; Ooregum Gold Mining Co. v. Roper[12]; Lydney & Wigpool Iron Ore Co. v. Bird[13].\nMoss Q.C. and Haverson for the respondent. If shares are paid for in money\u2019s worth instead of money they must be treated in winding-up proceedings as fully paid up. In re Baglan Hall Colliery Co.[14]\nAdmitting that Dr. Sloan was a promoter that would not debar him from selling his property to the company provided he observed the duties appertaining to the relation of a promoter to the company. New Sombrero Phosphate Co. v. Erlanger[15]. At all events the only remedy would be recission of the contract of sale.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal in a proceeding instituted under a Dominion Act of Parliament for the winding-up of the Hess Manufacturing Company (Limited), a joint stock company incorporated by letters patent under the general act of Ontario. The liquidator made an application to the master in ordinary to place the name of Dr. Sloan, the respondent, on the list of contributories in respect of 360 shares of $50 each. The master decided in favour of the liquidator as regarded 126 shares (of the aggregate nominal value of $6,300), and dismissed the application as to the remaining 234 shares. Both parties having appealed the appeals were heard before Mr. Justice Meredith, who sustained the master\u2019s ruling. The present respondent, Dr. Sloan, then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which court allowed the appeal by a majority composed of Osler, Maclennan and Ferguson JJ., the Chief Justice dissenting. The liquidator has now, pursuant to leave given by an order in chambers, appealed to this court.\nThe facts material to the appeal may be stated as follows:\u2014\nIn 1889 William Hess and Emil Hess, his son, who were then out of business and not in good credit in consequence of having met with losses by fire, were desirous of establishing a furniture manufactory. They found a site which they thought would answer their purpose at the town of West Toronto Junction. This land belonged to R.S. McCormack, W.L. McCormack and Charles J. Boon. The Hesses were not in a position to take the title in their own name; they therefore applied to Dr. Sloan, the present respondent, who was the father-in-law of Emil Hess, to become the purchaser of this land, and to undertake the performance of the conditions upon which the owners agreed to convey it; to this request the respondent assented. Accordingly by an agreement dated in September, 1889, and made between the McCormacks and Boon of the one part, and Dr. Sloan, the respondent, of the other part, it was agreed that if Sloan should build upon the land within seven months a factory for furniture manufacture, with the capacity for employing not less than thirty hands, that then, when D.W. Clendennan and others, the purchasers of the west half of the lot, should pay their purchase money the vendors would convey the east half to the respondent, and if the respondent should not build the factory within seven months he would pay $3,000 purchase money for the same land, the factory if built within seven months being intended \u201cto wholly satisfy said purchase money.\u201d Soon afterwards the respondent entered into contracts for the erection of a factory which was accordingly built and competed in the month of March, 1890. The land was duly conveyed to Dr. Sloan by the vendors at some date prior to the 19th February, 1890; the exact date does not appear. Dr. Sloan who was then a physician practising at Blyth, in the county of Huron, was not at West Toronto Junction whilst the factory was being built, and the work was superintended by Emil Hess, his son-in-law, who acted under a power of attorney from the respondent. The respondent expended in the construction of the factory and the building appurtenant to it the sum of $7,300, and upwards of $5,200 had in addition been expended on the factory before its acquisition by the company, as will be hereafter mentioned, being money furnished for that purpose by Alice Hess, the wife of Emil Hess, and Elizabeth Hess the wife of William Hess. William Hess and Emil Hess also contributed their time, labour and services during the erection of the factory, the former in superintending and assisting in the mechanical part of the work, especially the plumbing, the latter giving his attention to the management of the financial and other business incidental to the enterprise. On the 27th of November, 1889, the Hess Manufacturing Company of West Toronto Junction (Limited) was incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal of the Province of Ontario, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 157 of the Revised Statutes of that province. The object and purpose of the company was stated in the letters patent to be the manufacturing and selling of all kinds of furniture. The capital stock of the company was fixed at $40,000, divided into 800 shares of $50 each. The place of business of the corporation was to be at West Toronto Junction. Dr. Sloan, Hugh Boulton Morphy and Francis Charles McDowell were named in the charter as the first directors of the company, and it was recited therein that William Sloan, the respondent, had taken shares to the amount of $7,500, and that Elizabeth Hess, Alice Grace Hess, Hugh Boulton Morphy and Francis Charles McDowell had severally subscribed shares in varying amounts, and that nothing had been paid in upon any of the shares so subscribed for. These letters patent were granted pursuant to the statute, after due publication of advertisements as thereby required, upon a petition addressed to the Lieutenant-Governor. This petition was signed by the several parties mentioned as stockholders in the letters patent, representing themselves to be subscribers for the shares before mentioned.\nOn the 22nd December, 1889, a stock book of the company was opened, and the several parties before named signed a memorandum of agreement inscribed therein by which they agreed to take the number of shares mentioned in the letters patent.\nOn the 27th January, 1889, a general meeting of all the shareholders was held whereat all were present either in person or by proxy. Those present personally were H.B. Morphy, Emil G. Hess, William Hess and Elizabeth Hess. H.B. Morphy was the son-in-law of William Hess, Emil G. Hess was his son, and Elizabeth Hess his wife. There were also present by proxy Dr. Sloan (the respondent), W.W. Sloan, his son, and Alice Hess, the daughter of Dr. Sloan and wife of Emil Hess. At this meeting W.W. Sloan, William Hess and Emil Hess were elected directors for the ensuing year. The following resolution was then passed:\u2014\nMoved by Alice Grace Hess and seconded by Emil George Hess: whereas arrangements have been made with Dr. William Sloan, of the Village of Blyth, in the County of Huron, for the purchase for the purposes of the company of the factory site (describing it) together with all the buildings erected on said described lands, there being a four\u2011story brick factory 45 by 127 feet, a boiler and engine house, one story, 26 by 55 feet, a brick dry kiln 36 by 50 feet, a brick smoke stack 85 feet high, and a frame stable erected on the land; and whereas the said Dr. Sloan has agreed to sell such land and buildings to the company for the sum of $25,000 payable as follows: The company to assume a mortgage of $7,000 on the said lands, and issue to the said Dr. Sloan $18,000 of paid-up capital stock of the company, the subscription for $7,500 of the said capital stock by Dr. Sloan to be included in such issue of paid-up stock for $18,000 and such subscription of $7,500 to be deemed therefore as merged therein. Resolved that the shareholders accept the terms of sale as herein stated with the said Dr. Sloan, and the directors of the company are hereby empowered and authorized to carry out such purchase and pass any necessary by-laws and execute all documents and make such entries in the books as are necessary to effectuate the same.\nThis resolution was confirmed at a directors\u2019 meeting held on the 21st March, 1890, and is also said to have been confirmed at a subsequent shareholders\u2019 meeting held on the 26th of April, 1890. On the 19th of February, 1890, Dr. Sloan mortgaged the property to secure $7,000 to the Canada Permanent Building Society, which corporation advanced that sum to him as a loan. This recouped his expenditure, less about $300. On the 21st of March, 1890, the property was conveyed by Dr. Sloan to the company pursuant to the resolution of the 27th of January, 1890, and additional shares to the number of 210 were entered in the stock book as being taken up by Dr. Sloan, making in all, with the 150 originally subscribed for, 360 shares, representing $18,000, and which were by the resolution of the 27th of January, 1890, to be all treated as paid by the conveyance of the property for which they and the $7,000 mortgage formed the consideration. Previous to the loan by the Canada Permanent Building Society the property was valued by the valuator for that company, Mr. Wellington J. Peck, at the sum of $25,100, and without entering upon any critical ex- animation of the evidence, which in the view I take is not very material, I may say at once that upon the \u201cevidence of the value of the land, and of the expenditure on the buildings and improvements, I consider this valuation to have been by no means an excessive one. These 360 shares so allotted to Dr. Sloan were therefore, according to the terms of the resolution of the 27th of January, 1890, to be, and were considered by all parties, and treated, as paid-up shares. Of these 360 shares Dr. Sloan subsequently, and at the instance of the Messrs. Hess, transferred 20 shares to Messrs. Hoover & Jackson who had assisted in starting the company, by way of remuneration for their services, and he also transferred 214 shares to Elizabeth Hess, the wife of William Hess, leaving 126 shares which were standing in his name at the date of the winding up order, and in respect of which the master has put him on the list as the holder of unpaid shares to that amount. These 126 shares, Dr. Sloan says, were intended to be transferred by him to his daughter, the wife of Emil Hess, it being intended, Dr. Sloan himself having been paid for his expenditure within $300 by the money raised on mortgage, that the paid-up shares were to be divided between the two ladies who had provided the residue of the money with which the factory had been built, to repay them for their outlay. That these ladies had expended at least $5,200, probably $5,500 or even more in this way, appears without contradiction from the evidence. By an arrangement between these parties, Dr. Sloan the respondent, and Mrs. William and Mrs. Emil Hess, the price received by him was to be thus apportioned. Dr. Sloan says he considered himself a trustee for these ladies for any residue of price remaining after he had been satisfied for his own outlay. This arrangement between the parties as to the disposition of the price can be no concern of the liquidator, the creditors, or the company, provided the latter got valuable consideration for what it gave; and by the conveyance by Dr. Sloan of the land and buildings the company did beyond question acquire a property worth $25,000, unless that property was, by the legal result of what had taken place already, upon equitable principles, the property of the company held by Dr. Sloan as a trustee for it. Upon this state of facts the master treated Dr. Sloan as the holder of 126 unpaid shares amounting to $6,300 for which sum the respondent has been placed upon the list of contributories.\nMy first proposition is that the master\u2019s whole proceeding was ultra his jurisdiction; that under the winding-up order he had no jurisdiction to entertain the question of Dr. Sloan\u2019s liability under the facts here in evidence that question being one which could only be properly litigated in an action in due form instituted by the liquidator on behalf of the company. In considering this case it must at the very outset strike any one that a judicial result which would have the effect of vesting in a joint stock company without any consideration whatever, absolutely for nothing, property which has been produced by an expenditure of certainly not less than $5,200, can hardly be a sound one, and yet that would have been virtually the effect of the master\u2019s order had it been allowed to stand. Granting for the sake of this argument all that is contended by the liquidator about the trust of the land itself, yet the company got more than the land; it got the improvements in the creation of which large sums of money had been invested, and I maintain if these 126 shares are now to be treated as unpaid shares the company would get these improvements gratuitously, by a lucrative title as a mere gift. The only principle upon which the master could have acted in making the order he did was in assuming that no consideration whatever had been given for the shares. If any consideration was given it was beyond the master\u2019s competence to inquire into the adequacy of it. For this, as I should expect, I find ample authority in the books. Shares can be paid for either in money or money\u2019s worth, and when paid for by property conveyed to the company the value of the property given in consideration will not be inquired into. On this head Lord Justice Lindley in his book on Company Law,[16] has the following passage:\u2014\nPreviously to the above enactment it had been decided, when the statute in question (that requiring in England an agreement in writing when payment is otherwise than in cash) does not apply, it may be taken as settled that shares may be fully paid up not only in money but in money\u2019s worth; and shares which are bon\u00e2 fide given as paid up in payment of property transferred to the company or of services rendered to it, or of claims against it, must on the winding up of a company be treated as paid up shares; and in the absence of fraud the court will not inquire into the value of that which is taken by the company in payment instead of money; for example, where payment was made in paper which turned out to be worthless it was nevertheless treated as duly made.\nAnd in Brice on Ultra Vires,[17] it is said:\u2014-\nShares must be paid for but not necessarily in money, and the amount of the consideration will not be examined by the courts.\nSo that unless a case of fraud was made and proved which could only be done in a formal action to rescind it must be held that there was a valuable consideration given bon\u00e2 fide for the 126 shares in question in the improvements alone, even granting that there was some trust as regards the land, and therefore the master in a winding-up proceeding could not say the shares were wholly without consideration and unpaid for, which he must be able to do before he can put a holder on the list as a contributory for unpaid shares. I wholly differ from the master when he refers his jurisdiction to the R.S.O. c. 157, section 61. That manifestly has no application here; to make it apply it must first be shown that the shares are unpaid. The master thus assumes that which is the very question in dispute. As no attempt has been made to demonstrate that this section 61 has any reference to such a case as this, I may content myself with the answer I have just given. It is, however, very apparent that consideration to the full value of the shares was received by the company, and this for the reasons given in the able judgments delivered by the three learned judges who formed the majority of the Court of Appeal, who very clearly demonstrated the correctness of their conclusions. I suppose no one can dispute the authority of The New Sombrero Phosphate Company & Others v. Erlanger & Others[18]. That case was decided in the House of Lords after two arguments, the last before an exceptionally large House consisting of nearly all the law lords of that day, and it is therefore as high an authority as could possibly be invoked. I am then content to let the present case be tested entirely by this case of The New Sombrero Company v. Erlanger18. In order to make out that there was no consideration for these shares it must then be proved that Dr. Sloan, when he conveyed to the company, was a mere trustee for it. This cannot be better put than it is by Mr. Justice Osler in his judgment, where he says:\u2014\nIn a case like the present the liquidator must make out that at the time the purchase was made the appellant stood in such a position that he could not claim to have bought the property for himself; in other words, that he was not in a position to sell to the company when afterwards formed, because that company, when it came into existence, had already acquired the right to say that the purchase was made by the appellant for them, and not for himself.\nThe evidence shows that a joint stock company was contemplated from the beginning, a company which might take over the land acquired by Dr. Sloan after a factory had been built upon it. But was there any trust which such a company could have enforced against Dr. Sloan, or could Dr. Sloan after bringing the company into existence have compelled it to accept the land and to indemnify him for his expenditure upon it? This is the test question and it admits of but one answer; most emphatically no enforceable trust of the kind just mentioned ever existed. Dr. Sloan could, after building the factory, have refused to convey it to a company; he could have sold it to any purchaser, or he could have kept it and worked the factory himself; or he might have abstained from building at all on the land, have paid the purchase money of $3,000 and thus have acquired the title to the land which the vendors would have been bound to convey to him on payment of the ascertained price. This is law which no one can gainsay, for it is, as the learned judges who were the majority in the Court of Appeal have shown, the law as laid down in all the opinions delivered in the House of Lords in the New Sombrero case, and thus expressed in a passage in the speech of the Lord Chancellor given as a quotation in the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler, but which is in words so apposite to the present case that I must repeat it. Lord Cairns says:\nThe syndicate in entering into this contract acted on behalf of themselves alone and did not at that time act in or occupy any fiduciary position whatever. It may well be that the prevailing idea in their mind was not to retain or work the island, but to sell it again at an increase of price, and very possibly to promote or get up a company to purchase the island from them; but they were, it seems to me, perfectly free to do with the island whatever they liked, to use it as they liked and to sell it how and to whom and for what price they liked.\nIt is not merely because the language of the Lord Chancellor in the extracted passage is adapted to the facts disclosed by the evidence in the present case that it is of value here, but for the further reason that it makes with great exactitude and clearness a distinction which is the key to the decision in the Erlanger case and must be decisive in the present case. Lord Cairns here distinguishes between a trust for the company of the property acquired by the promoters and afterwards sold to the company, which he says did not exist in the case before him, and which may with confidence be said not to have existed in the present case\u2019 and that fiduciary relationship which is engendered by the promoters of a company, between themselves and the company, coming into existence so soon as the latter is formed. This is a distinction running through all the cases but one which has not always been sufficiently kept in mind. As regards any trust of the land acquired from McCormack by the respondent, I repeat, there was none. On the one hand Dr. Sloan was as free to deal with the company in respect of it as if it had been property of which he had been the owner for thirty years before he sold to this company, but on the other hand he was beyond all doubt a promoter of this company and whether he sold it this land which he and those whose interests he represented had acquired with a view of building upon it a factory and afterwards transferring it to a company or whether he sold them land which he had bought and paid for years before, in neither case could he deal with the company as an ordinary vendor, who had had nothing to do with the promotion of the company, might have done; he could only sell under the restrictions which courts of equity have imposed upon fiduciary vendors of the particular class known as promoters of joint stock companies. Thus it was incumbent upon him to sell the land for no excessive price; he was bound to misrepresent nothing which could influence the company in determining whether to buy or not; to conceal nothing that it was material should be known in order to enable them to form a sound judgment on that question, and to put them in possession of all material information. Further it was above all the duty of Dr. Sloan as a vendor selling property to a company towards which he stood in a fiduciary relation to see that the executive management of the company was in the hands of a thoroughly independent board of directors, a board over which he could exercise no influence and which would, as the expression is, keep him at \u201carms\u2019 length\u201d in making the bargain. Some of these duties Dr. Sloan performed but not all. Now it was because the promoters failed in the performance of their duties, because, they were guilty of misrepresentation and concealment as to the price they had paid and in other respects, that the House of Lords upheld the judgment which set aside the sale in the New Sombrero Phosphate Company\u2019s case. It was not in that case decided that there was no consideration whatever for the conveyance of the island, nor that any paid-up shares which had found their way into the hands of the vendors as part of the consideration were wholly unpaid shares, nor that the company had merely acquired what was already their own property; but in that action, which was one to set aside the contract not as void but only as voidable in equity, it was decided that the sale must be rescinded and the parties put in statu quo; that is that the property was to be re-conveyed to the promoters who had sold it and the price returned by them to the vendors. Whilst I say that this distinction between a trust of the property and the personal fiduciary relationship of the vendors exists, and that it is the very turning point in most of the cases which have been determined upon this question of the validity of sales by promoters, I am far from saying that there may not possibly be a case in which the property itself may be regarded as being bound by a trust in some cases ab initio, in others in consequence of ex post facto events. For instance, if a promoter of a company acquires property ostensibly for the company from a vendor who is by the terms of the bargain to be paid by the company when it comes into existence, either in money or shares, and the company is formed and this agreement is carried out, and part of the price which has been paid by the company finds its way in pursuance of some secret arrangement between the vendor and the promoter into the hands of the latter, that is a secret profit which the promoter who in such a supposed case has put himself in the position of an agent for the company cannot retain. It makes no difference that in such a case the property may have passed through the hands of the promoter and have been formally conveyed by him to the company; it would be in no sense his own property which he would in such a case be deemed to convey, but the property of the company. In this hypothetical case there would be no contract to rescind; that would not be the appropriate relief; and although the company might not be in a position to ask for rescission by reason of its having conveyed away the property, it would still be entitled to compel the promoter to account for and repay his secret profit, and if any portion of that consisted of paid-up shares of the company issued as such as part of the consideration still held by the promoter, such shares might in a winding-up proceeding be treated as unpaid shares. But the supposed case, of which the Emma Silver Mining Co. v. Grant[19] is an example, is not the case here; this property was acquired not for the company, and the consideration which consisted of the money expended in building the factory was not paid for out of the funds of the company but by Dr. Sloan and those he represented out of their own monies, just as in the New Sombrero case and other cases to which I will refer.\nThe principles of decision which are thus to be applied here have been given as the rationes decidendi in many other cases besides the New Sombrero case.\nThus in Gover\u2019s Case[20], Lord Justice James says:\u2014\nAt the time when this agreement was made there was no company in existence, and no promoter, trustee, or director; the company had not even an inchoate existence except in the brain of Mappin; and the utmost that could be said of Mappin was that he was a projector of a company which he intended and had agreed to promote.\nAgain Lord Justice James says:\u2014\nIt is surely open to any man, in point of law, to sell his property to a joint stock company and to invite persons to form themselves into a joint stock company to purchase from him, just as it is open to any man to sell to any persons in the world the right to become his partners in any property or undertaking. * * * No impropriety in the contract can make it the contract of the company, or the contract of a promoter, trustee, or director of a company, when at the date of the contract there was no company, no promoter, no trustee, no director. The character of the contract cannot operate as a transformation of the contracting parties.\nI may illustrate my view by referring to a contract which, I think, would be within the act. If, instead of contracting to sell to the company, or inviting the company to become shareholders in the thing itself, Mappin had invited them to become shareholders with him in a contract, and they had accepted that invitation, then he would, by the terms of his offer, and by their acceptance of that offer, have made himself their agent as from the date of that contract, and any bye or collateral contract made for his own benefit would be a contract by a trustee for the company or partnership. In the same case Lord Justice Bramwell puts the pith of the judgment of the court in a very few words. He says:\u2014\nHere Mappin entered into the contract, not as promoter but as intending to be so.\nThe doctrines promulgated in this case of Grover\u2019s in which Lord Justices James, Mellish and Bramwell concurred have never been displaced but have been recognized as sound, and acted upon in all subsequent cases. The distinction to which I have adverted was also acted upon and was the groundwork of the judgments of Pearson J.[21] and the Court of Appeal[22] in Re Cape Breton Co. Lord Justice Cotton in the course of his judgment in that case says:\u2014\nNumerous cases have been brought before the Court, but none of them are like the present, because in all the cases where relief was given the case was that of a trustee or a director who had sold to the company, at an enhanced price, property which he had acquired when he was a trustee or director, and he was held to be liable for the difference on the ground that at the time he acquired his interest in the property he was in the position of a trustee. The principle of those cases is very clear. It is this: That having bought the property while he was a director, and so in the position of a trustee for the company, and having afterwards made it over to the company without disclosing his interest, he was estopped from saying that he originally bought the property on his own behalf, or otherwise than for and on behalf of the company. When, therefore, he pays a large additional sum of money out of the coffers of the company for the property, he is putting into his own pocket a sum of money by way of purchase money paid by the company for that which was already their own.\nLord Justice Fry in the same case makes some observations peculiarly apposite to the present case. He says:\u2014\nIt appears to me that to allow the principal to affirm the contract, and after the affirmance to claim, not only to retain the property, but to get the difference between the price at which it is bought and some other price, is, however you may state it, and however you may turn the proposition about, to enable the principal against the will of his agent to enter into a new contract with the agent, a thing which is plainly impossible, or else it is an attempt on the part of the principal to confiscate the property of his agent on some ground which, I confess, I do not understand.\nThis case of the Cape Breton Company was not one of an action to rescind but was a proceeding under the 165th section of the Companies Act, 1862, to make a director account for a profit he had made on the sale of certain properties to the company. It was held by the Court of Appeal that he was not so answerable, and further, that the property having been in the course of winding-up proceedings sold so that the company could not restore it if the contract were set aside it was too late for rescission. The House of Lords[23] affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal upon the ground that the shareholder who made the application had not any interest sufficient to give him a locus standi being a holder of fully paid-up shares in a limited company which had become insolvent. The law as laid down in the judgments of the Lords Justices Cotton and Fry has, however, never been questioned nor could it be, since it conforms in all respects to the decision of the House of Lords in the New Sombrero case. In Re Ambrose Lake Tin and Copper Mining Company[24], Lord Justice Cotton, dealing with an order similar to that made by the master in the present case, which had been made by the Vice-warden of the Stannaries Court in a winding-up proceeding, thus forcibly and clearly stated the true doctrine:\u2014\nThe principle of the order must he this, that the company are at liberty to treat these persons as trustees of the property for the company, and, treating them as trustees, to allow them only what they paid for the property, and if they got anything else out of the coffers of the company to make them account for that. Neither on principle nor on authority can that be maintained, unless at the time when the so-called vendor acquired the property he either acquired it for the company, or was in such a position of fiduciary relation to the company that any purchase made by him of property available for the company must be considered as a purchase made by him as a trustee for the company. In that case what the Court does is to go back to the original purchase made by the person who afterwards purports to sell to the company at an advanced price, and to say this was already the company\u2019s at the price which you originally gave for it when you were a trustee for the company. That price you are entitled to receive out of the coffers of the company, and anything else is a sum paid to you for nothing, which you are not entitled to retain. * * * I can quite understand an action to set aside the contract altogether, but that is not the course adopted by the company. I can see no ground either on principle or authority on which the company can say, not seeking to set aside the contract, \u201cWe will hold you as passing this to the company, not because you originally acquired it for the company, but because you entered into a contract to sell to the company, which is not binding, and therefore we make another contract to take it from you for what it originally cost you, making you account for whatever else under that invalid contract you stipulated should be paid for it.\u201d\nI may be excused for making this long quotation since every word of it has a direct bearing on the case before us, and it is besides a very clear exposition of the doctrines which prevailed in the Erlanger case. It shows that the master\u2019s order was in the very teeth of existing authority and is conclusive of the present appeal.\nThe last case which I shall refer to is that of the Ladywell Mining Company v. Brookes [25] the circumstances of which have a remarkable resemblance to those in evidence here. There it was again held that the fact that the parties who sold the property to the company were the promoters of the company, and had the company in contemplation when they acquired the property, did not make them trustees for the company of the property itself. And further, that although as promoters they stood in a fiduciary relation to the company when they afterwards sold to it, and that not having complied with all the obligations incumbent on them as fiduciary vendors the contract might for that reason have been rescinded, yet that it was too late for rescission as the landlord of the property (which was leasehold) had entered and avoided the lease for a forfeiture. Lord Justice Cotton in his judgment entirely adheres to what he had stated in his former judgments in the cases already cited on the point of there being no trust ab initio, and he also confirms what he had said in the Cape Breton case[26], as to its being too late for rescission. The opinion of Lord Justice Lindley is to the same effect, and this is worthy of note inasmuch as that very learned judge has always shown a disposition to go further in giving relief in this class of cases than other judges have thought possible. Upon the point that there can be no rescission without a re\u2011conveyance of the property Lord Justice Lindley is very distinct. He says:\u2014\nThere might be a case for rescission if rescission were possible, but rescission is not possible because the property acquired by the company does not belong to the company any longer. The landlord has taken possession and rescission is out of the question.\nThe judgment of Lord Justice Lopes is also in entire accordance with those of the other judges on both points. I am therefore justified in saying that this case is another conclusive authority against the present appellant. Many other reported cases might be added to those I have specifically mentioned; those cited, however, are so distinct in their terms, so exactly applicable, and are decisions of courts of such high authority, that no further citations are necessary to establish the propositions of law upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is founded. I admit that there are dicta by text writers attributable, I think, to confounding cases which merely establish that a promoter stands in a fiduciary relation to the company with those which hold that he is to be considered as a trustee of property which he actually acquires for the company, but these dicta cannot possibly outweigh the judgments of the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal which proceed entirely on a recognition of a difference between the two cases.\nI consider, therefore, that it is fully established that Dr. Sloan was never a trustee for the company of the property which he conveyed to it by the conveyance of the 21st of March, 1890; that, therefore, the master was wrong in his adjudication that the respondent was a holder of 126 unpaid shares and liable to contribute as such; and that this order would have been also erroneous even if it had been established that Dr. Sloan had acquired the land at West Toronto Junction as a trustee for the company since there had been a large expenditure on that property, either by Dr. Sloan or by those he represents (it matters not which), which if the master\u2019s order was allowed to stand the company would get without any consideration, thus making it operate as nothing short of confiscation of the money which the evidence shows the wives of the Messrs. Hess had honestly expended in the improvements; a result as unwarrantable by any doctrine of courts either of law or equity as it is repugnant to one\u2019s notions of justice and fairness.\nThere can of course be no rescission, which is the only remedy where there has been non\u2011observance by a fiduciary vendor, such as a promoter who sells property to the company, of the rules of equity governing such sales, for the property has been sold[27] and cannot be restored, and in any event relief by way of rescission is beyond the jurisdiction of the master in a winding-up proceeding under the Dominion statute. Then, it is not competent in such cases to the master, not having jurisdiction to rescind, to make the vendor account for any profit which may have accrued to him or to those whom he represented. This is made apparent by a passage in the judgment of Lord Justice Cotton in the Cape Breton Company case[28], and by Lord Cairns in the New Sombrero case, where the question is passed upon in the following terms:\nThat part of the case of the respondents which, as an alternative, sought to make the appellants account for the profit which they made on the re-sale of the property to the respondents, on an allegation that the appellants acted in a fiduciary position at the time they made the contract of the 30th of August, 1871, is not, as I think, capable of being supported, and this, as I understand, was the view of all the judges in the courts below.\nIt is therefore out of the question to say that the master\u2019s order is to be supported because the $6,300 which is represented by these 126 shares was an amount less than or equal to a profit which was derived by the sale to the company. Further, in point of fact, even if it was open to the master, proceeding under the winding-up act, to give such relief as that last alluded to, the facts would not warrant it, for it is, I think, sufficiently established that the $25,000 which the respondent received for the conveyance was not in excess of the value of the property which the company acquired under that deed. This is, I think, a fair conclusion from the evidence, even if we assume the shares to have been worth their par value in the market, but I have shown in an early part of this judgment that where it is said that shares must be paid up in money or money\u2019s worth, that by no means involves the proposition that the property must be equal to the nominal value of the shares; on the contrary, decided cases show that the courts will not inquire into the value in the absence of fraud.\nTherefore from every point of view the order made in the master\u2019s office is unsustainable.\nThis being the proper disposition of the case it is of course extra judicial to say anything about what might have been the result of an action for rescission had the same facts been presented in that form; I do so, however, to prevent any misapprehension, so that it may not be supposed that in anything I have said I have presumed to detract in any way from the salutary rules which have been laid down by the English courts as governing the contracts of promoters with the companies they have brought into life. Of course an action for rescission must have failed for the reason before mentioned that in consequence of the sale of the property the parties could not be put in statu quo[29]. But if it had not been for that circumstance I think such an action must have succeeded. Disinterested as was the conduct of Dr. Sloan throughout these transactions, which resulted in a loss to him of some $275 besides infinite trouble and annoyance, and free as he has been from first to last from the imputation of any selfish object, he has still, I think, been wanting in his duty as a person who at the time of the sale stood toward this company in a fiduciary relation, that is to say as having been one of its promoters.\nWithout undertaking to give an exhaustive description of these duties I will say that they at least include the obligations before stated, viz., those of selling for a price not exorbitant; concealing nothing that it was proper the directors of the company should know in order to form a fair judgment as to the value of the property; and making no misrepresentations of facts material to the purchase. All these requirements, I think, Dr. Sloan sufficiently complied with. There remains, however, another duty which the respondent did not perform. It is in such cases as the present the duty of one who has been a promoter of the company to see that his contracts with it are made through the medium of a board of directors who are entirely independent of him, that is a board comprised of persons who are entirely free of his influence; men who are not mere instruments subject to his dictation and subservient to his interests; and with such a board he must deal at arm\u2019s length. This obligation was not properly fulfilled in the agreement for sale of the 27th of January, 1890, nor when the conveyance was afterwards executed on the 21st of March, 1890, for no one can for a moment suppose that the board, com-posed as it was, was an independent body unsusceptible to the influence of Dr. Sloan and the cestuis que trust whose interests he represented. The object of requiring that the board of directors should in case of this kind be independent persons, free from any control or influence which the promotor could exercise over them, is the protection of the shareholders, and as this includes the protection of future shareholders as well as those who have already become such no ratification by the existing body of shareholders can so confirm the transaction as to make it free from impeachment by one who has not been an actual party to the confirmation. That this is the law is also established by Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company[30].\nI make these last observations not with any view of reflecting on Dr. Sloan but in order to guard against any inference that I had taken it upon myself to disregard rules of law laid down by very great lawyers in deciding a case in the House of Lords.\nFor these reasons, which are in the main the same as those given in the judgments in which the majority of the Court of Appeal have recorded their opinions, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dewart & Raney.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Haverson & St. John.\n[1] 21 Ont.

W. who had endorsed to secure a part of the existing debt thereupon gave A. a guarantee in the form of a letter as follows:\u2014\n\u201cI understand that you are prepared to furnish C. & Co. with stock to the extent of $5,000 as a current account but want a guarantee for any amount beyond that sum. In order not to impede their operations I have consented to become responsible to you for any loss you may sustain in any amount upon your current account in excess of the said sum of five thousand but the total amount not to exceed eight thousand dollars, including your own credit of five thousand, unless sanctioned by a further guarantee.\u201d * * * A. then continued to supply C. & Co. with goods and in an action by him on this guarantee:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that there could be no liability on this guarantee unless the indebtedness of C. & Co. to A. should exceed the sum of $5,000, and at the time of action brought such indebtedness having been reduced by payments from C. & Co. and dividends from their insolvent estate to less than such sum A. had no cause of action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe decision in the case turns on the construction of the guarantee set out in the above head\u2011note. The facts are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick. Christopher Robinson Q.C, and Clark Q.C, for the appellant referred to In re Sherry[1]; Martin v. McMullen[2].\nDelamere Q.C. and English for the respondent cited Pike v. Dickinson[3].\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014I am in favour of dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by the majority in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is very important to bear in mind the character and particulars of the debt of Charlesworth & Co. to the plaintiff at the time that they procured the defendant, who was the uncle of one of the partners of the firm of Charlesworth & Co., and who was security for the company to a bank to the amount of $65,000 and deeply interested in the success of the company, to give to the plaintiff the guarantee sued upon, and also what had passed between the plaintiff and Charlesworth & Co., which caused the latter to procure the defendant to give the guarantee.\nImmediately prior to the 11th August, 1886, when the guarantee was given, the debt of Charlesworth & Co. to the plaintiff as found by the referee amounted to the sum of $10,486.95, of which sum $1,262.14 was in respect of customers\u2019 paper discounted by the plaintiff for Charlesworth & Co. The referee has also found that the plaintiff was also the holder of notes made or endorsed by the defendant as surety for the firm in respect of $3,431.30, portion of their debt to the plain- tiff, and that when the guarantee was given one of the said notes for the sum of one thousand dollars was delivered up by the plaintiff to the defendant.\nThe account for bills, etc., discounted by the plaintiff for the firm, as appears by Exhibit L attached to the referee\u2019s report, was as follows:\u2014\nBILLS DISCOUNTED BY PLAINTIFF FOR FIRM.\nWhen discounted. 1886.\nName.\nDate due.\nAmount.\nMarch 22d,\nForbes,\nNov. 24th,\n$185.41\nJuly 24th,\nMagee,\nOct. 26th,\n153.00\ndo.\nMunro,\nNov. 17th,\n202.30\ndo.\nWeir,\nNov. 25th,\n76.00\ndo.\nWilson,\nDec. 8th,\n195.43\nJuly 22d,\nCrabb,\nNov. 25th,\n450.00\n$1,262.14\nThe second, third and fourth of the above items were endorsed by the defendant.\nThe debt of Charlesworth & Co. to the plaintiff then consisted of two parts, the one secured, the other unsecured. The secured portion consisted of $4,262.14, for $3,431.30 of which the defendant himself was the security, and the unsecured portion, resting upon the credit of Charlesworth & Co. alone, amounted to $6,224.81; for this sum with the exception of $200 cash lent on the 30th July, 1886, the plaintiff held the promissory notes of Charlesworth & Co. alone for several sums, maturing respectively at various periods between the 11th August, 1886, and the 12th January, 1887.\nWhile the debt stood thus Charlesworth & Co. were pressing the plaintiff to furnish them with more goods on their own credit. This the plaintiff peremptorily refused to do.\nAfter some negotiation upon the subject the plaintiff finally consented to suffer $5,000 of the debt to stand as an open account, but insisted that for any further goods Charlesworth & Co. should require they must furnish security and that they must reduce their debt by cash or collaterals to the said sum of $5,000. To these terms Charlesworth & Co. acceded. Now, as the plaintiff already held, as shown above, security for $4,262.14 of the amount of Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s debt, no part of which was then due, it plainly never was nor could have been contemplated by the plaintiff or Charlesworth & Co. that the latter were either to pay cash or give collaterals by way of reduction of or security for notes so already secured and not yet due; or that the notes of Charlesworth & Co. for the unsecured portion, which the plaintiff had most probably discounted at and transferred to his bank, should be paid or secured by collaterals before they should mature. The reasonable construction of the agreement is that it was the unsecured amount of their debt to the plaintiff that Charlesworth & Co. had agreed to reduce by cash or collaterals to $5,000 and that the intent and understanding of the parties was that the notes given by Charlesworth & Co. for such unsecured portion, as they should mature, should be either paid in cash or secured by collaterals so as to leave the open account of $5,000 so agreed upon to stand upon their own security alone. This agreement having been arrived at with Charlesworth & Co. and the plaintiff, and the former having pressing need for further goods to be furnished to them by the plaintiff which he refused to give without security, they procured the defendant to give the guarantee sued upon. Horatio George Charlesworth, a witness called by the defendant, and who procured the guarantee to be given and in whose handwriting it is, says:\u2014\nHe (the plaintiff) refused to give us any more credit for goods unless we would secure him in some way, and a guarantee from Mr. Watson was suggested, and that was obtained and banded to Mr. Alexander.\nThe guarantee so procured is as follows:\u2014\nTORONTO, 11th August, 1886.\nD.W. ALEXANDER, ESQ.,\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I understand you are prepared to furnish Charlesworth & Co., with stock to the extent of five thousand dollars, as a current account, but want a guarantee for any amount beyond that sum. In order not to impede their operations I have consented to become responsible to you for any loss you may sustain in any amount upon your current account in excess of the said sum of five thousand, but the total amount not to exceed eight thousand dollars, including your own credit of five thousand dollars, unless sanctioned by a further guarantee, and the note for one thousand dollars now held by you to be given up.\nYours truly, JAS. WATSON.\nUpon the guarantee being handed by Charleswortb & Co. to the plaintiff a note of the defendant which the plaintiff held as security for $1,000, part of Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s debt to the plaintiff, was, as the referee has found, delivered up to the defendant, and the defendant took from one Dunspaugh his promissory note for $3,000 as an indemnity against the defendant\u2019s liability on the said guarantee, and (Dunspaugh having become insolvent) proved against his estate in respect of the said note for $3,000 and has received a dividend thereon. By this arrangement the secured portion of Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s debt to the plaintiff was reduced to $3,262.14, and the unsecured portion increased to $7,224.81.\nUpon the faith of this guarantee the plaintiff supplied Charlesworth & Co. with goods to the amount of $3,000. The goods so supplied slightly exceeded that sum, but the plaintiff\u2019s claim is limited by the guarantee to $3,000.\nUpon the 20th November, 1886, Charlesworth & Co., having failed, made an assignment for the benefit of their creditors, and their estate being insufficient to pay their liabilities in full this action is brought against the defendant upon his guarantee, and the referee to whom the action was referred has found that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $2,188.01 with interest from 1886, that is as I understand him to mean from the date of the assignment on the 20th November, 1886.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention now is threefold.\n1st. That the guarantee was given upon the faith, expressed, as is contended, upon its face, that the plaintiff should thereafter furnish goods to Charlesworth & Co. to the amount of $5,000 as the plaintiff\u2019s proportion of the contemplated open current account, which he never did, and that therefore the guarantee never had any force or effect at all.\n2nd. That upon the true construction of the guarantee it is necessary that the plaintiff must have the full amount of his share of the current account, namely, $5,000, before the guarantee becomes available to him; that the guarantee merely secures the plaintiff against the loss of any greater amount than $5,0C0 upon the contemplated account current; and\n3rd. That assuming the defendant to be at all liable under the guarantee he is not liable to the amount found by the referee for that on or about the 1st of November, 1886, Charlesworth & Co. placed in the hands of the plaintiff collaterals to the amount of $2,984.04 out of which after the assignment but before any dividend was paid on the Charlesworth insolvent estate the plaintiff realized $2,588.17, a considerable portion of which, as contended by the defendant, was applicable to the liquidation of that portion of Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s debt to the plaintiff, to which the defendant\u2019s guarantee applied.\nThere is no foundation, in my opinion, for either of the first two of these contentions. I cannot upon the evidence entertain a doubt that the defendant well knew that Charlesworth & Co. had then an account with the plaintiff upon which they were indebted to him in an amount exceeding $5,000, and that he \u2018 refused to supply them with any more goods without security. The defendant well knew also, for he admits that Charlesworth & Co. so informed him, that it was important with them that their account with the plaintiff should not be stopped\u2014that they should continue to get credit from him which they could not get without furnishing security.\nInterested also as the defendant was, and admits himself to have been, in the maintenance of the credit of Charlesworth & Co., and in their business being carried on, the plain intention of the defendant in giving the guarantee and handing it to Charlesworth & Co. to be used by them was that they should use it for the purpose of perfecting their arrangement with the plaintiff, by giving it to him as security for such goods as the defendant should require to its extent; the plain purpose and intent was that the current account mentioned in the guarantee, for $3,000 of which the defendant agreed to become responsible, was an account limited to $8,000 consisting of $5,000 then due and unsecured from Charlesworth & Co. to the plaintiff and the $3,000 for which the defendant became responsible.\nIt appears further by the referee\u2019s report that Charlesworth & Co. not only paid upon the unsecured portion of their debt to the plaintiff as the notes representing such debt matured but also paid part of the two notes for $1,000 each secured by the defendant; and at the time of Charlesworth & Co. making their assignment on the 20th Nov., 1886, they had paid upon the unsecured portion of their debt the sum of $2,235.36 (as appearing in Exhibit G), which sum being de- ducted from the sum of $7,224.78 the total amount of the unsecured account left the sum of $4,989.42 the amount due upon the unsecured account at the date of the assignment, to which being added the $3,000, amount of defendant\u2019s guarantee, made the open account to which that guarantee applied, when it was then finally closed, to be $7,989.42. The defendant\u2019s liability was then three-eighth parts of the account so closed. To this amount interest would have to be added until the account should be liquidated in whole or in part; and in three-eighths of so much of that amount as still remains due the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff.\nNot knowing the dates or date at which the plaintiff received dividends upon Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s estate we cannot tell the amount of interest to be added to the above sum in order to determine accurately the amount remaining due after deducting the amount of dividends paid but we can, apart from such interest, determine the amount to which the above sum, treating it as principal, is reducible by the amount of dividend paid.\nThe referee\u2019s report shows that the estate of Charlesworth & Co. paid and the plaintiff has received 29 cents in the dollar, which upon the above sum of $7,989.42, amounts to the sum of $2,316.92, leaving the balance of $5,662.50. The defendant\u2019s liability, save in so far as the above interest and any other payments if any there be to the benefit of which the defendant is entitled may affect the account is three-eighths of this sum of $5,672.50, being $2,127.18. But the defendant contends and apparently with great reason that the $2,588.17 received by the plaintiff from the collaterals placed in his hands on or about the 1st Nov., 1886, was as applicable to the liquidation of that portion of the debt to which the defendant\u2019s guarantee applied as to any other portion. Now no part of that sum would be applicable to the payment of any part of the discounted paper amounting to $1,262.14 other than so much of such paper as should not be paid by the parties primarily liable thereon; and exhibit \u201cL\u201d attached to the referee\u2019s report seems to show that the sum of $179.90 was the total amount not so paid. Then exhibit \u201cG\u201d shows that at the time of the assignment there was due upon one of the sums of $1,000 secured by the defendant only $539.87, and upon the other only $510.44, making together the sum of $1,050.31, to which being added the above $179.90 makes the sum of $1,230.21 as the whole amount besides the account to which the defendant\u2019s guarantee applied, to which the said sum of $2,588.17 was apparently applicable.\nIt does therefore, seem, unless capable of some explanation which I do not see on the referee\u2019s report, that the defendant is entitled to some considerable benefit from the collaterals upon which the plaintiff received, the said sum of $2,588.17.\nI think therefore that though the appeal must be allowed with costs in all the courts the case must be referred back to the court in which the action was instituted and is pending with direction that it should be ascertained by reference to the same or to some other referees what appropriation was made by the plaintiff of the said sum of $2,588.17, and of any other sums if any received from the said collaterals, for the purpose of determining what amount if any of the amount of the said collaterals of $2,984.04 received by the plaintiff, if any, should have been applied in reduction of the amount to which the defendant\u2019s guarantee applies; with the amount paid to the plaintiff by error in excess of what he was entitled to receive from Charlesworth & Co.\u2019s estate and for which he is liable to the estate the defendant has nothing to do beyond the amount of 1 cent per dollar which the referee has found to be his dividend share in that sum.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant is a wholesale leather merchant carrying on business in Toronto. Prior to the 11th August, 1886, he had been supplying leather and other goods to the firm of Charlesworth & Co., of the same city, and on that date the indebtedness of Charlesworth & Co. to him amounted to the sum of $10,486.95. It would appear that he, the appellant, became doubtful as to the credit of his customers and not only insisted that the amount of their indebtedness should be reduced to $5,000 but that if they required any further credit they could only get it upon furnishing security. Thereupon they applied to the defendant Thomas Watson who was interested to some extent in Charlesworth\u2019s affairs and he thereupon wrote out and delivered to the appellant a guarantee in the following form:\u2014\nTORONTO, 11th August, 1886.\nD.W. ALEXANDER, ESQ.,\nDEAR SIR, \u2014 I understand that you are prepared to furnish Charlesworth & Company with stock to the extent of $5,000 as a current account, but want a guarantee for any amount beyond that sum. In order not to impede their operations I have consented to become responsible to you for any loss you may sustain in any amount upon your current account in excess of the said sum of five thousand, but the total amount not to exceed eight thousand dollars, including your own credit of five thousand, unless sanctioned by a further guarantee, and the note for one thousand now held by you to be given up.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) JAMES WATSON.\nUpon receiving this document he gave up the one thousand dollar note therein mentioned, and subsequently sold them goods or advanced them money to the extent of $3,081.69.\nOn the 30th October, following, Charlesworth & Company failed. Their estate was realized and the appellant received his due proportion of the assets from the assignee of the estate. This action was com- menced against the guarantor on the 23rd December, 1889, to recover the sum of $3,000 alleged to be still due upon the defendant\u2019s guarantee, and was referred pursuant to section 102 of the Judicature Act to Mr. Clarkson, an accountant, as special referee. His findings so far as they are necessary, in my view, for the purpose of determining this appeal were that, on the day when the guarantee was given, Charlesworth & Company were indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $10,486.95. Between the date of that document and their failure the plaintiff had advanced to them on current account $3,081.69; that during the same period he had received from them on account $6,855.95, and that he had also received as dividends from the Charlesworth estate the sum of $3,186.16, leaving the net indebtedness to the plaintiff at the commencement of this action irrespective of interest $3,631 (the exhibits annexed to his report, however, showing the true amount to be $3,526.53); and he further found that the amount of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness upon his guarantee to the plaintiff was the sum of $2,188.01. for which amount with interest he ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff.\nUpon appeal from this report to Mr. Justice Rose it was confirmed.\nUpon the case being brought before the Court of Appeal judgment was ordered to be entered for the defendant, the appeal being unanimously allowed with costs.\nI am of opinion that, for the reason hereinafter pointed out, the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal as to the defendant\u2019s liability upon the guarantee in question is the correct one. Assuming the guarantee to have been what all parties seem to have understood it to be, namely, a proposal to continue to furnish Charlesworth & Co. with stock to the extent of $5,000 as a current account, I think the intention of the parties clearly was that the plaintiff was to continue to allow Charlesworth & Co. to be indebted to him in the sum of $5,000. They would not give him a credit beyond that sum unless such credit was guaranteed, and the agreement on the part of the guarantor was that if the plaintiff should sell to Charlesworth & Co. goods to the extent of $8,000, he, the guarantor, would pay any loss which the plaintiff might sustain in the event of Charlesworth & Co.s failure beyond the sum of $5,000, provided such excess did not exceed $3,000. There was nothing in the guarantee to prevent the plaintiff from giving an unlimited credit to the Charlesworths; they had, however, the defendant\u2019s guarantee to pay on account of such indebtedness $3,000 should it turn out that upon the final settlement of affairs the plaintiff\u2019s loss exceeded by $3,000 the $5,000 which they were to allow without security. Inasmuch, however, as according to the report of the referee the loss of the plaintiff in connection with the whole account was not $5,000 but only $3,526.53, there was no liability on the part of the defendant to which his guarantee could attach, although had an action been brought upon it at the time of the failure there would have been a liability, a liability wiped out in the interim by the dividends received from the estate.\nOn this ground I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014I concur in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Meredith, Clark, Bowes & Hilton.\nSolicitors for respondent: Delamere, Reesor, English & Ross.\n[1] 25 Ch.

The facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of the court, the main question for decision being the validity of the contract within the statute of frauds, the authority of brokers in New York to bind the defendants being disputed, and the right of defendants to have the wool forwarded to their place of business in Campbellford for inspection, plaintiffs contending that they were bound to inspect in New York.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C., and Clute Q C., for the appellants, argued that the agreement to buy goods \u201claid down in New York\u201d did not necessarily mean that New York was the place of delivery. If it was it did not follow that they must be inspected there. They relied on Perkins v. Bell[2], and cited also Grimoldby v. Wells[3]; Barnard v. Kellogg[4].\nMcCarthy Q.C., for the respondents, referred to Campbell on Sales[5].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an action brought by the respondents against the appellants for the non-acceptance of certain wool which the respondents agreed to sell to the appellants. The trial took place before Mr. Justice Falconbridge, without a jury, and the action was by him dismissed. This judgment was, however, reversed on appeal.\nThe appellants carry on a large woollen factory at Campbellford in Ontario. The respondents are merchants at New York, engaged in the wool trade there. On the 26th March, 1894, Messrs. Cass & Mote, brokers in New York, sent six samples of Buenos Ayres wool to the appellants, at the same time writing to them as follows: We send you by mail to-day some samples of Buenos Ayres wool as per memo below and wait your report on same.\nThe samples were numbered 126-127-129-130-131 and 132 and the prices of each lot were stated. To this letter the appellants replied on the 31st March, 1890, first by a telegram as follows:\nIf you will give us six months flat will take lots 127-128-129-130-131-132, answer quick.\nIt is explained in the evidence that the expression \u201csix months fiat\u201d meant payment by promissory note payable six months after date without interest. On the same day (the 26th March) the appellants confirmed their telegram by a letter in the same words. By telegram of the same date Messrs. Cass & Mote informed the appellants that the wool was on the other side of the Atlantic, a fact which they had omitted to mention in their letter, and on the same day they wrote confirming their telegram. The appellants in reply to the telegram sent the following:\nOur offer is for wool laid down in New York\nto which Cass & Mote replied by letter of the 1st of April, 1890, saying:\nWe so understand your offer.\nOn the 3rd of April the brokers sent to the appellants the following despatch:\nCan get 125-130-131, prices named four months, privilege six months adding sixty days interest, shall we take them? Cannot get other three lots, answer.\nTo this the appellants answered on the same day:\nIf you cannot get six months, to date from arrival of wool at New York, we withdraw our offer.\nTo this Messrs. Cass & Mote replied also on the same day:\nTelegram received have bought the three lots B.A. pulled at six months.\nThe mention of lot number 125 in Cass & Mote\u2019s telegram of the 3rd of April was clearly a mistake for 127; no such number as 125 was included in the list of lots originally sent to the appellants, and in the contract afterwards entered into, as will be stated, this mistake was rectified; although some stress was laid in the argument in the court below on this circumstance it is of no importance and no further notice of it will be taken here.\nThe contract was perfected by the delivery and transmission to the respective parties to the contract, that is to the respondents as vendors and to the appellants as vendees, of bought and sold notes the bought note having been sent to the appellants and the sold note handed to the respondents. These bought and sold notes were as follows:\nNEW YORK, April 3rd, 1890.\nBought for Trent Valley Woollen Co.\nFrom Messrs. Oelrichs & Co.\nN.Y. City.\nTo say\n127 about 14,000 lbs.

To arrive.\nTare, actual. CASS & MOTE,\nRemarks. Brokers.\nShip via. The appellants retained the bought note and made no objection either to the terms of the contract or to the authority of Messrs. Cass & Mote as brokers to bind them. On the 28th May, 1890, the wool arrived at New York of which the appellants were at once advised by telegram from the respondents to whom they replied also by telegram as follows:\u2014\nIf wool is equal to samples in our possession representing the lots send it on, if not do not want it.\nTo which the respondents replied:\nYou must accept the wool here before we ship it.\nThen ensued a correspondence between the parties by letter and telegraph in which the respondents insisted that they were not bound to forward the wool until it was accepted by the appellants in fulfilment of the contract and as equal to samples, and that they were not bound to forward the wool to Campbellford in order that the appellants might there examine and compare it with the samples, but that such examination must take place in New York, and in the course of which the appellants on their part contended that notwithstanding the terms of contract they were entitled to have the wool sent to Campbellford in order that it might be there inspected before acceptance by the respondents. The result was that the wool was stored on the New Jersey side of the port of New York, and ultimately sent to Canada; first to Sherbrooke and then to the Auburn Woollen Mills at Peterborough where it was used, a large reduction of price having been necessitated by a general fall in prices, and also by the reason of the wool having, after it arrived at New York and after it had been refused by the appellants, been damaged by moths.\nThe points insisted upon by the appellants in their defence to the action were, first, that there was no contract for the reason that Messrs. Cass & Mote were not the appellants\u2019 brokers and had no authority to sign the bought and sold notes as their agents, and secondly, because either upon the construction of the contract by itself, or with the addition of a term which it is said ought to be added to it, by implication, arising from the usage of trade, the appellants had the right to have the wool forwarded to them at Campbellford before acceptance in order that it might be there ascertained if it agreed with the samples.\nUpon the first point raised I am of opinion that the appellants were bound by the contract entered into by Cass & Mote; they knew perfectly well that Cass & Mote were dealing with them as brokers for the respondents, the real vendors, and their letters and telegrams sent in the course of the negotiations which preceded the signing of the brokers\u2019 notes implied authority to Cass & Mote to perfect the contract on their behalf. But even if there had been no original authority to Messrs. Cass & Mote to complete the contract on behalf on the appellants there was such acquiescence by the latter as amounted to ratification of the agreement embodied in the bought and sold notes and entered in the brokers\u2019 books. Mr. Owen, the appellants\u2019 manager, who acted for the company throughout the transaction out of which this dispute has arisen, in his evidence given at the trial, admits this very distinctly. I extract the following passage from his evidence:\u2014\nQ. You received a telegram from Cass & Mote; \u201cHave bought the lots B.A. pulled at six months\u201d Did you reply to that telegram? A. I do not think we did.\nQ. You were content to rest there? A. Certainly.\nQ. And you received the sold note or bought note, whichever it was, and you rested on that? A. Yes.\nQ. You did not object to that? A. No.\nQ. You did not write down to them and say \u201cYou have no right to sign that for us?\u201d A. We did not consider they signed it for us.\nQ. You rested on that as a transaction completed? A. Yes. These sale notes were signed by Cass & Mote as brokers as appeared from the bought note in which the whole bargain, including the names of both sellers and buyers, was stated and this gave the appellants distinct notice that the brokers were, if without authority, at least assuming, to act as their agents. If they objected to this they should at once have repudiated their act, but instead of doing anything of the kind they acquiesced as Mr. Owen states, and said nothing until the dispute about inspection and delivery arose. If authority is wanted in support of the view that the appellants were bound by the contract the authorities quoted in the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge, who decided against the appellants on this point, are decisive in the respondents\u2019 favour. The citation from Campbell on Sales[6] shows that from two distinct points of view the failure to object concludes the appellants. First, the bought and sold notes give each party information of the terms of the contract and afford an opportunity of objecting to the contract either as not within the authority of the broker, on any ground, personal, as regards the other party to the bargain, and \u201cthey further afford the presumption that the contract is ratified if no objection is made within a reasonable time\u201d\nFurther if the notes are acquiesced in and are in identical terms they \u201ccomplete a new consensus forming a good contract (and one valid within the Statute of Frauds) if there was not a valid contract already and a novation of the contract if there was\u201d\nThe appellants\u2019 manager himself, on his examination for the purposes of discovery, disclaims all objection on this head. He says:\u2014\nQ. And this fact did not suggest to you the advisability of keeping the samples? A. No; it never entered our head to keep the samples; we did not think it was necessary; if we had we would have kept them. We wanted it distinctly understood that we never tried to get out of the wool in any shape at all; there was no catch about it; we acted fair and honest.\nQ. I suppose the real question as far as your company is concerned is as to this question of inspection in New York, or the sending on to Canada for inspection?\nA. We claim we have always inspected at Campbellford.\nQ. That is the real difference between you?\nA. Certainly we did not try to get out of it in any other way. We never agreed to go to New York and never had gone to New York and we did not see why we should go to New York in this case.\nOf course no admission of this kind would preclude the appellants from insisting on any point of law arising upon the facts, and I do not refer to the evidence for any such purpose as that but as establishing the fact of acquiescence in the terms of the contract of sale which it certainly does beyond all question.\nThe contract therefore must be held to be sufficiently established and there remains only the question, which was the real issue between the parties, as to the performance of the contract. Were the appellants bound to inspect the wool and take delivery at New York, or were they entitled to have it forwarded to Campbellford for their inspection there? I should have said when stating the facts that, in the absence of any proof by the appellants that the wool was not equal to sample, there is sufficient prim\u00e2 facie evidence to establish the fact that it did agree with the sample and upon its arrival at New York was sound and merchantable wool. I refer to the testimony of Mr. Isherwood, a member of the Liverpool firm which sold the wool to the respondents, to that of Mr. Schlinghoff described as an \u201coutside man\u201d in the employ of the respondents who examined the wool at New York, and to that of Mr. Kendry, the manager of the Auburn Woollen Mills at Peterborough, who ultimately pur- chased and used it. If therefore it was material to the respondents\u2019 case to show that the goods agreed with the samples I take that fact to have been well proved in the absence of contradiction by the appellants.\nThen, were the appellants well founded in their claim to inspect the wool at Campbellford before taking delivery of it and giving the promissory notes for the price? That it was the intention and understanding of both parties that delivery should be at New York is evident from the appellants\u2019 second telegram of the 31st March, in which they say: \u201cOur offer is for wool laid down at New York\u201d; and from the letter of Messrs. Cass & Mote of the 1st of April replying thereto, in which they say: \u201cWe so understand your offer\u201d Therefore if we are entitled to consider this stipulation as to the wool being laid down at New York as forming a term of the contract, then the delivery was by the express contract of the parties to be at New York, and there the vendors were bound to deliver and the vendees to accept. This is further confirmed by the telegram of the 3rd of April in which the appellants say they will withdraw their offer unless the brokers can get six months\u2019 credit, to date from arrival of the wool at New York. The payment was to be by promissory note; the giving of this note and the delivery and final acceptance of the wool were according to settled construction to be concurrent acts; the vendors were therefore bound to accept or reject the wool promptly in order that the vendees might receive the paper representing the price which they were entitled to receive as soon after the arrival of the goods as would allow a reasonable interval for inspection. If these telegrams are to be excluded, and we are to confine the contract within the limits of the bought and sold notes which say nothing about any place of delivery, it will make no difference, as the law is that where the contract of sale is silent as to the place of inspection of goods sold by sample it is to be presumed that the purchaser is to accept the goods at the place of delivery which here was undoubtedly New York, being the place at which the contract was, made.\nTherefore upon the construction of the written contract, with or without the aid of the telegrams which preceded it, and excluding any addition to its terms by evidence of custom, it is plain that the respondents were right in their contention that the place of inspection was New York, and the respondents were not bound to forward the goods to Campbellford before receiving the note to be given for the price. That this is the law is apparent from the cases of Perkins v. Bell[7]; and Thomson v. Dyment[8] which are ample authority for the proposition. It follows that unless we are able to say that it is sufficiently proved that there existed some mercantile usage to the contrary warranting us in superadding to the contract by implication a term providing for an inspection at the appellants\u2019 mills at Campbellford the respondents are entitled to recover damages for the breach of the contract of sale. Such an addition to the agreement of the parties may, no doubt, if sufficiently proved, be engrafted on it by parol evidence of the custom.\nThe case is thus narrowed to a question of evidence. Is it sufficiently proved that there existed a usage of trade controlling the prim\u00e2 facie effect of the contract as expressed in the written agreement of the parties, by importing into it by implication an additional term? I am of opinion that no such usage is proved. The evidence entirely fails to establish it. The Canadian wool merchants called to prove a custom such as the appellants contend for have not shown that any such general custom exists even with regard to contracts made in Canada. What these dealers, four witnesses, two from Montreal, one from Toronto, and one from Hamilton speak of, is not a general usage or course of practice universally governing the trade but of the course pursued by them in their own business. Such evidence is of course insufficient to establish a universal custom of trade and must be regarded as irrelevant. For the same reason the evidence of Mr. Breckenridge, the manager of a woollen mill at Carleton Place, and of Mr. Owen, the appellants\u2019 own manager, is insufficient to establish anything like a general usage of trade. Then the existence of any universal custom in Canada is negatived by the two witnesses called by the respondents, Mr. Rosamond and Mr. Kendry, whose evidence must be deemed conclusive on this point. The authorities establish that in order to engraft a new term in a mercantile contract by evidence of this kind a general course of dealing must be shown to exist, and that isolated instances of the way in which particular parties carry on their business is inadmissible.\nEven if it had been established by sufficient evidence that such a mercantile custom as is contended for prevailed generally in the wool trade in Canada that could not possibly affect the respondents, New York merchants selling goods in the New York market and not shown to be cognizant of any such Canadian usage as the appellant contend for. The passage from the judgment of the Privy Council in Kirchner v. Venus[9] quoted in the respondents\u2019 factum is so apposite that, being as it is binding upon us as a conclusive authority, I transcribe it here.\nThe ground upon which it appears to us that this case must be decided in favour of the appellants is this, that when evidence of usage of a particular place is admitted to add to or in any manner affect the construction of a written contract, it is admitted only on the ground that the parties who made the contract are both cognizant of the usage and must be presumed to have made their contract with reference to it. But no such presumption can arise when one of the parties is ignorant of it. In this case the indorsees of the bills of lading were evidently not in Liverpool bat in Sydney, and though they may be agents of persons residing in London, there is no evidence that these gentlemen were acquainted with the alleged usage in Liverpool.\nThe additional authorities referred to by the respondents, Bartlett v. Pentland[10]; Pearson v. Scott[11]; Bayliffe v. Butterworth[12]; Pollock v. Stables[13]; Greaves v. Legg[14]; Addison on Contracts[15]; are all to the same effect.\nIn the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants, as well as in the factum presented on their behalf, much reliance was placed on the argument ab inconvenienti. It was said that the inconvenience of inspecting at New York would be so great, and the presumption of a contrary practice consequently so strong, that it requires but little evidence to establish the usage contended for. This argument is sufficiently met by what has been already demonstrated, namely, that in the absence of sufficient legal evidence of a usage one is not to be inferred from circumstances for the purpose of altering the terms expressed by the parties in their written contract. But so far from the weight of the argument from inconvenience being in favour of the appellants it is, in my opinion, strongly in favour of the respondents. To say that a New York merchant entering into a contract for the sale of goods at New York, calling for delivery there, is to be either bound to send the goods to Canada, and also an agent to be present at an inspection, in order to ascertain if the goods correspond with the sample, or to submit to an ex parte inspection there, before being paid the price, would be to introduce into contracts a condition so unreasonable and inconvenient as seriously to interfere with the conduct of business, and would inevitably lead to the insertion in contracts of special clauses excluding the operation of such a usage. On the other hand there would be no inconvenience in an examination of the goods at New York. The objection that the wool could not be examined in the bonded warehouse at New York entirely fails, for it is plain upon the evidence that if it should have been found necessary to open the bales that could have been done at comparatively small expense by changing the entry from one for direct export to Canada into an ordinary bonded warehouse entry according to the United States customs regulations, upon which a permit could be obtained for a thorough examination of the goods so held.\nThe respondent in his factum takes the objection that this was not a sale by sample at all. I incline to think that this objection is well founded. I do not, however, express any decided opinion upon it, for I desire to place my judgment upon the same grounds as those on which the judgments of the Chief Justice and the Chancellor proceeded, and upon the hypothesis assumed by the appellants that this was a sale by sample.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clute & William.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 20 Ont.

By the result of the election plaintiff lost his wager and the money was paid by defendant to Richards after notice given by plaintiff claiming a return of the money and plaintiff brought an action to recover his share of the amount deposited with defendant on the ground that the betting was illegal and the contract to pay the money to Richards consequently void. The question for decision was whether or not the stakeholder was guilty of a misdemeanour under R.S.C. ch. 159 sec. 9, and if he was, whether or not the plaintiff was an accessory to the offence under ch. 145; if a misdemeanour was committed to which plaintiff was accessory he could not recover.\nThe trial judge, the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal all held that plaintiff could recover following Reg. v.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming that of the Common Pleas Division, which in turn upheld the decision of Mr. Justice Street, the trial judge. The action was brought by the respondent against the appellant to recover $500, the amount of a deposit which had been paid to the appellant as a stakeholder under the following circumstances. Just before a general election for the House of Commons, on the 23rd February, 1892, the respondent and one John R. Richards made a wager on the result of the election for the electoral district of the city of London, for which John Carling and Charles Hyman were candidates, each party betting $500, Richards betting that Carling would be gazetted as the member elected, and the respondent betting that Hyman would be so gazetted. The bet was reduced to writing and each party deposited $500 in the hands of the appellant as a stakeholder. Subsequently and after the election, on the 29th February, 1892, the respondent gave the appellant a written notice claiming a return of his deposit and directing him not to pay over the money to Richards, and this notice was repeated by one from the respondent\u2019s solicitor on the 4th March, 1892. Notwithstanding this the appellant did pay over the money to Richards (whose candidate, Carling, had been gazetted) taking from him a bond of indemnity. The respondent then brought the present action in all the stages of which he has been successful. But one of the learned judges who have dealt with the case in the several courts through which it has passed has taken the view contended for by the present appellant. In the Court of Appeal the Chancellor of Ontario differed from the other three members of the court. The same result was also arrived at in a similar action of Trebilcock v. Gustin, in which the present respondent was plaintiff, and which came before the Queen\u2019s Bench Division.\nThere was no difference between the parties as to the facts. The respondent\u2019s right to recover depends entirely on a question of law. There can be no doubt that a wager on the result of a Parliamentary election is at common law a contract forbidden by public policy, and in that sense illegal. This is shown by the case of Allen v. Hearn[11]. It may also be within the prohibition contained in section 131 of the Election Act, although that section, as I had occasion to point out in the North Perth Election Case[12], has a much wider scope and is not confined to aleatory contracts like wagers. This question of the legality or illegality of the wager, or whether the illegality depends on common law or statute, is of no importance in the present case. The authorities show most conclusively that whether a wager be legal or illegal either of the parties to it may withdraw his deposit or stake from the hands of a stakeholder at any time before the latter has paid it over. We have no statute such as the Imperial statute 8 & 9 Vict. ch. 110, which was in question in the cases of Hampden v. Walsh[13]; Batson v. Newman[14]; Diggle v. Higgs[15]; and Trimble v. Hill[16]. It was held in these cases that the common law had not been altered in this respect by the statute, and that the law remained as it had been settled by the cases of Lacaussade v. White[17]; Eltham v. Kingsman[18]; and Hastelow v. Jackson[19].\nIn Hampden v. Walsh13, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn thus states the law:\u2014 A distinction has, however, been taken between cases in which the deposit was made to abide the event of an illegal wager and others in which the wager not being prohibited by statute, or of an improper character, was legally binding. In the former cases, the contract between the principals being null and void, the money remains in the hands of the stakeholder devoid of any trust in respect of the other party, and in trust only for the party depositing who can at any time claim it back before it has been paid over. In the latter the contract, prior to 8 & 9 Vict. c. 109, s. 18, not being invalid it was open to contention that money deposited on the wager with a stakeholder must remain with the latter to abide the event.\nGreater difficulty, therefore, presented itself where, prior to the 8 & 9 Vict. c. 109, s. 18, money was deposited on a wager not illegal, and the Courts of King\u2019s Bench and Exchequer were at variance on this point. In Eltham v. Kingsman[20] the Court of King\u2019s Bench, consisting of Lord Ellenborough C.J., Bayley, Abbott and Holroyd JJ., held that even where a wager was legal the authority of a stakeholder, who was also (as is the case of the present defendant) to decide between the parties, might be revoked and the deposit demanded back. \u201cHere\u201d says Lord Ellenborough, \u201cbefore there has been a decision the party has countermanded the authority of the stakeholder.\u201d \u201cA man\u201d says Abbott J. \u201cwho has made a foolish wager may rescind it before any decision has taken place.\u201d In the later case of Emery v. Richards[21], the Court of Exchequer, where money had been deposited on a wager of less than \u00a310, on a foot race, and therefore, prior to the passing of the statute 8 & 9 Vict. not illegal under the then existing statute, held that the plaintiff could not demand to have his stake returned, but must abide the event. The case of Eltham v. Kingsman20 does not, however, appear to have been brought to the notice of the court, and in our view the decision of this court was the sounder one. We cannot concur in what is said in Chitty on contracts, 8th ed. p. 574, that \u201ca stakeholder is the agent of both parties, or rather their trustee.\u201d It may be true that he is the trustee of both parties in a certain sense, so that if the event comes off and the authority to pay over the money by the depositor be not revoked, he may be bound to pay it over. But primarily he is the agent of the depositor, and can deal with the money deposited so long only as his authority subsists. Such was evidently the view taken of the position of a stakeholder by this court in the two cases of Eltham v. Kingsman20 and Hastelow v. Jackson[22], and in that view we concur.\nThis case was followed and the law as laid down by Cockburn C.J. adopted in the before cited cases of Trimble v. Hill[23], Batson v. Newman[24] and Diggle v. Higgs[25], and in the two last of these cases, as well as in Hastelow v. Jackson[26] and Hampden v. Walsh[27], the notice of withdrawal was not given to the stakeholder until after determination of the event. There can therefore be no doubt of the respondent\u2019s right to recover if the law had depended altogether upon these authorities.\nCertain statutory provisions peculiar to the legislation of the Dominion, not avoiding the wager, but making, as it is contended, the depositing in the hands of the stakeholder for the purpose of the wager by itself an illegal act, are relied on by the appellant as disentitling the respondent to recover back his money.\nBy Revised Statutes (Canada) chap. 159, subsec. (c), sec. 9, it is enacted that:\n(1) Every one who * * *.becomes the custodian or depositary of any money, property or valuable thing, staked, wagered or pledged * * * upon the result of any political or municipal election, or of any race, or of any contest or trial of skill or endurance of man or beast is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one year.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall apply to any person by reason of his becoming the custodian or depositary of any money, property or valuable thing staked to be paid to the winner of any lawful race * * * or to bets between individuals.\nBy Revised Statutes (Canada), chap. 145, sec. 7, it was enacted:\nThat every one who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any misdemeanour, whether the same is a misdemeanour at common law or by virtue of any act, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.\nSection 9 of chapter 159 has with a very slight addition been carried into the Criminal Code 1892, of which it now forms the 204th section. Section 7 of chapter 145 has not been adopted textually in the Code, but the act it declares a misdemeanour is now included and made a substantive offence by section 61 of the Code. The Code did not, however, come into force until the first of July, 1893, and we must therefore have regard only to the provisions of the Revised Statutes.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention is that the first mentioned statute makes the mere receipt of the deposit or stake to abide the event of the bet a misdemeanour on the part of the stakeholder who becomes the depositary of it and that chapter 145 section 7 also made the party to the wager who deposited the money for the purpose of it guilty of a misdemeanour as a party aiding, abetting and procuring the commission of a misdemeanour. The respondent insists that this being a \u201cbet between individuals\u201d section 9 of chapter 159 has no application inasmuch as the effect of those words in the concluding clause of that section is to save from the operation of the statute, not only \u201cbets between individuals\u201d but also deposits made for the purpose of such bets.\nTwo points which have not been seriously disputed may be disposed of at once. First, if the proper construction of section 9 is that which the appellant contends for and the depositary of such a bet as the parties made in the present instance on the result of a political election is guilty of a misdemeanour, there can be no doubt that the party to the wager who deposits the stake is within the definition of one who aids and abets or procures the commission of a misdemeanour within the 7th section of chapter 145. It follows that in such case the respondent would, by reason of his complicity in the unlawful act of taking the money on deposit, be in pari delicto with the appellant, and if such was the respondent\u2019s position the law is clear that he cannot recover money so deposited. The authorities show decisively that when money is paid for an illegal purpose which when consummated would put the party paying and the party receiving it in pari delicto there is locus p\u0153nitenti\u0153 open to the party paying so long as the illegal purpose has not been carried out. But where both parties are equally wrong, and the mere payment of the money (as to the stakeholder in the present case) constitutes the illegal act, there can be no withdrawal, and the money cannot be recovered back. This is so clearly the law that it is hardly necessary to cite cases to maintain the proposition. I will, however, refer to one or two of the latest authorities. In Scott v. Brown[28] Lord Justice Lindley says:\nEx turpi caus\u00e2 non oritur actio. This old and well known legal maxim is founded on good sense, and expresses a clear and well recognized legal principle which is not confined to indictable offences. No court ought to enforce an illegal contract or allow itself to be made the instrument of enforcing obligations alleged to arise out of a contract or transaction which is illegal, if the illegality is duly brought to the notice of the court, and if the person invoking the aid of the court is himself implicated in the illegality. It matters not whether the defendant has pleaded the illegality or whether he has not. If the evidence adduced by the plaintiff proves the illegality the court ought not to assist him. If authority is wanted for this proposition it will be found in the well-known judgment of Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson[29].\nIn Herman v. Jeuchner[30] the case was that a man procured another to go bail for him on depositing in the hands of the surety the amount of the bail by way of indemnity in case of default. This was of course illegal, being in contravention of the Statute of Bailbonds, 23 Hy. 6 ch. 9. The principal sued the bail to recover the money alleging the illegality and insisting that the illegal purpose had not been carried out. The Court of Appeal held that the payment of the money to the surety was itself an illegal act. In Kearley v. Thomson[31] the illegal purpose had only partly been consummated, yet it was held that the money paid for the illegal purpose could not be recovered back. In Taylor v. Bowers[32] the Court of Appeal say:\nIf money is paid or goods delivered for an illegal purpose, the person who had so paid the money or delivered the goods may recover them back before the illegal purpose is carried out; but if he waits till the illegal purpose is carried out, or if he seeks to enforce the illegal transaction, in neither case can he maintain an action.\nAnd it is worthy of remark that so far from the courts evincing any disposition to relax the law on this head we find the Court of Appeal in Kearley v. Thomson[33] saying that:\nThe application of the principle laid down in Taylor v. Bowers32 and even the principle itself may at some time hereafter require consideration, if not in this court, yet in a higher tribunal.\nNext, we come to what is really the single substantial question in the case, that on which the judgments of all the courts below have proceeded, the proper construction of the 9th section of chapter 159 of the Revised Statutes. If we read the first part of this section 9 apart from the proviso contained in sub-section 2, I cannot conceive any one having a reasonable doubt of its application to the present appellant as the custodian or depositary of money staked and wagered upon the result of a political election. These are the very words of the statute. Surely the appellant received the money now sought to be recovered as a custodian or depositary of it as money which had been staked and wagered by the respondent with Richards on the result of the London Parliamentary Election. The case comes, therefore, within the exact and literal terms of the enactment. Its plain construction according to the language used (reading it of course without the proviso) involves no absurdity, no inconsistency, and does not bring it into collision with any other provisions of the statute. Construing it thus according to the plain meaning of the words it is, in my opinion, a most salutary enactment, and one which would be effectual in stopping the evil practice of betting on elections. To any one who would doubt this I would say the very case before us shows that this would be the beneficial consequence of a strict construction of the statute. The actual bet now in question never would have been made without putting up the money, and the money never would have been put up if it could have been foreseen that neither the winning gamester nor the party depositing could have made the stakeholder pay it over[34].\nIt is argued, however, that the second subsection of chapter 9 in saying that the penal clauses shall not apply to \u201cbets between individuals\u201d makes the whole statute inapplicable to a deposit made for the purpose of a bet or wager such as this on a parliamentary election, because such wager was made between \u201cindividuals.\u201d I am not able to read the words of the proviso in this way. Prim\u00e2 facie they mean that the section shall not apply to a bet or wager, not that they shall not apply to the case of a deposit made for the purpose of a bet or wager. It is said, however, that we are to construe these words as equivalent in meaning to the words \u201cany money deposited for the purpose of a bet between individuals.\u201d I know of no principle upon which we are entitled so to alter the prim\u00e2 facie meaning of the words in which the intent of the legislature is expressed by adding other words, at least under such conditions as we have here. The words of exception as they stand are perfectly intelligible. They apply to bets only, not to deposits. The legislature says, in effect, nothing which has been said in the preceding part of the section, making a deposit of money illegal and punishable, shall apply to the bets in respect of which such deposit has been made if such bets are between individuals. There is nothing absurd or even inconsequential in this. It may well be that it was considered by Parliament that making the deposit of money an illegal act, without extending the prohibition to the bets themselves, would be an effectual way of putting down the evil the act was aimed at; but whether it would or would not have that effect is not the question; it is sufficient that the words have in their primary signification a plain obvious meaning which leads to no illegal or absurd result, and is controlled by no context requiring us to apply to them an extended or secondary meaning. The well known \u201cgolden rule\u201d so often referred to in the judgments of Lord Wensleydale[35] and originally propounded by Mr. Justice Burton in the case of Warburton v. Loveland[36] therefore requires us to give the language used its plain ordinary meaning. The courts have sometimes construed the words used in statutes not according to their strict grammatical and ordinary signification, but as elliptical modes of expression used as symbols for some secondary meaning. This was the case of Robertson v. Day[37] where the Privy Council adopted this mode of construction. But this was expressly referred to the principle that the context called for such an interpretation. Here, as I have said, I can find no such context, for I cannot find that there is pervading the statute any general intent to confine it to pool selling or pool-rooms, which is the reason ascribed for enlarging the actual words \u201cbets between individuals\u201d so as to include deposits for the purpose of such bets. If the legislature had indicated an intention to confine this provision of the act to pool-rooms and pool selling it would, of course, be the duty of the courts to obey their mandate, but it must be observed that the statute in that case so far as applicable to bets on elections would have been useless; it would not have struck at the mode in which such bets are usually made, and would moreover be palpably open to evasion. I cannot agree that we are to add words which would manifestly have the effect of producing such a result. Moreover the statute was a remedial one; construing it literally it was intended as a remedy designed for the public benefit to suppress the evil practice of depositing money for the purposes of bets at elections. It ought, therefore, to receive a beneficial construction which in this instance accords with the strict grammatical construction. If there had been in the enactment itself any indication that it was to be restricted to deposits made at particular places, or with persons belonging to particular classes such as pool sellers, or professional gamblers, it would have been different, but as I have said there is no indication of any such intent in the statute. Betting on elections between individuals may be considered a great evil, but if the legislature did not think fit to inflict a penalty for that their omission to do so is no reason why we should hold that they did not intend to suppress another attendant evil, when they have in so many words said that they did so intend.\nI regret that I should be compelled to differ from so many learned judges for whose opinions I have a most sincere respect, but I can find no answer to the argument on which the Chancellor has based his judgment. Since writing the above I have read the judgments delivered in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in the case of Trebilcock v. Gustin, not yet reported. The learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench rests his judgment in that case on the principle that the appellant, a stakeholder, is estopped from disputing the right of his bailor, the person who has deposited the money with him, to withdraw it. I entirely agree that this would be so if there had been no illegality in the act of depositing itself. But if I have successfully demonstrated, as I have to my own satisfaction, that the mere making of the deposit was in itself made by the statute an unlawful act, then, for a reason of public policy which makes the resulting rule altogether paramount to any estoppel operating as between the parties, an illegal act having been consummated, the depositor cannot recover back his stake.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs to the appellant in all the courts below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, for the reasons given in the judgment of the Chief Justice which I have read.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The defendant, appellant, has, in my opinion, entirely failed to impeach or weaken in any way the cogent reasoning of the learned judges who formed the majority in the court appealed from. Chief Justice Armour\u2019s opinion in the analogous case of Trebilcock v. Gustin also clearly demonstrates, in my opinion, the unsoundness of the defendant\u2019s contentions.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an action brought by the respondent against the appellant to recover five hundred dollars deposited in the month of February, 1892, with the appellant to abide the event of a wager. The wager was in writing as follows:\nMr. F.T. Trebilcock [the respondent] bets Mr. J.E. Richards ($500) five hundred dollars, that C.S. Hyman is the gazetted Member of Parliament for the city of London at the coming election for the Dominion House to take place on Friday, the 26th day of February, 1892.\n(Signed,) FRED. T. TREBILCOCK.\n(Signed,) JOHN E. RICHARDS.\nAfter the election the respondent demanded from the appellant the $1,000 deposited with him, and subsequently demanded from him the sum of $500 deposited by him with the appellant.\nAfter the gazetting of the member for the city of London (Sir John Carling, the opponent of Mr. Hyman, having been declared elected) the appellant paid over the whole money to Richards.\nThe action was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Street, sitting without a jury, who directed judgment to be entered for the respondent for the sum of $500 deposited by him with the appellant, with interest and costs.\nThe appellant then appealed to the Common Pleas Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice, and subsequently to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, both appeals being dismissed, Mr. Chancellor Boyd, sitting as a member of the Court of Appeal, dissenting.\nThe appeal is now from the judgment of that court.\nThe only questions involved are, first, the proper construction to be given to cap. 159 R.S.C. sec. 9, and cap. 145 R.S.C. sec. 7, and secondly, the effect of these statutes upon the transaction.\nNow, I propose to construe this statute cap. 159 sec. 9 according to its plain and obvious meaning. I do not care what the intention of Parliament was in passing it if that intention has not been given effect to by the language used. The words themselves must govern. These words so far as they affect this case are as follows:\nEvery one who * * * (c) becomes the custodian or depositary of any money, property or valuable thing staked, wagered or pledged * * upon the result of any political or municipal election * * is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one year.\nNow the appellant Walsh became the custodian of $1,000 staked upon the result of the London election, a political election. Was that a misdemeanour under the statute? The majority of the Court of Appeal have said no, that the object Parliament had in view was to restrain the abuse to which gambling and betting leads where betting houses or places for recording or registering bets or wagers or selling pools are kept in which money may be staked or deposited in advance or otherwise by all comers, or in which other forms of gambling upon the result of a race or election or other event are facilitated, but that it leaves untouched the stakeholder or depositary of moneys casually bet upon a political election as not being within the mischief of the act; and they rely upon subsection 2, viz.: \u201cnothing in this section shall apply to * * bets between individuals\u201d as conclusively showing that such was the object of the legislation.\nNow, if the words of the section are to be any guide as to the legislative intention they show that instead of proposing to deal with two the legislature intended to deal with four practices supposed to be detrimental to public welfare, describing each practice in a separate sub\u2011clause. These are (a) the use of premises for registering bets and selling pools; (b) the use of apparatus for these purposes; (c) the holding of stakes in connection with election bets and bets upon illegal matches of any kind; and lastly (d) the registration of such bets. I cannot here see the slightest indication on the part of the legislature that the two last mentioned practices were limited by the question of place; that they might lawfully be exercised on the street but became indictable offences when indulged in within the threshold of the betting house; that their criminal character was to be determined by the matter of a road line.\nNeither is there any indication that the holding of moneys bet upon elections was, in the conscience of Parliament, less injurious to public morals than the keeping of betting houses or the possession of gambling apparatus. The same sanction is prescribed in each case; the same penal consequences ensue. In the legislative eye they are equal mischiefs. Then as to the exception in subsec. 2 above set out; it is clear that the main section does not attempt to make betting of itself a misdemeanour, not even betting upon political or municipal elections. Betting in any shape or form may be, I believe it is, a mischief; its tendency from first to last is opposed to the greatest good of society; but as a sensible legislature never attempts to suppress even an admitted evil unless there is a fair chance that with the nation\u2019s help the attempt will succeed, it did not in the present instance make betting pure and simple, a mere exchange of words between individuals, a criminal offence. But the keeping of betting houses, the public selling of pools, the possession and working of gambling apparatus, the registration in books kept for the special purpose of wagering transactions, and the actual receiving and possessing of money or other property as a stake upon political or other illegal bets, were overt acts, admittedly mischievous but at the same time susceptible of easy proof, and therefore they one and all were made illegal. The excepting statement as to bets between individuals was a declaration by the legislature (it may have been an unnecessary statement) that in this particular act it was not attempting to deal with betting per se, but only with these concomitants of betting specified in the main section.\nSo far I am discussing whether the appellant Walsh, the stakeholder, was chargeable with the statutory offence. In any event I do not see how the excepting clause assists him. He made no bet, but he did an act which certainly within the letter, and I believe within the spirit and intention, of the act was expressly declared to be a misdemeanour.\nAnd I am strongly confirmed in this view by a consideration of the analogous Imperial act, 16 & 17 Vict. ch. 199, the provisions of which I doubt not were present to our own Parliament when passing this act. In that act it is manifest that the practices dealt with were acts done in particular places. From the fact that in our act place is not made by express words material as regards the offences specified in c and d, we are justified in assuming that the question of place was immaterial.\nThen as to the construction of sec. 7 of chap. 145:\nEvery one who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any misdemeanour whether the same is a misdemeanour at common law or by virtue of any act is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.\nNow the making of a bet is one thing, the recording or registration of a bet is another thing and the depositing in the hands of a stake-holder of the amount bet is again another thing. I admit that under the statute the bet itself was not proscribed; whether the committing to writing of the terms of the bet was a recording or registration of the bet, and consequently a misdemeanour, we are not called upon in this case to decide. I am of opinion, at all events, that it was a misdemeanour on the part of Walsh to act as stake- holder of the money. His offence, his only offence, was the taking of the money. Was not the giving of the money to him by the respondent Trebilcock, knowing as he did the purpose of the deposit, an aiding or counselling or procuring of the stake-holder\u2019s taking? In my view of this there can be no doubt and therefore Trebilcock was a misdemeanant liable to punishment as a principal offender.\nThe final inquiry then is: Trebilcock having paid the stake in question, having committed an indictable offence and (we may assume for the purpose of argument having, upon conviction, undergone a year\u2019s imprisonment and paid a fine of $1,000,) can he now recover from the stake-holder the $500 wager? (It is quite immaterial that he may have lost his bet and that Richards under the code d\u2019honneur was entitled to the $1,000).\nNow I agree that apart from the statutes referred to the respondent was entitled to recover and the decision of the courts below was right.\nIn Roscoe\u2019s nisi prius, 16th edition, page 590, the law is summed up as follows:\nWhere money has been paid in pursuance of an illegal contract it is generally irrecoverable.\nCertain exceptions are, however, given as follows:\nBut in some cases it is recoverable as money had and received to the use of party paying it; e.g. 1. Where the contract remains executory though the plaintiff and defendant be in pari delicto as a deposit upon an illegal wager. Where the plaintiff authorized his money to be applied to an illegal purpose he may recover it before it has been paid over or applied to such purpose. 2. Money is recoverable from a stake-holder in whose hands it has been placed upon an illegal consideration though executed by the happening of the event upon which a wager is made, provided the money has not been paid over by the stake-holder to the other party, or was paid over after notice to the contrary. And this statement of the law is fully borne out by the very recent case of Barclay v. Pearson[38] where the cases of Hasletow v. Jackson[39] and Hodson v. Terrill[40] are reviewed and followed, and the law as above stated by Roscoe is approved.\nIt will be observed that in this extract from Roscoe, as well as in Barclay v. Pearson38, the phrases \u201cillegal contract,\u201d \u201cillegal purpose,\u201d \u201cillegal consideration,\u201d are used, and that the right to recover from a stake-holder is treated as an exception to the general rule that \u201cmoney paid in pursuance of an illegal contract is generally irrecoverable.\u201d The word \u201cillegal\u201d has more than one meaning; a contract may be voidable and in that sense illegal at the option of only one of the parties to it; he may take advantage of its illegality although the other party may not; a contract may be illegal because solely upon grounds of public policy the courts will refuse to enforce it, no further penal consequences resulting; and a contract may be illegal because Parliament has enacted that the entering into it is a criminal offence, subjecting the parties to punishment in consequence of their having made it. Is there any distinction between these different kinds of illegality? The general principle is illustrated by Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson[41].\nBut courts will aid a party, as the cases cited show, where having only contemplated an illegal act and paid money to an agent (as in the case of an unenforceable bet) in furtherance of it he has, before anything further is done, before any offence is actually committed, done all things necessary to reinstate himself.\nBut where a plaintiff has actually crossed the line and committed an offence against the criminal law is there then a place for repentance? I am inclined to think there is not.\nPollock in laying down the general rule says:\nMoney paid or property delivered under an unlawful agreement cannot be recovered back unless nothing has been done in the execution of the unlawful purpose beyond the payment or delivery itself (and the agreement is not positively criminal or immoral).\nIn Tappenden v. Randall[42] where the exception above referred to is established, it is intimated that it probably would not be allowed if the agreement were actually criminal or immoral; in that case Heath J. says:\nUndoubtedly there may be cases where the contract may be of a nature too grossly immoral for the court to enter into any discussion of it, as where one man has paid money by way of hire to another to murder a third person. But when nothing of that kind occurs I think there ought to be a locus p\u0153nitenti\u0153, and that a party should not be compelled against his will to adhere to the contract.\nI pass by numerous cases since; Pearce v. Brooks[43]; Rex v. Dr. Berenger[44]; Reg. v. Aspinall[45]; and refer particularly to Scott v. Brown[46] decided by the court of Appeal in August last, where the court refused to enforce a contract held to be an illegal transaction and subjecting the parties to indictment for conspiracy.\nIn the present case, as already stated, the plaintiff had not only proposed the committing of an indictable offence\u2014if that had been all the locus p\u0153nitenti\u0153 would have still been open\u2014but had carried his proposition into effect, had committed a criminal act\u2014had by the simple act of paying the stake-holder the money aided and abetted him in becoming in the words of the statute \u201cthe custodian of money staked upon the result of apolitical election,\u201d the result being that both are in pari delicto, both are amenable to the criminal law and neither can avail himself of the civil courts for redress. In my judgment the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts below.\nKING J.

McLeish[3]; Campbell v. McGregor[4].\nRobinson Q.C. and Aylesworth Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant brings this action in the character of a judgment creditor of the defendant Peter Lillico in respect of a judgment recovered in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in the Province of Manitoba, having obtained a charge upon certain lands of the judgment debtor situate in that province by registering his judgment pursuant to the provisions of a provincial statute. The appellant alleges that the respondents, the Bank of Hamilton, are mortgagees of Lillico of the same lands under a registered mortgage in respect of which they are entitled to priority over the appellant and he accordingly seeks to redeem the bank. In the last aspect of the case there was no dispute as to the facts. The cause was tried before the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division who dismissed the action. From this judgment there was an appeal to the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench by which court the original judgment was reversed and a judgment was pronounced whereby the appellant was declared to be entitled to redeem the respondents, the Bank of Hamilton, and an account was directed to be taken by the master of what was due on the mortgages to the bank, upon payment of which the bank was directed to convey the mortgaged lands to the appellant. No provision was, however, made by this judgment for the event of the appellant failing to redeem, the usual direction that in such event the action should be dismissed not being contained in the judgment but being, as it would appear, advisedly omitted. Neither was any provision made for raising the appellant\u2019s charge by a sale of the lands in the case of redemption by him.\nThe statute of Manitoba under which the judgment was registered provides that the effect of registering a judgment upon the lands within the limits of the registry office in which the registration takes place shall be as follows:\u2014\nFrom the time of the recording of the same the said judgment shall bind and form a lien and charge on all the estate and interest aforesaid in the lands of the judgment defendant in the several registration divisions in the registry offices of which such certificate is recorded, the same as though charged in writing by the defendant under his hand and seal.\nThis enactment is manifestly copied from the English statute 1 & 2 Vict. chap. 110, sec. 13.\nThe question presented for the decision of the Court of Appeal was whether the appellant, having no locus standi in curi\u00e2 except such as this statutory charge conferred, was entitled to enforce it against the Manitoba lands in the Ontario courts and this question the Court of Appeal have answered in the negative.\nIt is important to distinguish between the judgment and the charge or lien created by the statute. This is not an action upon the judgment but one to enforce the statutory charge. The appellant\u2019s claim does not in any respect involve relief in respect of any personal obligation, either against the bank or against Lillico, the judgment debtor. The charge created by the statute is exclusively a real right affecting the lands, unaccompanied by any personal liability, and it creates no equity enforceable in personam against any one. When law and equity were administered by separate courts, courts of equity held that where personal equities existed between parties over whom they had jurisdiction, though such equities might have reference to lands situate without the jurisdiction, they would give relief by a decree operating not directly upon the lands but strictly in personam. The well known case of Penn v. Lord Baltimore[5] was a case of this kind, and on a similar principle relief was given against a defendant within the jurisdiction by decreeing foreclosure in default of redemption of mortgages of foreign lands. But in all such cases there was some personal obligation in the nature of a trust or other equity which the court enforced, as it was said, by affecting the conscience of the party against whom it decreed relief. This indirect mode of affecting lands over which the court could not properly have any direct judicial authority was, however, confined to the class of cases mentioned, and was never extended so far as to give direct relief in respect of charges on lands by decreeing a sale in the nature of an equitable execution, or the raising of a bare charge such as the statute has conferred on the appellant in the present case. Such decrees would have been unenforceable in the foreign jurisdiction and might have brought the courts decreeing them into collision with the forum within whose local jurisdiction the lands were situated.\nThe only locus standi which the appellant in this appeal has is to have direct relief against the land by means of a sale, for we know that in such cases as these the courts of the Province of Manitoba restrict the relief which they give to a sale of the lands. All analogy is therefore against the appellant\u2019s contention and although no case precisely in point can be produced yet the case of Norris v. Chambres[6], referred to by Mr. Justice Osler in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, is so like the present in the principles involved that without disregarding that authority, decided in the first instance by Lord Romilly, M.R., and affirmed on re-hearing by Lord Campbell, Chancellor, we could not do otherwise than dismiss this appeal. Norris v. Chambres6 was a case in which it was sought to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien against real property out of the jurisdiction, and the observations of the Master of the Rolls apply a fortiori to such a case as the present. I also refer to the cases of Re Hawthorne[7]; and Harrison v. Harrison[8]. In Norris v. Chambres[9] Lord Campbell in giving judgment says:\nI think that, upon the authority of Penn v. Lord Baltimore[10], which has often been acted upon, the plaintiff would have been entitled to succeed if he could have proved that the claim for a declaration of the proposed lien or charge on the mine was founded on any contract or privity between him or the deceased John Sadlier and the defendants, the purchasers of the mine. * * * But I agree in thinking, with the Master of the Rolls, that the plaintiff has failed to show any such contract or privity. Upon the evidence adduced the purchasers of the mine whom he sues, are to be considered as mere strangers, and any notice which they may have had of transactions between Sadlier and the Company (which has now ceased to exist) cannot give this court jurisdiction to declare the proposed lien or charge on lands in a foreign country. An English court ought not to pronounce a decree even in personam which can have no specific operation without the intervention of a foreign court, and which, in the country where the lands to be charged by it lie, would probably be treated as brutum fulmen.\nWharton in his treatise on the Conflict of Laws[11] says:\u2014 It has already been stated that all interests in land, whether consisting of equitable interests, charges, trusts, or servitudes, all interests, in other words, that may fall under the term lien in its most general sense, are controlled by the lex rei sit\u0153 even in the opinion of those who would confine that law within the narrowest limit. * * * The only way by which title can be made to such liens, or the only process by which such liens can be enforced, is that of the situs.\nMr. Justice Story, who was more liberal than other commentators in relaxing the strict rule of the lex rei sit\u0153, thus states his views[12]:\nNot only lands and houses, but servitudes and easements, and other charges on lands, as mortgages and rents, and trust estates are deemed to be, in the sense of law, immovables and governed by the lex rei sit\u0153.\nWhat I take to be the result of these and other cases is well summarised by a modern text writer as follows:[13]\nAll questions as to the burdens and liabilities of immoveable estate situate in a foreign country depend, in the absence of any trust or contractual obligation, simply upon the law of the country where the real estate exists; wherefore if the contested claim is based upon the right to land, and must be determined by the lex loci rei sit\u0153, and the only ground for instituting proceedings in this country is that the defendants are resident here, the courts of this country have no jurisdiction.\nIt may be said that the relief which the appellant seeks, and that which has been accorded to him by the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, is a mere decree or judgment in personam against the Bank of Hamilton. The answer to this is, however, that the right of the appellant is one limited to enforcing a direct charge on the lands, and that the redemption of the bank is merely ancillary to this, for even if we hold the appellant entitled to judgment we could not allow that pronounced by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to stand unaltered. That is a mere partial and fragmentary judgment, which, if it related to property within the jurisdiction, would for that reason alone be defective for not having gone on to direct ulterior relief by a sale of the land. That a judgment if one were pronounced for the sale of the lands could not be fully carried out without the aid of the courts of the situs is apparent, if we bear in mind that Lillico, the judgment debtor, is without both jurisdictions, and that the title of a purchaser could not be perfected without either a conveyance from him or a vesting order which the Manitoba courts alone would have jurisdiction to grant and enforce.\nThe tendency of modern decisions has been to decline jurisdiction with reference to foreign land, and when we consider that if the arguments invoked for the present appellant were to prevail we might be asked to uphold a judgment of a Quebec court in an hypothecary action respecting lands in Ontario, or vice vers\u00e2 a judgment in an action in the Ontario courts directing a sale of hypothecated immovables in the Province of Quebec, the convenience, good sense and sound jurisprudence of the rules laid down in the later English authorities, which have now culminated in the decision of the House of Lords in the case of the British South Africa Co. v. The Companhia de Mo\u00e7amhique[14], become at once apparent. It is unnecessary to write more fully, as Mr. Justice Osler in his very able judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal, and which proceeds on the same ratio decidendi as the judgment of this court, has fully expounded the principles upon which it must be held that the Ontario courts have no jurisdiction to entertain this action.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Mabee & Gearing.\nSolicitors for respondents: Scott, Lees & Hobson.\n[1] 20 Ont.

C. which was collected by the School Commissioners of the City of Three Rivers, while she was employed by them. At the time of the action the plaintiff had ceased to be in their employ. The Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed the action.\nOn a motion to the Supreme Court of Canada to allow bond in appeal, the same having been refused by a judge of the court below, the Registrar of the Supreme Court and a Judge in Chambers, on the ground that the case was not appealable:\nHeld, that the matter in controversy did not relate to any office or fee of office within the meaning of sec. 29 (b) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C. c. 135.\n2.

This was a motion by way of appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Taschereau confirming the ruling of the registrar in chambers on an application made by the appellant.\nThe facts and proceedings in the case are as follows:\nOn the 22nd August, 1871, the defendants engaged the plaintiff as teacher of a separate girl's school in school district no. 4 of the city of Three Rivers. The resolution adopted by the defendants on the subject was to the effect that the plaintiff should keep the said school at the same salary and upon the same conditions as the Reverend Sisters of Providence, who taught it before her. This was for a salary of $144 a year with lodging and heating.\nThe plaintiff kept the school from August, 1877, until July, 1891, fourteen years.\nThe plaintiff alleged that during this period the monthly fees payable on account of the children attending the school belonged exclusively to the plaintiff, but that the School Commissioners received these fees and refused to render any account of them, or to pay them over; and she brought her action to compel them to make such payment.\nIt was admitted by the parties that the plaintiff was engaged at the same salary and upon the same conditions as the Sisters of Providence viz., $200 per annum, when they themselves provided lodging and heating; and $144 per annum when the Commissioners provided lodging and heating.\nBut the plaintiff contended that she was entitled to the monthly fees over and above the salary mentioned, and she based her action on sec. 68 of ch. 15 C. S. L. C. which enacts as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe monthly fees payable on account of children attending a Model School, or a separate girl's school, or a school kept by some religious community forming a school district, shall form no part of the school fund but such monthly fees, to the amount established for the other children in the municipality, shall be payable directly to the teacher, and be for his or her use unless different monthly fees have been agreed upon.\"\nThe defendants by their pleas alleged that the plaintiff had no right to these fees, because the Reverend Sisters never pretended to have any right to receive them;\nbecause the plaintiff received her salary each year without reserving any right to receive these fees\nbecause on the 4th January, 1892, she sued the defendants for a part of her salary and did not include any claim for those monthly fees and she must be considered as having abandoned her right to those fees; and\nbecause her salary of $144 const tuted a different monthly payment or agreement (une retribution on convention differente) which deprived the plaintiff of the right to claim the monthly fees, even assuming she would otherwise have the rat to them\nThe defendants also pleaded a plea of prescription which need not now be considered.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs action for the reasons set out in the pleas of the defendants above summarized, and this judgment was confirmed by the Queen's Bench.\nA bond has been filed to the form of which objection has been taken by counsel for defendants\nThe registrar, before whom the application came in the first instance, held that there was no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal as no rights in future would be bound, and he referred to Bank of Toronto v Le Gour\u00e9, S\u00e7c., de Ste Vierge ([1]); and Gilbert v.Gilman ([2]). J. A. Ritchie then made a motion by way of appeal from the above decision of the registrar in chambers before Mr. Justice Tascherauu who refused the motion.\nThereupon an application was made to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nJ.

F. agreed in writing to sell land to c. F. and others subject to mortgages thereon, C. F. to hold same in trust to pay half the proceeds to l. F. and the other half to himself and associates. When the agreement was made it was understood that a company was to be formed to take the property, and before the transaction was completed such company was incorporated and l. F. became a member receiving stock as part of the consideration for his transfer. C. F. filed a declaration that he held the property in trust for the company but gave no formal conveyance. An action having been brought against L. F. to recover interest due on a mortgage against the property C. F. was brought in as third party to indemnify l. F., his vendor, against a judgment in said action.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Taschereau and King JJ. dissenting, that the evidence showed that the sale was not to C. F. as a purchaser on his own behalf but for the company and the company and not C. F. was liable to indemnify the vendor.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of defendant against the third party.\nThe material facts of the case are stated by Mr. Justice Sedge wick in his judgment as follows: On the 1st December, 1882, the defendant L. P. Fairbanks mortgaged certain property known as the Shubenacadie Canal property to the plaintiff William G. Coombs for the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000) and on the 30th March, 1892, the mortgagee commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to recover the interest then due. After the mortgagor was served with a writ he gave notice under the Judicature Act to Messrs. C. F. Fraser (the appellant), B. F. Pearson and A. M, Fraser, claiming that as they were then the owners of the equity of redemption, and the lands in question were conveyed to them subject to the mortgage, they were under obligation to indemnify the defendant against all claims under the mortgage. This liability was disputed and the claim came on for hearing before Mr Justice Ritchie who gave judgment in favour of the defendant Fairbanks against C. F. Fraser (the appellant) for the amount of interest claimed, but dismissed the claim as against A. M. Fraser and B. F. Pearson\u2014the formal judgment as respects Fraser being as follows:\u2014\n\"It is ordered that judgment be entered herein for the said Lewis P. Fairbanks against the said Charles F. Fraser for the amount of the judgment debt and costs recovered in this suit against said Fairbanks by said John M. Chisholm, together with his costs of defence herein against the plaintiff, John M. Chisholm, and of the proceedings against said third parties.\"\nThe circumstances under which the appellant Fraser's liability has arisen would appear to be as follows:\u2014On the 17th April, 1889, an act of the Nova Scotia Legislature was passed incorporating R. L. Borden, B. F. Pearson and Alfred Whitman, and their associates, a body corporate under the name of the Halifax Land Improvement Company for the purpose generally of dealing in real estate, the capital to be one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the company being at liberty to issue paid-up stock in exchange for or in payment of the price of any property, real or personal, which it might acquire or hold, and having the right to commence active operations whenever twenty-five per cent of the capital stock was subscribed and twenty per cent paid up.\nThe company was organized and a general meeting held in August following. Previous, however, to the organization of the company,. and before the 26th of July, the appellant, C. F. Fraser, and L. P. Fairbanks had several conversations relating to the transfer of the Shubenacadie Canal property to the company Fairbanks having first made himself acquainted with the provisions of the charter, the company not then being organized. The following agreement was thereafter entered into between Fairbanks and the third parties sought to be made liable in the case.\n\"Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this twenty-sixth day of July, A.D. 1889, between Lewis P. Fairbanks, of Dartmouth, in the county of Halifax, and province of Nova Scotia, merchant, the party hereto of the first part, and C. F. Fraser, of Halifax, in the county of Halifax, publisher, B. F. Pearson, of Halifax aforesaid, barrister-at-law, and A. Milne Fraser, of Halifax aforesaid, publisher, the parties hereto of the second part.\"\n\"Witnesseth, that the party hereto of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar paid to him, and divers other consideration, agrees to give a good and sufficient deed with the usual full covenants of the canal property, waters, water-courses and privileges appertaining thereto, from himself and his son within thirty days to C. F. Fraser aforesaid, subject to mortgages amounting to not more than $15,000.\" \"2. He agrees to assign all options and interests in the said property held by him from W. J. Fraser and others to said property or any part thereof; also, all interest of himself or son or the canal company in all claims for damages, or for use of water privilege, or for mines and mining rights against any and all persons whomsoever, unto C. F. Fraser.\"\n\"3. Parties of the second part agree to pay $2,500 in 3, 6 and 9 months, to be secured by joint notes in three equal instalments\u2014proceeds of notes to go towards payment of certain judgments against property to be conveyed\u2014and all taxes thereon, as far as necessary to pay the same.\"\n\"4. C. F. Fraser agrees to hold said property in trust in the following proportions: One-half of all proceeds of property and damages to be paid to L. P. Fairbanks, and one-half to A. M. Fraser, C. F. Fraser and B. F. Pearson in equal proportions, after payment of all encumbrances on said property.\"\n\"In witness whereof the said parties hereto have hereunto set and subscribed their seals and hands this 26th day of July, A.

FORBES.\"\nB. F. Pearson, one of the parties to this agreement, was one of the corporators named in the company's act of incorporation, and the appellant A. M. Fraser had in the meantime also become interested in the company. In accordance with and in part performance of this agreement the notes for two thousand five hundred dollars were given to Fairbanks and were paid at maturity, and on the 26th of August following Fairbanks conveyed to C. F. Fraser the lands and rights referred to in the agreement by an absolute deed in fee simple, subject, however, to the mortgage sued on in this case. By this time the company had been organized and on the 23rd of November, the appellant, Fraser, executed and registered a declaration of trust declaring in effect that he held the lands conveyed to him by Fairbanks, in trust for and on behalf of the company. On November 21st, the defendant, Fairbanks, gave the following order to the company:\u2014\n\"HALIFAX, November 21, 1889.\nTo the Halifax Land Improvement Company, Limited.\nSirs,\u2014Please pay and deliver to C. F. Fraser or order $25,000 cash and 1,500 fully paid up and non-assessable shares and stock of a par value of ten dollars each of the capital stock in the said Halifax Land Improvement Company, Limited, which said sum of $25,000 and said shares are payable to me as the consideration or purchase price of the lands and privileges known as the \"Shubenacadie Canal Company,\" sold by me to the said Halifax Land Improvement Company, Limited, by deeds to C. F. Fraser as the president and trustee of the said company for that purpose.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd) LEWIS P. FAIRBANKS.\nWitness,\nL. Fairbanks.\"\nThe stock in this order referred to was transferred and the following receipts were taken from Fraser and Fairbanks:\n\"HALIFAX, N.S., November 21, 1889.\nReceived of the Halifax Land Improvement Company, (Limited), the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars cash, and fifteen hundred shares, fully paid up and non-assessable, of the capital stock of said company, payable to me under an order of this date from Lew i P.

F. Fraser, trustee, of all the property, real and personal, waters, water-courses, rights, privileges and easements, of the property known as the \"Shubenacadie Canal Company,\" and in full satisfaction and discharge of all demands and claims against said C. F. Fraser and the Halifax Land Improvement Company, Limited, to date.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd) LEWIS P. FAIRBANKS.\nWitness,\n(Sgd.) C. Fairbanks.\"\nFairbanks at the same time gave another receipt for the moneys referred to in the agreement of the 26th July, as follows:\u2014\n\"HALIFAX, N.S., November 21, 1889.\nReceived of C. F. Fraser, B. F. Pearson and A. Milne Fraser, all of Halifax, the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars in full satisfaction of the transfer and sale by me to them of the lands and privileges mentioned in the memorandum of agreement between said parties and myself, and dated the 26th day of July, A.D. 1889, and I acknowledge full satisfaction of the conditions named in said agreement on their part to be performed. And I do hereby covenant and agree on my part to fully carry out and execute all conditions in said agreement to be by me performed when and wherever required so to do by said parties or by the Halifax Land Improvement (Limited), or its assigns, and to execute all documents, deeds and assurances at my own cost, in accordance with the terms of said agreement of the 26th day of July, A.D. 1889.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) LEWIS P. FAIRBANKS.\nTo C. F. Fraser, Esq., Halifax, N.S.\nWitness:\n(Sgd.) C. Fairbanks.\"\nUpon the foregoing facts the trial judge found that under the agreement of the 26th July, C. F. Fraser was legally liable to indemnify Fairbanks against the mortgage upon the property.\nHis judgment was affirmed by the full court, from whose decision the defendant, Fraser, appealed.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellant, cited Wolveridge v. Steward[1].\nHarris Q.C. for the respondent, referred on the merits to Jones v. Kearney[2]; Re Cozier[3]; and claimed that a new trial should be ordered if the judgment was not sustained, citing British Canadian Loan Co. v. Tear[4].\nBorden Q.C. in reply, argued that a new trial could not be granted, not having been asked for in the court below and being inconsistent with the relief claimed by the action. FOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I adopt the findings of Ritchie J. at the trial, and the reasoning of Meagher J. in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plain conclusion from the evidence is that the intention of all the parties to the agreement of the 26th of July, 188J, was that the appellant C. F. Fraser should hold the lands and premises mentioned therein when conveyed by Fairbanks to him subject to the mortgages for $15,000 which was the only estate Fairbanks had it in his power to convey, upon trust for sale and upon sale upon trust to pay to Fairbanks himself one-half of the money to accrue from such sale over and above all incumbrances, and the other half in three equal proportions to himself and to A M. Fraser and B. F. Pearson respectively.\nUpon the transfer by Fairbanks to the appellant under that agreement the latter became no more liable to pay off the mortgage or to indemnify Fairbanks therefrom than did A. M. Fraser or Pearson or Fairbanks himself. The appellant was not an actual vendor of the property at a price agreed upon of which the mortgage itself constituted a part so as to subject him to the equitable obligation to pay off the mortgage and to indemnify his vendor therefrom. He held the property so transferred to him solely as a trustee to sell and upon effecting a sale to divide the purchase money as above stated. There was no sale of the property whatever until the sale to the Halifax Land Improvement Company which sale, and the consideration therefor given by the company for the property, Fairbanks himself most unequivocally concurred in by becoming, as part of the terms of the sale, a member of the company and the owner of paid up shares therein as constituting part of the purchase money agreed upon. Until that sale was effected there was no person who could have been called upon by Fairbanks to indemnify him against the mortgage and the only persons who could be so called upon were the company who were the actual bond fide vendors of the property subject to the $ 15,000 mortgages. The fact that the transfer of the property was effected by C. F. Fraser executing a declaration of trust to hold the land for the company who paid the consideration could not have the effect of imposing upon Fraser personally an equitable obligation incurred only by the company as the actual vendees of the property and sole beneficiaries therein. The appeal must, therefore, be allowed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014It may, I suppose, be taken for granted upon the authority of Waring v. Ward[5], Joice v. Duffy[6], and Williston v. Lawson[7], that in the ordinary case of a sale of an equity of redemption, or in other words, a sale of land in mortgage upon the promise that the purchaser is to take a conveyance of the mere equity of redemption paying the vendor the specified price for that, a court of equity assumes, unless there is some agreement to the contrary, that the purchaser is to indemnify the vendor against the mortgage if there is any personal liability on his part in respect of it. This liability, however, does not arise from any contractual relationship between the original mortgagee and the purchaser, or between the vendor and the purchaser. Independently of an agreement between himself and the purchaser the mortgagee cannot recover at law or in equity against the purchaser. The right of indemnity which the vendor of the equity of redemption has is a mere equity against the purchaser arising in his favour when he has paid or has been called upon to pay the amount of the mortgage debt for which he is responsible under his original covenant. The question now is: How far is this principle applicable to the present case? I have come to the conclusion that it does not apply at all as against the appellant, Fraser, much less does it apply to the full extent stated in the judgment of the trial judge and of the majority of the court below. Fairbanks being the owner of the property in question, subject to the mortgages, entered into the agreement of the 26th of July above set out. As regards the parties now before the court the effect of that agreement, coupled with the conveyance following upon it, viewed apart from the general intention of all the parties, was to transfer to the appellant, Fraser, one-half only of Fairbanks' interest, and to create Fraser in respect to the remaining half interest a trustee for Fairbanks, or in other words, Fraser became the owner of a moiety of the property and the agent of Fairbanks for the purpose of selling the other moiety. I do not understand upon what principle Fraser has been found liable to indemnify Fairbanks in respect of that moiety. It is not pretended that he violated the conditions under which he held the property or that he in any way acted in excess of his authority as Fairbanks' agent and trustee. There is nothing whatever in the agreement to justify the contention that Fraser was precluded from selling the property until he had first paid off the mortgage. It was agreed that any profits derived from the disposal of the property after the incumbrances were paid off were to be divided equally between Fairbanks and the other parties to the agreement, but that stipulation in no way necessitated the getting in of the incumbrances before the sale. The order upon the Improvement Company given by Fairbanks and his receipt for the stock and his share of the purchase money show an absolute acquiescence and ratification on his part of Fraser's conduct in dealing with the property. The trial judge seeks to destroy altogether the effect of these documents upon the ground that they were signed by Fairbanks at the request of Fraser. I am not aware of any principle by which a person may seek to relieve himself from the effect of instruments which he has signed by stating merely that they were signed at the request of other parties interested in them. The whole evidence which these documents confirm points, I think unmistakably, to the conclusion that the dealings between Fairbanks on the one part, and Fraser and his associates on the other, in reference to the mortgaged premises had relation to an eventual transfer to the Land Improvement Company, and that the appellant, Fraser, was a mere conduit pipe by which that end was to be attained. It was not, I think, ever contemplated that Fraser should assume any obligation whatever beyond that expressly stated in the agreement, nor was it contemplated, even at the commencement of the negotiations, that Fraser himself, either on his own behalf or on behalf of himself and those associated with him, should be the actual purchaser of the property. He undoubtedly was desirous of securing the property, just as Fairbanks was desirous of transferring it to him, the lands, as Fairbanks himself says, being of no use to him as he could not operate them. At the time of the agreement the company, though incorporated, had not been organized; it had no officers to make contracts or take titles on its behalf. All transactions, therefore, the benefit of which was to be for the eventual interest of the company, had necessarily to be entered into in the name of the promoters, corporators or other persons controlling it; besides, it was evidently necessary that the corporators should have control of this very land in order that the company might organize, having reference to the special provision in the charter in relation to the purchase of property in exchange for an issue of paid-up stock. It was not explained to us at the argument why the appellant Fraser did not make an absolute conveyance to the company of the lands in question but simply declared himself a trustee for the property in respect of them. This fact, however, does not, I think, make any difference either in regard to Fraser's liability or to that of the company. The right to indemnify, which as a general rule a mortgagor who has sold his equity of redemption has against the purchaser, is an equity only; it is in no sense a legal liability; if enforceable at all it cannot be enforced except against one who in equity is a real purchaser. Fraser, in my view, never was, and Fairbanks knew he never intended to be, a purchaser on his own behalf; he was dealing from first to last on behalf of the company, and his declaration of trust in favour of the company, accepted as it was by the company through its recognized officers, created the company in equity its absolute owner he being a bare trustee only. In my judgment, under the special circumstances of this case, the company, and the company alone, can be called upon by Fairbanks to indemnify him in respect of this mortgage; the land is still there; it is under the control of the company; they receive all rents and profits from it; besides, Fairbanks knew from the very first that the company held it; in his letter to the company of the 21st November, 1891, he refers to the property \"as property sold by him to the said Halifax Land Improvement Company (Limited), by deeds to C. F. Fraser as president and trustee of said company, for that purpose he therefore cannot set up that the transfers in question were behind his back or that he had no knowledge of them.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that all proceedings in this suit against the appellant should be dismissed, and that he is entitled to his costs of all proceedings in the court below and of this appeal.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: F.

The grantee under the deed never entered upon any part of the land and in 1866 he conveyed the whole to a son of C, then about 24 years old who had resided with C. from the time he took possession. Both deeds were registered in Queen's. The son shortly after married and went to live on the Queen's Co. portion. He died in 1872, And his widow, after living with C. for a time, married P. and went back to Queen's Co. P. worked on the Lunenburg land with C. for a few years when a dispute arose and he left. C. afterwards, by an intermediate deed, conveyed the land in Lunenburg Co. to his wife.\nOn one occasion P. sent a cow upon the land in Lunenburg Co. which was driven off and no other act of ownership on that portion of the land was attempted until 1890, after C. had died, when P. entered upon the land and cut and carried away hay. In an action of trespass by C.'s widow for such entry the title to the land was not traced back beyond the deed executed in 1856.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that C.'s son not having a clear documentary title his possession of the land was limited to such part as was proved to be in his actual possession and in that of those claiming through him; that neither he nor his successors in title ever had actual possession of the land in Lunenburg Co,; that the possession of C. was never interfered with by the deeds executed; and having continued in possession for more than twenty years C. had a title to the land in Lunenburg Co. by prescription. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are stated by the trial judge as follows:\u2014\n\"This action is brought to recover damages for trespasses committed on a lot of about five acres in the occupation of the plaintiff, which lot is in the county of Lunenburg and to the north-east of and adjoining the county line between that county and Queen's County.''\n\"It was proved that one John Ryan occupied the locus and also the property adjoining in Queen's County about forty years ago. Between thirty-five and forty years ago Benjamin Cahoon moved into the house and lived there and occupied the locus until his death in 1888, and the plaintiff, who was his second wife, has occupied it ever since.''\n\"When Benjamin Cahoon moved on to the locus his son Leander, who was then a boy, went with him and continued to live with him, and worked with him on the place until his marriage in 1868. Before his marriage he commenced a new house on the Queen's County side of the line, and when it was finished he and his wife, who up to that time had lived with his father and mother, went to the new house and continued to live there until his death in 1872.\"\n\"His wife who, before her marriage, had lived with Benjamin Cahoon and his wife, returned to this house on the locus, and lived there with them until she married the defendant about 1875, when she and her husband returned to the house in (Queen's County, which her first husband had built, and have lived there ever since.\" \"Benjamin Cahoon and the defendant, after his marriage, worked on the property together until about eight years ago, when they had some dispute, and Benjamin after that worked on the locus and the defendant on the property in Queen's County.\"\n\"On the 14th October, 1856, John Ryan gave a deed of all his interest in the property at East Port Medway, containing a hundred and twenty-six acres, to Stephen Mack. It was contended that this deed did not cover the locus but only the property in Queen's County, but I am of opinion that it was intended to cover and did cover the locus. In January, 1866, when Benjamin Cahoon was in possession of the locus, Stephen Mack, who is not proved to have been in possession at any time, conveyed all his interest in the property to Leander Cahoon, son of Benjamin, using the same description as in the deed from John Ryan to him, excepting a part sold to Edward Ryan.\"\n\"And in April, 1871, Leander Cahoon conveyed to Jerusha Cahoon an undivided right in two-thirds of the lot conveyed to him by Stephen Mack, reserving the new house he had built and then lived in. Jerusha Cahoon was his mother, Benjamin's first wife; she left four children surviving her, one of whom died without issue before his father. Leander Cahoon left two children who are still living, and defendant and his wife, their mother, are their guardians duly appointed. None of the deeds above mentioned are recorded in the county in which the locus is situated, but in the county of Queen's only.\"\n\"On the 7th October, 1881, Benjamin Cahoon conveyed the locus by deed to \"William Smith (the father of the plaintiff), who by deed dated the 29th September, 1882, conveyed the same to the plaintiff, the consideration being natural love and affection, and $50, which amount the plaintiff proves that she paid in cash out of her own money. These deeds were recorded shortly after their respective dates in the county of Lunenburg, in which the land in question is situated. The trespass of cutting and removing the hay is admitted, the defendant alleging that he did it in exercise of his authority as guardian of Leander's children, who are under age and who are entitled to an undivided interest in the property, as tenants in common with other owners.\"\nUpon these facts judgment was given at the trial in favour of the plaintiff and was affirmed by the court en banc. The defendant appealed.\nMcInnes for the appellant. Leander Cahoon, having the documentary title, and being on the locus while living with his father, the latter could not acquire title by possession. Doe d Thomson v. Barnes[2]; Dettrick v. Dettrick[3]; Washburn on Seal Property[4].\nBorden Q.C: for the respondent, referred to Philipps v. Halliday[5]; Boston, etc., Railroad Co v. Sparhawk[6]; Bradstreet v. Huntington[7].\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The only question for argument in this case is whether the respondent and her late husband, Benjamin Cahoon, had been in exclusive possession of the property described in respondent's statement of claim for upwards of twenty years at the time when the acts of the appellant, which respondent claims to be trespasses, were committed.\nOn this question of fact Mr. Justice Ritchie, who tried the case, has found in favour of respondent, and his decision was supported on appeal by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco.\nMr. Justice Ritchie says:\u2014\nBetween 35 and 40 years ago Benjamin Cahoon moved into the house, and lived there and occupied the locus until his death in 1888, and the plaintiff, who was his second wife, has occupied it ever since.\nThis is not a case in which we should disturb the findings of the trial judge.\nMcCall v. McDonald[8]; Arpin v. The Queen[9]; Warner v. Murray[10]; Schwersenski v. Vineberg[11]; Lambkin v. South Eastern Railway Co.[12]; Kershaw v. Kirkpatrick[13], North German Steamship Co. v. Elder[14]; Ghoolam Moortoozah Khan Bahadoor v. The Government[15].\nGWYNNE and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nKING J.\u2014This is an action of trespass to land brought by the respondent. The land in question consists of about five acres in the county of Lunenburg, N.S., and is part of a larger tract lying principally in the county of Queen's. The facts are succinctly stated by Ritchie J., the trial judge.\nIt appears that one John Ryan was in occupation of the entire lot in or about 1850, living in a house then and now on the locus in quo. He occupied it for some-years, and when he moved out of the house Benjamin Cahoon, the now deceased husband of the plaintiff, moved in. The exact time of this does not appear but. it was found by the learned judge to have been between 35 and 40 years before, i.e., between 1851 and. 1856. Benjamin Cahoon continued to live in the house with his family and to do work upon the land in question until his death in 1888, and the plaintiff (who was his second wife) continued the occupation afterwards.\nAt the time that Benjamin Cahoon went into occupation his son Leander (through whom appellant claims) was a young child, and was brought up by and continued to live with his father, working with him upon the place until his marriage in 1868, when he and his wife, who up to that time had also lived with Benjamin Cahoon, moved into a new house which he Leander, had built on the Queen's county part of the lot, and continued to live there until his loss at sea in 1872 or 1873. After that the widow went back to live with her father-in-law, and remained there until she married Parks, the appellant, when they went to the house on the Queen's county part and have lived there since, Cahoon and Parks working on the property together until about 1882 or 1883, when a dispute arose, and Cahoon afterwards worked upon that part of the lot in Lunenburg county (the land in question), and Parks on the part in Queen's county.\nIn 1882 Parks put a cow upon the land in question and Cahoon turned it off, and Parks did not further interfere until the act of trespass complained of which was entering, cutting hay and carrying it away. This was in 1890, after Cahoon's death.\nThe claim of Parks (as guardian of the infant children of Leander) is based upon an alleged possession under the conveyances to be now referred to. I again follow substantially the statement of Mr. Justice Ritchie.\nOn the 14th October, 1856, John Ryan gave a deed of the entire lot to one Stephen Mack. It is not clear whether Ryan was then in possession or not, but Mack never went into nor had possession. This deed was recorded in Queen's County, but not in Lunenburg County.\nTen years afterwards, viz.: In January, 1866, Cahoon being still in possession, Mack conveyed all his interest in the property to Leander Cahoon, then, as before stated, living with his father. This deed also was recorded in Queen's County but not in Lunenburg.\nIn April, 1871, Leander conveyed to his mother Jerusha Cahoon what is expressed by the learned judge to be ''an undivided right in two thirds of the lot conveyed to him by Mack, reserving the new house he had built and then lived in.\"\n(Was it. this or an undivided two thirds interest?)\nThis deed, like the others, was recorded in Queen's County only.\nOn 7th October, 1881, Benjamin Cahoon conveyed the Locus in quo by deed to the plaintiff, his second wife, through an intermediate conveyance. These deeds were registered in the County of Lunenburg.\nThere are well reasoned judgments of the learned judges, Townshend, Graham and Meagher JJ., (the latter dissenting) resulting in affirmance of a judgment given by Ritchie J. for plaintiff.\nAll the parties to the above conveyances are dead and it is not possible to be very positive as to the real facts.\nIf one might surmise it might be supposed that the conveyance from Ryan to Mack, which was, I should judge, about contemporaneous with Cahoon's first possession, was made in Cahoon's interest, and that Mack's conveyance after the lapse of nearly ten years to Cahoon's son Leander, then living with his father, was in pursuance of a desire to avoid holding the legal title.\nBut the matter has to be determined apart from surmises. If Leander had had a clear documentary title there could be no question that he would, under the circumstances, have been in constructive possession of the whole lot included in his deed, but, not having clear documentary title, his possession is limited to such part as is proved to be in his actual possession (by himself or others) and in that of those succeeding to him.\nBenjamin Cahoon was in undoubted possession of the whole lot from the time he went upon the land, until 1886. The value of possession is stated anew by Lord Herschell, in Philipps v. Halliday[16].\nThen how was his possession affected by what afterwards took place?\nThere may be much reasonableness in the conclusion of Meagher J. that Cahoon knew in 1866 of the deed from Mack to his son, and of the deed in 1871 from the son to his mother, but it is only an inference, and to affect Cahoon's possession it requires another inference, viz., that Benjamin Cahoon recognized these conveyances as passing title and subordinated his own possession to them, holding thereafter under his son. All the circumstances are to be regarded in determining whether the character of Cahoon's possession changed. The deeds referred to did not of themselves give right of possession; and the actual possession under them, what was really done under them, has to be regarded, for looking at them as explanatory of the facts of possession it is not immaterial that all the parties receiving these conveyances treated them as applying to the land in the county of Queen's and not to that in the county of Lunenburg for they were recorded in the former but not in the latter county. Then, Leander's house Was built in Queen's. I fail to see upon the whole evidence that it sufficiently appears that Benjamin Cahoon's possession of the locus in quo was interfered with or intended to be interfered with; I do not see that the son manifested any intention of taking possession of the whole lot, or that the father manifested any intention to treat his own possession as a possession under his son. In 1882 Parks put his cow in upon the land in question and Benjamin Cahoon turned it off, and the possession of Benjamin Cahoon was not again disturbed during his life, nor (after his death) until 1890. Leander's possession, if such it was, had begun only in 1866, and therefore, in 1882, his heirs had acquired no title by possession, and their possession of the locus in quo was terminated by the above act of Benjamin Cahoon, who thereafter continued in exclusive possession (in right of his wife) until his death. The separate possession of Benjamin Cahoon was apparently recognized by Parks himself after 1882.\nIn my opinion the proper conclusion is that Cahoon's possession of the locus in quo was never otherwise than in him in his own right (or. that of his present wife since the transfer to her) and on his own and her account, and that, at any rate, he had an exclusive possession thereof after 1882 and up to the time of the trespass complained of.\nI agree, therefore, with the learned judges Townshend and Graham JJ. and think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: F.

Q.)\u2014Interpretation Act sec. 19 R. S. Q. \u2014Railway subsidy\u2014Discretionary Power of Lieutenant Governor in Council\u2014Petition of right\u2014Misappropriation of subsidy moneys by order in council.\nWhere money is granted by the legislature and its application is prescribed in such a way as to confer a discretion upon the-Crown no trust is imposed enforceable against the Crown by petition of right.\nThe appellant railway company alleged by petition of right that by virtue of 51 & 52 Vic. ch. 91 the Lieutenant governor in council was authorized to grant 4000 acres of land per mile for 30 miles of the Hereford Railway; that by an order in council dated 6th August. 1888, the land subsidy was converted into a money subsidy, the 9th section of said oh. 91, 51 & 52 Vic, enacting that \"it. shall be lawful, \" &c, to convert; that the company completed the construction of their line of railway relying upon the said, subsidy and order in council, and built the railway in accordance with the act 51 & 52 Vic. ch. 91 and the provisions of the Railway Act of Canada 51 Tic. ch. 29 and they claimed to be entitled to the sum of $49000 balance due on said subsidy. The Crown demurred on the ground that the statute was permissive only, and by exception pleaded inter alia, that the money had been paid by order in council to the sub-contractors for work necessary for the construction of the road; that the president had by letter agreed to accept an additional subsidy on an extension of their line of railway to settee difficulties and signed a receipt for the balance of $6 000 due on account of the first subsidy. The petition of right was dismissed.\nHeld that the statute and documents relied on did not create a liability on the part of the Crown to pay the money voted to the appellant company enforceable by petition of right; Taschereau and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting; but assuming it did the letter and receipt signed by the president of the company did not discharge the Crown from such obligation to pay the subsidy, and payment by the Crown of the sub-contractors' claim out of the subsidy money, without the consent of the company, was a misappropriation of the subsidy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Quebec, dismissing a petition of right brought by the Hereford Railway Company, whereby a sum of $425500, balance of a subsidy voted by the legislature, was claimed.\nThis was a petition of right against Her Majesty the Queen (province of Quebec) concluding for a declaration by the Superior Court of the province of Quebec that the suppliants (appellants) are entitled to receive the sum of $42,500 as a part of a money subsidy due for constructing thirty miles of the Hereford Railway.\nThe facts and pleadings and the sections of the statutes and orders in council upon which the claim is based, are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given.\nBrown Q.C. and Stuart Q.C. for appellants. The statute granting the subsidy in this case couples with the power to pay the duty to exercise that power so soon as the railway company has fulfilled its obligation, and there is no pretence here that the company has not earned the grant but simply that the lieutenant governor can exercise a capricious discretion. We take it to be a well established rule that no statute which requires the action of the Crown is written in imperative terms, but that none the less is the obligation imposed upon the Crown to act on every occasion when the public interest or the rights of a private individual require it. Lapierre v. Rodier ([1]); Cooley's Constitutional Limitations ([2]); Sedgewick on Statutorv and Constitutional Law ([3]) Potter's Dwarris on Statutes ([4]); Julius v. The Bishop of Oxford ([5]).\nThe judgment of the Superior Court asserts the right of the company to the subsidy claimed, but holds it to have been determined by payment and subrogation by release and compromise. There was no authority given by the company to the payment by the Crown out of their subsidy of any moneys due to the sub-contractors for work of construction No subrogations were produced from these sub-contractors against the company and the Crown cannot in law claim the benefit of any of these payments Arts. 1155-1156 C.C.\nThen again, the money was in the hands of the lieutenant governor in trust for the company, and we claim we are now entitled to the money, (which right has been recognized by the order in council of 16th August, 1888,) and can recover it by petition of right. This right is also impliedly recognized by 54 Vic. c. 88 (P.Q.) The lieutenant governor in council exercised his discretion for warrants were issued and the money instead of coming into the hands of the company went into the hands of third parties to be used for debts for which there is no legal evidence that the company were liable Then as to the ratification by the \"presto dent we say he was not authorized to write such a letter by the board and he cannot bind the company in such a matter without a resolution of the board of directors, and his letter was not even acknowledged or acted on. See Art. 360 0.C.; D'Arcy v. The Tanear &c,. Railway Co. ([6]); Kirk v. Bell ([7]); Morawetz on Private Corporations ([8]).\nIf there was a liability on the part of the government for the payment of the subsidy now proceeded for that liability was not extinguished by an unauthorized offer of compromise, unaccepted by the Government and the terms of which have not been fulfilled\nDrouin Q.C. for respondent. The principal question to be decided on this appeal is whether a binding, contract was entered into between the government of the province of Quebec and the suppliant company.\nWe submit first the following proposition: The words \"is authorized to grant\" used in the statutes 45 Vie cap. 23 and 49 & 50 Vie. cap. 77 and others by which they were amended, are permissive and not imperative.\nArticle 19 of the R. S. P . Q. and the 4 s.-s. of section 7 of the Interpretation Act are too absolute in their meaning for anyone to presume that the legislature intended that the courts should not be bound by the strict grammatical interpretation.\nThe grant of a railway subsidy in this case was a mere permission given to the lieutenant governor in council to apply for the building of that railway the lands or the money intrusted to him for that purpose. See 45 Vic. cap. 23, sec. 2.\nAnd if a company is obliged to demand a subsidy it has no right to it; if the lieutenant governor in council can consider and declare that he is satisfied or not satisfied he has the discretionary power to do so; the right to receive, and the corresponding obligation to give this subsidy, are only created by the order in council asked for and passed after deliberation according to section 10 of 45 Vic. ch. 77, and to the act to which it refers 45 Vic. ch. 23.\nSo far there cannot be any doubt; the will to allow, to authorize, is exactly what the words express it; that conviction is forced upon one's mind.\nThe fact that the law does not specify who are the persons that are to profit by the subsidy and from the comparative quotations from the statutes cited by the appellant and other similar statutes; from the well understood intention of the legislator; from a sound consideration of the public interest; from the important distinction to be made between a statute admitting a vested right and a statute which creates one; it follows, that in the present case not only is there the doubt which, according to the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in the case ln re the Medical college and Palid\u00e8s, makes it a duty to adopt the natural meaning of the terms; but there is moreover absolute certainty on the parity of the grammatical and the legal senses.\nThen we submit that 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 76, is only an act making it optional for the railway companies to ask for money in lieu of lands if the subsidies are granted to them. The proof of it is found in the fact that the legislation requires the companies to make two separate demands, one by which they ask the subsidy, and. the second, by which they apply for the conversion of the land, subsidy into a money subsidy. Section 10, 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 77, previously quoted, enacts that:\nIn the event of any company, having within the delay prescribed in subsection 1 of section 2 of the Act 45 Victoria, chapter 23,, applied for any subsidy mentioned in the said act and furnished proof of its resources to construct its road, the Order in Council may issue at any time thereafter if the Lieutenant-Governor is satisfied with the proof furnished.\nNeither this section nor the clause to which it refers has been repealed. To acquire a final right to a subsidy it is not sufficient for a company to apply for the conversion, and even after an order in council has acknowledged the application the company has no more right than previously. It is clearly seen that even after that another company with greater resources might come forward to which it would be in the public interest to grant the subsidy. According to the law, even after that conversion, the company must ask and obtain an order in council by which the lieutenant governor in council grants the subsidy to said company. Alone that order in council creates the right of a company to a subsidy.\nIt is a well known principle that the sovereign, like private individuals, is bound by the common law and according to common law there must be a fixed consideration for every contract. Now, as seen previously, the order in council upon which the claim of the appellant is based declares that the company has made the option, according to section 14, 51 & 52 Vic. ch. 91 and that section says:\nIt shall be lawful for the Lieutenant Governor in Council to convert any subsidy in land by paying a sum not exceeding thirty-five cents \"per acre.\nIs that a fixed measure ? A real contract? Evidently no for the Crown was limited to a maximum which was not to be exceeded; it could not pay more than thirty-five cents an acre but it could par less. Where then is the operation which has fixed and determined this measure and which would have finally created the right of the appellant ? Nowhere, for it has never asked the order in council required by the clauses of the law above quoted. It would be a useless attempt to supply that missing link by the contention that 35 cents is the price inscribed in the books of the provincial treasurer. We would answer that the lieutenant governor in council has the right to fix that price, and that it is a well known principle that the Crown cannot be bound by the laces and the acknowledgments of the public officers, or even of the ministers. If again it was argued that there has been a defined practice. of thus acting in the application of similar provisions we would reply that this practice, if it exists, resulting only from individual action, has no legal character and cannot bind the Crown. Morawetz on Corporations ([9]); Bryce on Ultra Vires,([10]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This petition of right has been presented for the purpose of obtaining from the Crown, as representing the province of Quebec, the payment of a subsidy granted by the legislature of that province in aid of the construction of the suppliants railway.\nThe Crown insists that the subsidy in question,. having been granted by the legislature in such terms as made the payment of it optional and discretionary with the lieutenant governor of the province, is not money recoverable by means of a petition of right. It is further set up on behalf of the Crown that so much of the money granted as was not paid over to the suppliants was duly applied by the government in payment of certain claims against the contactors for the railway. And lastly, that by a certain receipt signed on behalf of the suppliants and by the terms of a certain application by the president of the railway company to the first minister of the province of Quebec, the suppliants renounced their present claim.\nBy the statute of Quebec 45 Vic. cap. 23, sec. 1 (a general subsidy Act), it is enacted as follows:\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council is authorized to grant the following subsidies in and for the construction of the railways herein filter designated.\nAnd subsection o of the same section is as follows:\nA quantity of four thousand acres of land per mile for a railway starting from a point on the frontier of the Province of Quebec, to affect a junction with the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railway to a point ten miles from Hall's stream, provided the length of such road does not exceed thirty miles.\n51 & 52 Vie. cap 91, sec. 9, is as follows:\nIt shall be lawful for the Lieutenant Governor in Council to grant a subsidy of four thousand acres of land per mile to the Hereford Railway Company, for a railway starting from a junction with the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railway, or other railway on the frontier of the Province of Quebec, within ten miles of Hall's stream, thence to a junction with the International Railway, in the Township of Eaton, provided the length of such railway does not exceed thirty-five miles.\nThe 10th section of the same Act is in these words:\nParagraph of section 1 of the act 45 Vic. cap. 23, is hereby repealed, the International Railway Company having by an instrument in writing passed in June last transferred to the Hereford Railway Company all its rights to the land subsidy granted by the said statute to the railway described in said paragraph o.\nThe 14th section of this Act is as follows:\nIt shall be lawful for the Lieutenant Governor in Council to convert in whole or in part any subsidy in land to which any company maybe entitled in virtue of this act into a money subsidy by paying a sum not exceeding thirty-five cents per acre at the time the said subsidy becomes due, and another sum not exceeding thirty-five cents per acre when the lands allotted to the said company under this act shall have been sold and paid for pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Department of Crown Lands and subject to such conditions to secure the construction of the road to which the said subsidy shall apply, as the Lieutenant Governor in Council may establish; provided that the Company entitled to any land subsidy under this act shall declare its option within the delay of two years after the passing of this act in favour of the said conversion of the said subsidy by a resolution of its board of directors duly communicated to the Government through the Commissioner of Public Works\nOn the 2nd of -August 1888 an order in council was passed which is printed in the case, and which (after many long recitals which need not be set forth and including one to the effect that the suppliants had declared their option for a conversion of the subsidy into money, and recognizing that the International Railway Company, which had become entitled to the subsidy granted by 45 Vic. ch. 23, had transferred its rights to the suppliants) proceeded as follows:\u2014\nL'Honorable Commissaire recommande qu'il soit donn\u00e9e acte a la dite Compagnie du chemin de far de Hereford tant en son nom propre que comme \u00e9tant aux droits et actions de la dite Compagnie de l'international des conversions en argent par ella ainsi effectu\u00e9es, de la subvention en terres de 4000 acres par mille ainsi accord\u00e9e at mentionn\u00e9e dans et par las dites clauses 9 et 10 pour la ligne de chemin de fer v d\u00e9crite et que les dites conversions en argent soient ratifi\u00e9es at confirm\u00e9es en faveur de la dite Compagnie du chemin da far da Hereford, pour toutes fins qua da droit, sous l'autorit\u00e9 at en conformit\u00e9 da la clause 14 de l'Acte des subventions en premier lieu cite\nCertain \"persons who had contracted with the suppliants' principal contractor for the construction of their line of railway having absconded, leaving subcontractors under them and workmen unpaid the government of the province of Quebec on the 17th of April, 1889, appointed John P. Noyes as a commissioner to inquire into and investigate the claims of the persons thus remaining unpaid. On the 28th August, 1889, Noyes made his report. Pursuant to the report the government paid the sum of $42,500, but a very small portion of which appears to have been applied for the benefit of the suppliants, or in discharge of debts or claims for which they were liable, this money having been paid to persons to whom the absconding contractors were indebted, debts for which the suppliants were in no way responsible.\nThe residue of the subsidy remaining after the payments out of it made undei N\u00f3yes's report amounted $6500. This amount was on the 8th of August, 1890, paid over to the suppliants pursuant to the warrant of the lieutenant governor, dated the 7th of August, 1890. when the suppliants by the agency of their president signed the receipt below. As the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is founded on this warrant and receipt I set it out in extenso. These documents are as follows\nBy His Honour\nThe Honourable Auguste-R\u00e9al Angers,\nLieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec\nNo. 511 on No. 1010, $6,500.\nTo the Honourable the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec\nYou are hereby authorized and required out of such monies as are-in, or shall come to your hands, for defraying the expenses of the Civil Government of the Province of Quebec to pay or cause to be paid unto The Hereford Railway Company, or to their assigns, the sum of six thousand five hundred dollars being on account of the balance of the first thirty-five cents per acre of converted land subsidy of 4,000 acres per mile, on 35 miles under O.

W. B. IVES,\nPresident. The suppliants went on and completed the construction of their line of railway, and on January, 1890, the same was duly inspected by the railway engineer of the Quebec government, and that officer, by his report in writing dated the 8th of January, 1890, certified to the commissioner of public works that the railway had been satisfactorily completed.\nIn a letter dated January 20th, 1890, written by the Hon. William B. Ives president of the suppliants' company to the Hon. Mr. Mercier then minister at the head of the government for the province of Quebec, allusion is made to an additional subsidy for eighteen miles of the line of the suppliants'' railway other than the thirty-five miles for which the first subsidy had been granted. The following extract from the letter referred to contains all that is material to the present question:\nI have to add that a subsidy of say $3,000 permile upon this eighteen miles voted on condition that the Government retained and paid out of it the claims against Messrs. Shirley, Corbett & Company as established, by Mr. John P. Noyes, would be acceptable to this company and would put at rest all the difficulties that have arisen with regard to these claims.\nThis letter does not appear by the evidence to have been answered but a grant of the amount mentioned for the eighteen miles referred to was subsequently made by the legislature of the province of Quebec to-the suppliants', no reference, however, being made in the act granting the subsidy to the application or to-the terms indicated in the president's letter.\nMr. Justice Caron before whom the cause was heard in the Superior Court, dismissed the petition of right upon three grounds; first, because the payment under Noyes's report was a due application of the subsidy pro tanto; secondly, because the $54,000 granted as a subsidy for the eighteen miles must be presumed to have been so granted on the terms of the president's letter and was thus in satisfaction of all claims arising out of the misappropriation of the first subsidy; and. thirdly, because the receipt appended at the foot of the warrant was an express renunciation of all claims to any further payment on account of the grant.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench adopted as the reasons of its judgment the second and third only of these grounds.\nI am of opinion that the Court of Queen's Bench were right in rejecting the first c consid\u00e9rant \" of the Superior Court. If there was any legal obligation binding on the Crown to pay this money to the suppliants that obligation could not possibly be discharged by payments made without the assent of the railway company in liquidation of demands against Shirley, Corbett & Company, the absconding contractors, to whom it does not appear that the railway company were in any way indebted.\nIn favour of the two other grounds of the first judgment which were adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench more may be said, though I cannot agree in either of them. The receipt at the foot of the warrant does not, as it seems to me amount to a renunciation. It does, it is true, refer to the $6500 as being a balance of the subsidy, but I cannot say that it shows that it was the intention of the company to waive all further demand for the rest of the subsidy. The letter of the president, and the subsequent grant of the amount suggested by him, without more, cannot bind the company. No resolution of the board of directors authorized the writing of this letter, and the president had therefore no. authority to bind the company. It cannot be pretended that the company in accepting the subsidy must be taken to have implicitly ratified the terms proposed by Mr. Ives for it is not shown that these terms and conditions were ever brought to the notice of the directors either when the letter was written or when they accepted the second subsidy. It must therefore be taken as proved that the company had no knowledge whatever, at any time, of Mr. Ives's litter or of the proposal which he therein made to the (government. This, therefore, also appears to me to be an insufficient ground for refusing relief to the suppliants.\nI am, nowever, of opinion that on a broader ground, that principally insisted on by the Attorney General, the petition of right was properly dismissed.\nIt is argued on the part of the appellants that by taking the order in council converting the subsidy from the land into money the Crown entered into a contract with the suppliants to pay them the subsidy.\nI cannot accede to this proposition. I. see nothing in the terms of the order in council itself indicating that the Crown intended there by to do more than the statute under which it was passed authorized namely to provide for substitution of money for land in such a way that the government should be in the same position, and bound by no greater obligation as regarded the money than it was originally bound by as regarded the land.\nThen, the suppliants'' right to this money must depend altogether on the statute ([11]) granting the subsidy, and if this did not create a liability on the part of the government to pay the money no statutory liability in respect of this money ever existed.\nThe language of the act is permissive and facultative; it makes no direct grant to the railway company, but in using the words i it shall be lawful for the lieutenant governor to grant\" it imports that the Crown is to exercise its discretion in \"paying over or withholding the money as it may think fit. In the case of The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury ([12]) Lord Blackburn says: When the money has been voted and an appropriation act passed this act must be construed, when it comes before us like any other act The Appropriation Act regulates so far as it goes what is to be done with the money.\nIn the well known case of Julius v. The Bishop of Oxford ([13]), Lord Cairns speaking of the act in question there (which was not, it is true, a money act) says:\nAnd the words i it shall be lawful\" being according to their natural meaning permissive or enabling words only it lies upon those as it seems to me who content that an obligation exists to exercise this power to show in the circumstances of the case something which according to the principles I have mentioned creates this obligation.\nSection 19 of the Revised. Statutes of Quebec (the interpretation Act) is also directly applicable and so absolute in its terms as to preclude the possibility of interpreting these words as implying any obligation enforceable by petition of right or otherwise.\nThis section 19 is in these words\nWhenever it is provided that a thing \"shall\" be done or \"must\" be done, the obligation is imperative, but if it is provided that a thing \"may \" be done, its accomplishment is permissive.\nThen, there is no reason here why the words should be read in any other than their primary meaning. The grant of the subsidy was pure bounty on the part of the legislature. No advantages, privileges or benefits in the case of the railway to be constructed were stipulated for in favour of the government, and there was no reason why the control of the money by the lieutenant governor should not be retained down to \"the last moment before payment. It is said that the suppliants' relied on receiving the money and were thus induced to construct their railway at a great expenditure of their own moneys, but they had no right to rely on the act any further than its terms warranted them in doing so. Then, no statutory obligation was cast upon the Crown either as regards the money or the land. I cannot read section 4 of 49 & 50 Vic. cap. 76 as imposing an absolute obligation to pay when; a railway shall be completed; this is apparent from the 5th section which authorizes the lieutenant governor to impose terms. The words we have to look at are the words of the 51 & 52 Vic. cap. 91 for the 4th section of 49 & 50 Vic. cap. 76, does not apply to grants under the subsequent act, and these words, as I have shown, are not obligatory. Therefore, neither on the ground of contract nor on that of statutory obligation are the suppliants' entitled to succeed. There remains the ground of trust. Can it be said that the Crown is by the statute made a trustee or quais trustee of this money to hold it until the railway should be completed and then pay it over to the company ? Several cases have been before the English courts where moneys have come into the hands of the Crown for the purpose of being distributed amongst a certain class of persons. Such were the cases of Kinloch v. The Queen ([14]), and Rustomjee v. The Queen ([15]), in both of which it was determined that money so held by the Crown could not be considered as subject to a trust enforce able by means of a petition of right. I see no reason why the principle of these cases should not apply here. If no enforceable trust is to be considered as imposed when money to be applied to a particular designated purpose is placed in the hands of the Crown under treaty or otherwise than by act of parliament, why should the conclusion be different where the money is granted by the legislature and its application is prescribed in such a way as to confer a discretion \"upon the Crown? No reason can be suggested for such a difference.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed. FOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with my brother Sedge-wick, whose notes I have read, that this appeal should be allowed.\nOn the only question that can, it seems to me, give rise to any controversy in the case, and the only one upon which we do not agree, that is to say the question whether the appellant company has a right of action or not, the appellant has, in its favour the judgment of Mr. Justice Routhier upon the demurrer and, though not in express terms, the judgments of both the Superior Court and of the court of appeal, which, as I read them, both concede his right of action. I take it for granted now that the payment to the contractors' men cannot be invoked against the appellant, and that Mr. Ives's letter cannot in any way militate against them. It is clear that a payment to B. of what is due to A. cannot prejudice A. and as to Mr. Ives's letter there is not a word of evidence leaving aside the want of authorization proved by himself in the case, that it was ever acted upon, or taken into consideration, or even given communication of to the legislature. Then the subsidy granted in 1890, 54 Vie. c. 88, is for an extension line of this railway and not for the same line subsidized previously. We are unanimous in rejecting that part of the defence based on these two facts, and upon which the two courts below came to a conclusion adverse to the appellant So that, if I mistake not, on each question raised in the case the appellant has in its favour the majority of the judges who in the different courts have had to adjudicate upon it, though they lose their case. This subsidy, I may preliminarily remark, is not to be considered as a gratuity. It is a grant for consideration. The government desiring to see a railway in that locality, and, it must be assumed, no company being willing to build such a railway, in a comparatively new and unsettled part of the country, without the assistance generally given by the government to such enterprises under such circumstances, gets from the legislature the power to subsidize any company that will come forward to build it. The increase which must result from the construction of such a railway in the value of the government's own lands in that vicinity, for it appears to be township lands, is, undoubtedly also a consideration that induces the government to take that step.\nNow, upon the consideration of this subsidy so offered to the world at large and only because they are offered this subsidy, this company is formed and comes forward disburses a large capital constructs a road in a manner which the government's own engineer reports as \"tr\u00e8s satisfaisante,\" yet the govern ment would now say that they never contracted an obligation to pay them a single cent. And this after sanctioning by an order in council the conversion of this land subsidy into a cash subsidy, (which, I take it, is, by itself, an admission of liability and a promise to pay) after admitting in so many words in an order in council of 19th December, 1883, that this company had performed all the conditions precedent required by the statutes, and that it consequently had then the right to demand from the government that the land it was then entitled to as a subsidy be located and set apart, as required by section 2 of 45 Vic. ch. 23. I cite the very words of this order in council (as recited in the order in council of 1888 as found in the case) to show that there is no ambiguity in its terms, and that the Quebec government's advisers of that date did not dispute in any way this company's claim: Consid\u00e9rant * * * que la dite Compagnie avait fourni des preuves suffisantes des ressources \u00e0 sa disposition pour la construction du dit embranchement et qu'en cons\u00e9quence elle avait droit de demander la location des terres ainsi accord\u00e9es par le statut plus haut cit\u00e9.\nNow, if the company had then, in 1883, a right to the lands as this order in council admits, they have now a right to the cash subsidy. By admitting that the company had a right the government admitted an obligation on its part, a contract to pay; and if the company have a right they have an action to claim it. And this very order in council of 1888 admits that they have the same right to the-cash subsidy that they had to the laud subsidy. It admits that the International Company has ceded to the appellant company \" tous ses droits et actions,\" all its rights and actions in the said subsidy, and recognizes it as substituted to the International Company. Then, an order in council of September, 1889, authorizes the payment of Noyes's expenses \" out of the $49,000, being the subsidy at 35 cents per mile granted to this company,\" and the orders in council, one of March, 1890, and two of June, 1890, also admit that the payments thereby authorized are to be taken from the subsidy payable to the said company a aff\u00e9rente \u00e0 la dite Compagnie.\" The very order in council of April, 1889, appointing Noyes as commissioner had in the same terms decreed that his fees were to be paid Out of the subvention aff\u00e9rente \u00e0 la compagnie \"; and in the order in council of 3rd September 1890 is another admission that the company had a right to $49,000,\nTotal de la subvention de $4,000 par mille, \u00e0 laquelle ladite Compagnie avait droit.\nIn fact this right of the company would only be forfeited according to section 2 of 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 77 upon their not performing the works required by them, which event, it is conceded, has not happened. By sec. 6, 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 76, every railway company to which a subsidy of 35 cents per mile is granted, and which accepts the same, falls ipso facto under the government's control and surveillance. Here is a railway which by the law is under the government control, because it is subsidized, but to which, however, the government will not pay the amount of the subsidy, and which, though it actually receives no subsidy, is nevertheless under government control.\n(Sees. 9,10 and 14 of 51 & 52 Vic. ch. 91, recognize the present suppliant's title in lieu of the International Company, and a revote of the subsidy, extending it to 35 miles instead of 30 miles.)\nOn the 16th July, 1888, four days after the coming into force of the 51 & 52 Vic. ch. 91 the department of railways in Quebec wrote a letter to this company saying that as soon as the department would receive the company's option of a money subsidy instead of lands, the government engineer would be ordered to make the inspection required by law of any completed portion of the road, and that upon such report the proportion of the money subsidized accrued in virtue of the statute would be paid by the treasurer of the province.\nImmediately, on the 19th, the company's option is declared, and sent to the government, as acknowledged in the order in council of the 2nd August following. This order in council approves and grants the demand of these companies, ratifies and confirms \" pour toutes fins que de droit.\" in favour of the suppliants' the said conversion of a land subsidy into a cash subsidy in conformity with sec. 14 of 51 & 52 Vic. ch, 91 and this sec. 14 enacts that this money shall be paid when the subsidy becomes due. Is not that again a legislative declaration that this money is due when the railway is built to the satisfaction of the lieutenant governor in council? And further, why was the government engineer sent to inspect the railway, as it appears he was by his evidence and by his report of January 8th, 1890, filed in the case ? Did not the government thereby submit again, or admit de novo its obligation, to pay this subsidy if its engineer reported that the company had performed its duties ? When this engineer reports that the company had fulfilled all its obligations can the government repudiate its own acts and be allowed to contend that it is not bound to pay this subsidy ? I would call this a breach of faith and nothing else if such a contention under similar circumstances, was enunciated in a court of justice by any private corporation.\nThe contention that the company has, by receiving $6,500 on account, discharged the government of this liability for the balance is untenable, and, on this point we are also, I believe, unanimous. A payment on account is not a payment in full satisfaction. It is if anything at all an admission of liability as specially pleaded in suppliants replication ? Then, there is no plea to that effect, not a word in the defendant's pleas of this payment of $6,500. The only allegation of ratification, could any question of ratification have arisen, is in paragraph 12 of the pleas, which is and remains struck out by the court by the judgment of May 20th, 1892, and, as to the amended pleas of March 6th 1893. The order in council itself, of July 21st, 1890, upon which these $6,500 were paid, says that this sum is paid \" en d\u00e9duction'd'autant sur la balance lui aberrant sur la montant de la dite subvention.\" To contend that by accepting these $6,500 the company renounced all its rights to the balance of the subsidy would be equivalent to contending that the government's officers surreptitiously or smarty obtained from the company a discharge of the government's obligations. But, as I have said, no contention on this head is open to the respondent on this record, as there is no plea to support it.\nThe respondent's contention based upon the fact that the statutes authorized a money subsidy without mentioning any amount besides saying that it should not exceed 35 cents per acre is, on the evidence, untenable. All the documents, their very payment sheets to the contractors all the orders in council, show that it was mutually always understood that the full amount of 35 cents per acre was the amount this company was entitled to when they optioned for the cash subsidy.\nIf this receipt for $6,500 I have alluded to establishes anything, it is that the government acknowledges that it had fixed at 35 cents per mile the cash subsidy authorized by the statutes, besides admitting its liability therefore.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014In my view the principal question involved in this appeal is as to the existence of a contract between the company and the Crown. If a contractual relationship existed between them the suppliants are entitled to their demand and if not the appeal must fail.\nIt is clear that when an Act of Parliament by a sup-ply bill or otherwise authorizes the Crown to appropriate public money or lands for any specific purpose, or to any particular individual or company, such an Act is facultative or permissive only. It of itself imposes no obligation on the Crown to make the appropriation, much less does il give to any one a legal right to demand it. To create such right there must be a subsequent actual appropriation by the Crown communicated to the person for whom it is intended and acceptance by him of the appropriation. There must in short, be a contract. Nor is it absolutely necessary that the contract be under seal or even in d writing. It may be created without writing, without spoken words even, its existence being sometimes conclusively proved solely by the acts or dealings of the parties involved.\nNow in the present case there was no formal contract executed between the government and the company by which the company became bound to build the railway and the government to pay the subsidy. It was admitted at the argument that at that time such was not the practice in the province of Quebec; formal contracts were never entered into in reference to the payment of provincial railway subsidies, although an express statute on the subject has since been passed. But notwithstanding the want of it in the present case, I have come to the conclusion that as a matter of fact there was an actual contract a contract completely performed by the company and capable of being enforced against the Crown. The salient facts which have led me to this conclusion Pare as follows: By 51 & 52 Vic. cap. 91, sec. 9, the lieutenant governor was authorized to grant a subsidy of 4,000 acres of land to the Hereford Railway Company for the purpose of aiding the construction of its railway, the length not to exceed 35 miles. By the same Act it was provided, in effect, that the governor and council might upon application of the company convent the land subsidy into a money subsidy, by paying a sum not exceeding 35 cents per acre when the subsidy should become due, and a like further subsidy when the lands were sold, the company to declare its option in favour of conversion within two years from the passing of the Act. This Act was passed in July, 1888, and afterwards on the 16th of July the following letter was sent from the public works department, the department charged by statute with the administration of railway subsidies, to the president of the company:\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS,\nGOVERNMENT RAILWAY OFFICE,\nQUEBEC 16th July, 1888.\nTo W. B. IVES Esq. Q.C. & M.P., Sherbrooke.\nSir,\u2014 In reply to your favour of the 13th instant, I beg to enclose you, at your request, a copy of the railway subsidies act passed at the last session of the Quebec legislature, and sanctioned on the 12th instant\nIn answer to your question: \" Whether it will be necessary for the directors of the Hereford Railway Company to pass a resolution d\u00e9clarions their option to take money instead of land, and notify the commissioner or if the former declaration will suflice;\" I beg to state that such additional resolution will not be required in toto and that the one actually in my hands coming from the International Railway Company, and declaring their option in favour of the conversion into money of the land subsidy granted to the Hereford branch, under the act 45 Vic. chap. 23, section 1, paragraph 0, for a distance of 30 miles will be sufficient to enable meto operate such conversion in favour of your company for that distance only. But it will be necessary that you should send me a certified copy of a resolution passed by the board of directors of your company declaring their option in favour of the conversion of the additional land subsidy granted you by section 9 of the railway subsidies act, passed at the last session (bill 192) for the additional length of 5 miles in excess of the 30 miles already subsidized. As soon as I shall be in possession of this last copy of resolution, I will get an order in council passed for the purpose of approving the declarations of option so made, as well by the International Railway Company as by your own, in such away as to entitle your company to receive the full converted land subsidy according to law.\nAs I have told you in my office in the course of last week, I will be ready to issue instructions to the government engineer to get his inspection and report on any competed section of the Hereford Railway as soon as the honorable the commissioner of public works shall have received due communication therefore from the president or secretary of your company. When such a report is made by the engineer, an order in council will be passed to authorize your company to receive from the treasurer here, the proportion of said converted land subsidy, which your company may be entitled to, under such report and in virtue of the laws in force.\nI have the honour to be sir\nYour obedient servant,\nE. MOREAU,\nDirector of Railways. As suggested in that letter, in the same month the following resolution was passed by the company's directors:\nMoved by director Pope seconded by director Learned and resolved; \" That whereas by an act \"passed at the session of the legislature of the Province of Quebec held in the present year of our Lord 1888 a subsidy of four thousand acres of land per mile was voted to the Hereford Railway Company, for their railway, for a distance not exceeding thirty-five miles, and provision was made in the same Act for the conversion of such subsidy into a money subsidy, and whereas, under the said Act it is necessary that the option of the Hereford Railway Company in favour of such conversion should be declared by resolution of the board of directors the directors hereby declare 'their option and that of the Hereford Railway Company in favour of the conversion of the said subsidy into a money subsidy under the provisions of and in accordance with the said act\nThis resolution being communicated to the government of Quebec an order in council was passed of which the following is a copy:\nL'honorable commissaire des travaux publics dans un rapport en date du vingt-six juillet dernier 1883, expose: qu'il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 parles clauses 9 et 10 de l'acte relatif aux subventions des chemins de fer sanctionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re session de la l\u00e9gislature\nQu'il est loisible au lieutenant gouverneur en conseil d'accorder \u00e0 la Compagnie du chemin de fer de Hereford, une subvention de quatre mulle acres de terre par mille, pour une ligne de chemin de fer partant d'une jonction avec le chemin de fer de Boston, Concord et Montr\u00e9al, ou tout autre chemin de fer sur la fronti\u00e8re de la Province de Quebec \u00e0 dix mulles du ruisseau Hall, et se prolongeant \u00e0 une jonction avec le chemin de fer International, dans le canton d'Eaton, pourvu que la longeur de ce chemin de fer n'exc\u00e8de pas trente-cinq milles;

August the department of public works sent this order in council to the company accompanied by the following letter: \u2014\nDEPARTMENT OF POBLIC WORKS\nPARLIAMENT BUILDINGS,\nQUEBEC, 6th August, 1888.\nTo W. B. Ives, Esq., Q.C., M.P.,\nSherbrooke.\nSIR,\u2014Agreeably to your request I beg to enclose you herewith copy of an order in council sanctioned under no. 481 by his honour the lieutenant governor on the 2nd of August instant, and by which the declaration of the option made by the International and the Hereford Railway Companies in favour of the conversions into money of the land subsidy granted by the act 45 Vic, chap. 23, section 1, paragraph o and subsequently by the railway subsidies act of 1888, section 6, to the railway therein described, for a distance not exceeding 35 miles, have been ratified and confirmed by the executive council to all intents and purposes. It remains now with the Hereford Company to ' deposit into this department (railway office) a duplicate plan and book of reference of the constructed as well as of the projected line of their railway as described in the above last mentioned statute, the whole in accordance with section 8 of the Quebec consolidated railway act of 1880; said plan and book of reference will be examined here and if found correct and identical one with the other they will be duly certified and a copy thereof will be sent back to the president or secretary of the company, to he deposited in the registry office of the county traversed by said railway. According to law a similar certified copy of said plan and book of reference must be made at the cost of the company and deposited by them in each county through which passes the railway. When such deposit shall have been so made we will be ready at the request of the president or secretary of the company to send our engineer on the spot to inspect and report upon the extent and value of the works already done on said railway, provided the length of the completed portion thereof should not be less than 10 miles\nI have the honour to be sir\nYour obedient servant,\nE. MOREAU,\nDirector of Railways.\nSo far there may not be sufficent evidence of a contract, but there is surely a near approach to it. There is an act of the Crown subsequent to the act of the legislature indicating an intention on the part of the governor in council to act upon his statutory authority and to give a money subsidy, and to give it to this company. There is a written statement communicated to the company by the properly qualified government department to the effect that the order in council would \" entitle the company to receive the full converted land subsidy according to law \" and that upon inspection and approval of the work by the government engineer an order in council would be passed authorizing payment of such portions of the subsidy as might from time to time be earned. There is a further statement from the same public department suggesting to the company to prepare a plan and book of reference under the provisions of the railway Act of 1880, and that subsequently government officers would perform their statutory duties in the matter of inspection, and that too for the purpose, the only purpose, of enabling the company to receive its subsidy. So far there was no suggestion, not the scintilla of a suggestion that a written contract was necessary that a formal order in council should be passed authorizing the minister of public works to enter into a formal contract providing for the construction of the works or the payment of the subsidy. Had the question been raised, had this course been deemed necessary, doubtless it would have been done hut it never had been done; it had never been imagined in the administration of Quebec affairs that it was necessary to be done. What was done so far, amounted at least to this: an invitation by the government that the company should proceed with its work, and a promise that it should eventually obtain (all conditions being performed) the statutory subsidy.\nActing upon the belief that nothing further remained to be done in the matter of legal instruments, or formal contracts, the company made its surveys, prepared and duly filed its plan and books of reference of the line of railway had these plans and books approved in the usual way by the public works department, expended its money (exceeding I doubt not a hundred thousand dollars) in the construction and completion of the work, thoroughly finished it, had it finally inspected, examined and approved by the proper officer of the Quebec government, and, as stated by Mr. Moreau, director of railways, in his evidence, complied with all the conditions of the law in order to entitle itself to the subsidy (\" La compagnie s'est-elle conform\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les conditions de la loi pour se mettre en droit de recevoir sa subvention ?\") and it was so declared in the order of the governor in council of the 31st of July 1890.\nDuring the progress of the work, however, serious difficulty arose. The contractors who at an early stage were engaged upon it after receiving some $30,000 from the company, following several notable precedents in other parts of Canada, absconded without paying the labourers and other persons having dealings with them. There was of course great public dissatisfaction and the usual application to government for redress-A commissioner was thereupon appointed by the gov- ernment, Mr. J. P. Noyes, who made a report as to the actual amount due to the contractors' creditors, that indebtedness being determined by him to amount to the sum of $39297.0. That indebtedness, it must be observed, was in no way a liability of the company. so frar as the evidence goes there was no legal or even moral claim against the company. But some scheme must be devised to meet the difficulty and settle discontent in the eastern townships. The scheme was an easy one\u2014pay the labourers from the public exchequer, and charge the money, as well as all the expenses of the commission, against the company's subsidy. That was the mode adopted and put in execution. And it is for us to determine whether as between the government and the company, that payment was legal.\nThese payments were all made under orders in council from time to time the order for the payment of the principal sum being that of the 24th of December 1889 the warrant therefore being as follows '.\u2014\nBy His Honour\nThe Honorable Auguste-R\u00e9al Angers,\nLieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec.\nNo. 1675. $36,208.34.\nTo the Honourable the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec.\nYou are hereby authorized and required, out of such moneys as are in or shall come to your hands for defraying the expenses of the civil government of the Province of Quebec, to pay or cause to be paid unto\nThe Hereford Railway Company, represented by the hon.' commissioner of public works or to their assigns, the sum of thirty-six thousand two hundred and eight dollars and thirty-four cents, being to carry out the provisions of O.

And for so doing, this, with acquaintance of the said railway company, or their assigns, shall be to you a sufficient warrant and dis-charge.\nGUSTAVE GRENIER,\nDeputy Lieutenant Governor.\nQuebec, this 27th day of December, 1889.\nReceived this 16th day of January, 1890, from the honourable the treasurer, the above mentioned sum by three cheques, viz., $36,131.49, favour Honourable P. Garneau, comm. of public works, $16.85 favour L. A. Vall\u00e9e, and $60 favour assistant treasurer.\nP. GARNEAU,\nCommissioner Public Works.\nIt will be noted that in this, warrant as in most of the other ones, it is stated that the payment is to the company, but the company represented by the commissioner of public works. Now, it must be admitted that the honourable commissioner was not the representative or agent of the company. The company never authorized this payment, it always repudiated the charging of the money in question against its subsidy, and the commissioner had no semblance of right to take the money as the agent of the company. The orders in council, too, contain words intimating\" that the payments are to the company. They further indicate the amount of the subsidy, that it is to be upon the basis of 35 cents per mile Of the original land grant. Look at this warrant under which the sum of $6,500 was paid direct to the company and see what admissions are contained in it\nBy His Honour\nThe Honourable Auguste-R\u00e9al Angers,\nLieutenant Governor of. the Province of Quebec.\nNo. 511 on No. 1010. $6500.\nTo the Honourable the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec:\nYou are hereby authorized and required, out of such moneys as are in, or shall come to your hands, for defraying the expenses of the civil government of Quebec to pay or cause to be paid unto\nThe Hereford Railway Company, or to their assigns the sum of six thousand five hundred dollars being? on account of the balance of the first 35 cents per acre of converted land subsidy of 4,000 acres per mile on 35 miles, under O. C. no. 340 of July 31st, 1890. and chargeable to consolidated railway fund\nRailway subsidies, to be taken from 40 Victoria, chap. 2. And for so doing this, with the acquittance of the said Railway Co., or their assigns, shall be to you a sufficient warrant and discharge.\nQuebec, this 7th day of August, 1890.\nGUSTAVE GRENIER,\nDeputy Lieutenant Governor.\nReceived this 8th day of August 1890 from the honourable treasurer the above mentioned sum.\nTHE HEREFORD RAILWAY CO.\np. pro. W. B. IVES,\nPresident\nIt is there, I think, \"unquestionably admitted by the lieutenant governor himself the immediate and direct representative of the sovereign in all purely provincial affairs as decided by the Privy Council in the Mari-time Bank Case ([16]) that the company is entitled to a railway subsidy, that this subsidy has been converted from land to money that it was to be calculated at the rate of 35 cents per acre (a question perhaps debatable until then) and that the whole 35 cents per acre had been fully earned. Reading the warrant with the order in council upon which it was based and these conclusions become inevitable. I may here in a word dispose at once of the contention that the receipt above set out, given by the president of the company, is a full and final acquittance of the government's liability. It is the very reverse It is an admission that there is a \"balance \" still due and that the $6,500 is paid on account of that balance.\nIn my judgment the facts set out, and I have not gone into the details as fully as I might, lead to the conclusion that there was what in law must be deemed to be a contract between the government and the company. As already suggested, agreement or no agree-ment is a question of evidence. Speaking generally no rule as to mode of proof can be laid down. Each case must depend upon its own facts. In this case the evidence has satisfied me of the existence of the agreement and the consequent liability of the Crown.\nIt has been put forward that the orders in council and warrants to which I have referred, if they are to be considered in any way as evidence of an existing contract, must be taken with all qualifications or limitations therein expressed; that these instruments, if they are evidence of a contract between the government and the company at all must be deemed at the same time to be a declaration on the part of the government that it had a right to make payment as therein expressed. I do not so understand the law of evidence. That may be the case where the only evidence of the facts in issue are the documents produced but where for example in an action for work done and materials for the same provided, the plaintiff brings evidence to prove that the work was done and the materials were provided all of which the defendant in his evidence denies but at the same time the defendant's letter is put in evidence a letter in which he admits the doing of the work and the providing of the materials, but at the same time asserting that he had paid what was due, a jury would be justified in accepting his statement on the first point and rejecting it on the other. That is common sense as well as common law The human mind is so constituted that it cannot help believing the truth of an admission against interest, although rejecting at the same time some exculpatory or other asseveration coupled with it\nAnother point has been urged, viz., that the suppliants while admitting there was no contract contend that the government by its conduct is estopped from disputing it; and that there is no estoppel against the Crown. I do not propose to inquire whether in matters of contract there may not be estoppel against the Crown. That here is not the question. The question as already pointed out, is a matter of contract or no contract. Has the existence of a contract been proved? I have come to the conclusion that the course of dealing between the parties as shown in evidence has indubitably proved that it did exist. See Pollock on Contracts ([17]).\nThere is one other ground upon which the Crown succeeded in the courts below, viz., that the company by its president has exonerated the government under the following circumstances. On 20th January, 1890, after the subsidy in question had been earned (if earned at all), and the company had been pressing for its payment, Mr. Ives, the president, wrote to the Hon. Mr. Mercier, as \"premier \" of Quebec asking fora subsidy of $3,000 per mile upon 18 miles of road recently constructed, concluding his letter as follows:\nI have to add- that a subsidy of, say, three thousand dollars per mile upon this eighteen miles, voted on condition that the Government retained and paid out of it the claims against Messrs. Shirley, Corbett & Co. as established by Mr. John P. Noyes, would he acceptable to this company, and would put at rest all the difficulties that have arisen with regard to those claims.\nThis, of course, without prejudice to the claims and pretensions of the company, should this petition not be granted.\nThe legislature was then in session, closing on the 2nd of April following. Nothing was done at that session. In the following' session, however, an Act was passed by which it was made lawful to grant a subsidy.\nSec 1 To the Hereford Railway Company as assistance in the cost of building the extension of its line from its junction at Cookshire, to the place known as \"Lime Ridge,\" in the county of Wolfe, on a length not exceeding 18 miles, a subsidy of $3,000 per mile, and not exceeding in all $4,000.\nThis subsidy the company was subsequently paid without reference to the letter of Mr. Ives of the 20th January, 1890. Now, there is no evidence on the part of the Crown that the subsidy was voted in consequence or by reason of the letter; there is no evidence that the legislature knew anything of it. Evidence (if admissible) might have been given; Mr., Mercier, or some official seized of the facts, might have been examined as to whether at all and if so in what way the letter was acted upon. Mr. Ives himself a witness for the Crown, testified that his proposition was not accepted or acted upon, or made a condition to the granting of the subsidy, and there is not a word of testimony the other way unless what may be gathered from the subsidy Act itself and it, I think, points to the opposite conclusion. I do not adopt the argument that Mr. Ives acted without authority in writing the letter. If, after having written it, the legislature had acted upon it, granted the subsidy subject to the conditions mentioned in it and the company had afterwards received the money then it would be out of the question for the company to set up want of authority on his part. But the statute itself shows that it was not granted on the conditions stated by Mr. Ives. Absolute power in the matter was left with the executive; they could grant or withhold as they thought fit. If Mr. Ives's letter was considered binding it was their duty to see that the condition was inserted in the order in council or agreement under which the company obtained the second subsidy. Besides, as I understand it, the rules of legal draughtsman ship require that if there are conditions under which a statutory power of granting money is to be exercised these conditions must be expressed in the statute itself not left to be afterwards found out by oral or other testimony. And therefore, as a general rule, evidence is properly inadmissible upon grounds of public policy, for the purpose of showing the reasons or conditions or influences that moved parliament or members of parliament in passing particular enactments. The statute itself must speak.\nI conclude, therefore, that the defence in the case has wholly failed, and that the suppliant company is entitled to be paid the balance of the subsidy, together \"with interest from the date of the last order in council mentioned, with costs of the appeal in the courts below.\nKING J. concurred with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be dismissed\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitor for respondent : F.

Many years before that a drain had been constructed through this property by the Imperial authorities, the existence of which was not known to the officers of the Dominion Government, and it was not discovered at an examination of the premises in 1880 by the city engineer of Quebec and others. Before 1877 this drain had become choked up, and the water escaping gradually loosened the earth until in 1889, a large portion of the rock fell from the cliff into a street of the city below, causing great damage for which compensation was claimed from the Government.\nHeld, per Taschereau, Gwynne, and King JJ., affirming the decision of the Exchequer Court, that as the injury to the property of the city did not occur upon a public work, subsec. (c) of the above Act did not make the Crown liable, and, moreover, there was no evidence that the injury was caused by the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nHeld, per Strong Q.J. and Fournier J., that while subsec. (c) of the Act did not apply to the case, the city was entitled to relief under subsec. (d); that the words \u201cany claim against the Crown\u201d in that subsec, without the additional words would include a claim for a tort; that the added words \u201carising under any law of Canada\u201d do not necessarily mean any prior existing law ot statute law of the Dominion, but might be interpreted as meaning the general law of any province of Canada and even if the meaning be restricted to the statute law of the Dominion the effect of sec. 58 of 50 & 51 V. c. 16 is to reinstate the provision contained in s. 6 of the repealed Act R.S.C. c. 40 which gives a remedy for injury to property in a case like the present; that this case should be decided according to the law. of Quebec, regulating the rights and duties of proprietors of land situated on different levels; and that under such law the Crown, as proprietor of land on the higher level, was bound to keep the drain thereon in good repair and was not relieved from liability, for damage caused by neglect to do so by the ignorance of its officers of the existence of the drain.\nHeld also, per Strong C.J. and Fournier J., that independently of the enlarged jurisdiction conferred by 50 & 51 V. c. 16 the Crown would be liable to damages for the injury complained of not as for a tort but for a breach of its duty as owner of the superior heritage by altering its natural state to the injury of the inferior proprietor.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] granting a motion on behalf of the Crown for a nonsuit.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and the judgments published herewith. The Chief Justice in his judgment also points out the grounds relied on by counsel in argument.\nPelletier Q.C. and Flynn Q.C. for the appellant.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a petition of right by which the city of Quebec seeks to recover from the Crown reparation for the damage caused by an accident which took place on the 19th September, 1888, when a large portion of rock fell from the side of Cape Diamond into Champlain Street, in the Lower Town of that city, breaking into pieces and forming an enormous heap by which the street was blocked up for a considerable length, and communication between the northerly and southerly ends of it rendered impossible, and whereby the water pipes and drains belonging to the city were covered over and rendered inaccessible. A demurrer by the Crown having been overruled, the petition of right came on for hearing before the judge of the Exchequer Court, who, at the close of the suppliant\u2019s case, ordered judgment of non-suit to be entered from which judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nOne of the principal questions to be decided by this appeal is the extent of the remedy by petition of right, which depends on the construction to be placed on two Acts of Parliament.\nBefore the passing of the Petitions of Right Act, 39 Vic. ch. 27, there was no remedy against the Crown as representing the Dominion of Canada, in any dominion or provincial court, in respect of any act or omission on the part of the Crown, or any of its officers or servants, which in the case of a subject would have entailed liability as being a tortious act or a negligent omission of duty, save in so far as by statute (hereafter referred to) power was given to certain ministers of the Crown, being heads of departments, in their discretion to refer claims for relief in such matters to the arbitration of public officers, called \u201cofficial arbitrators.\u201d\nThe Petitions of Right Act did not confer any remedy in such a case, for by the 19th section of Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 136, sec. 21, it was enacted that: Nothing in this Act contained shall give to the subject any remedy against the Crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England under similar circumstances by the laws in force there prior to the passing of an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed in the 23rd and 24th years of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, intituled \u201cAn Act to amend the law relating to Petitions of Right, to simplify the proceedings and to make provision for the costs thereof.\u201d\nThat the law of England did not authorize a petition of right as a remedy for a tortious act alleged against the Crown, or its officers or servants, is a proposition scarcely requiring any authority. The cases of Lord Canterbury v. The Attorney General[2]; Tobin v. The Queen[3]; and Feather v. The Queen[4], may be referred to as establishing it beyond a doubt or question. That the Petitions of Right Act did not alter the law in this respect was held in The Queen v. McLeod[5], and The Queen v. McFarlane[6], which are conclusive authorities for that proposition binding on this court. If therefore the present appellant is now entitled to a judicial remedy against the Crown in respect of a delict or tort such remedy, and the jurisdiction to enforce it, must have been conferred since the decision of the last of the two cases referred to. In order to ascertain whether this is so or not it is necessary to examine with care the subsequent legislation which is relied on by the appellant as having so altered the law, and also to notice some prior enactments referred to in such subsequent legislation.\nBy the 6th section of chapter 40 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting Official Arbitrators,\u201d which was a consolidation and re-enactment of previous legislation, it was enacted as follows:\nIf any person has any claim for property taken, or for alleged direct or consequential damage to property arising from or connected with the construction, repair, maintenance, or working of any public work, or arising out of anything done by the government of Canada, or arising out of any death, or any injury to person or property on any public work, or any claim arising out of or connected with the execution or fulfilment, or an account of deductions made for the non-execution or non-fulfilment, of any contract made and entered into on behalf of Her Majesty, such person may give notice in writing of such claim to the Secretary of State, stating the particulars thereof, and how the same has arisen, which notice the Secretary of State shall refer to the head of the department with respect to which the claim has so arisen; and thereupon the minister may, at any. time within thirty days after such notice, tender what he considers a fair compensation for the same with notice that the said claim will be submitted to the decision of the arbitrators, unless the sum so tendered is accepted within ten days after such tender.\nI have set forth this long section in extenso, for although the statute itself is repealed it has, nevertheless, a very material bearing on the question of the Crown\u2019s liability.\nBy the same Act provision was made for the appointment of official arbitrators, for their powers and for the procedure on references before them.\nBy 50 & 51 Vict., ch. 16, by which the Exchequer Court, the jurisdiction of which up to that time had been administered by the judges of the Supreme Court, was re-constituted under a separate judge, with an enlarged and more fully defined jurisdiction, it was (by the 15th section) enacted that:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might, in England, be the subject of a suit or action against the Crown, and for greater certainty, but. not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or money of the subject are in the possession of the Crown; or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or: on behalf of: the Crown.\nThe 16th section is as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters: (a.) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose;\n(b.) Every claim against the Crown for damage to property, injuriously affected by the construction of any public work;\n(c.) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment;\n(d.) Every claim against the Crown arising under any law. of Canada or any regulation made by the governor in council.\nBy section 23 it is provided that:\nAny claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by petition of right, or may be referred to the court by the head of the department in connection with the administration of which the claim arises, and if any such claim is so referred no fiat shall be given on any petition of\u2019 right in respect thereof.\nBy section 58 of the same Act chapter 40 of the Revised Statutes of Canada was repealed, but expressly \u201csubject to the provisions of the Interpretation Act,\u201d and it was enacted that:\nWhenever in any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any order of the governor in council, or in any document, it is provided or declared that any matter may be referred to the official arbitrators acting under the \u201cAct respecting the Official Arbitrators,\u201d or that any powers shall be vested in or duty shall be performed by such arbitrators, such matters shall be referred to the Exchequer Court and such powers shall be vested in and such duties performed by it; and whenever the expression \u201cofficial arbitrators\u201d or \u201cofficial arbitrator\u201d occurs in any such Act, order or document, it shall be construed as meaning the Exchequer Court.\nUpon the argument of the demurrer in this case it was contended, on behalf of the Crown, that the effect of this legislation was to leave parties just where they were before the passing of the 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16; (the Exchequer Court Amendment Act) in respect of any right to recover against the Crown in respect of a tort, for the reason that it was not intended to confer any new or enlarged right to maintain a petition of right against the Crown in the matter of such claims, but merely to enact that wherever there was a previous liability of the Crown in respect of the matters referred to in section 16, that liability might be enforced by a reference to the Exchequer Court instead of to the official arbitrators. And in support of this proposition the case of Northcote v. The Owners of the Henrich Bj\u00f6rn[7] was relied on. That case, however, does not seem to have any application. Jurisdiction was there given to the Court of Admiralty in certain new cases, and the question was whether this necessarily implied that a maritime lien was thereby conferred. It was held that the only effect of the Act was to enable a liability in personam, which before had existed at common law, to be enforced in the Admiralty. This manifestly has no application here.\nThis objection was overruled by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, and I am of opinion that in this his decision was correct.\nThe right of the city of Quebec to relief in respect of the grievances alleged in the petition of right depends on subsection (d) of section 16 of the Exchequer Court Act and not oil subsection (c) of the same section 16, the last subsection being for several reasons inapplicable to the case before us. This subsection (d) which gives jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court to hear and determine \u201cevery claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada\u201d would indubitably and upon the direct authority of two; recent decisions of the Privy Council, if the words \u201cunder any law of Canada\u201d were eliminated, have the effect of giving a remedy to the subject against the Crown in all claims for damages for torts or delicts. In the case of Farnell v. Bowman[8], an appeal from New South Wales, it was held that the, government, of that colony was liable to be sued in an action ex delicto under a statute providing \u201cthat any person having or deeming himself to have any just claim or demand whatever against the government\u201d might set forth the same in a petition to the governor, upon which petition a certain prescribed procedure being followed, judicial relief might be obtained as in the case of an ordinary action between subject and subject. In this judgment it is said with reference to the proper construction of the statute:\u2014\nThus, unless the plain words are to be restricted for any good reason, a complete remedy is given to any person having or deeming himself to have any just claim or demand whatsoever against the government. These words are amply sufficient to include a claim for damages for a tort committed by the local government by their servants.\nIn the case of the Atty. Gen. of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[9], the words of an ordinance authorizing a remedy by petition of right against the Crown for tortious Acts was in words even more apposite to the case before us; these words were:\u2022\nAny claim against the Crown for damages or compensation arising in the colony shall be a claim cognizable under this ordinance.\nThe Judicial Committee in their judgment make the following observations upon the meaning of this provision:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the expression \u201cclaim against the Crown for damages or compensation\u201d is an apt expression to include claims arising out of torts, and that as claims arising out of contracts and other classes of claims are expressly mentioned, the words ought to receive their full meaning. In the case of Farnell v. Bowman[10], attention was directed by this committee to the fact that in many colonies the Crown was in the habit of undertaking works which in England are usually performed by private persons, and to the consequent expediency of providing remedies for injuries committed in the course of these works. The present case is an illustration of that remark. And there is no improbability, but the reverse, that when the legislature of a colony in such circumstances allows claims against the Crown in words applicable to claims upon torts, it should mean exactly what it expresses. These two cases have a two-fold application here, first as showing that the words \u201cany claim against the Crown\u201d are sufficiently comprehensive to include torts, more especially as the 15th section makes express provision for the case of claims arising from contracts; secondly, these judgments of the Privy Council lay down a rule or canon for the construction of colonial enactments by which the remedy of the subject against the Crown is enlarged, which it is the duty of this court to apply, as far as possible, to the acts of parliament now under consideration.\nIt being then established by the cases cited that the language of section 16, subsection (d) \u201cevery claim against the Crown\u201d is to have the wide construction before stated applied to it, which would include claims for damages arising ex delicto, we are next to inquire whether any and what restriction on the meaning which would be thus attributable to the expression in question, if it had stood alone, is imposed by the words \u201carising under any law of Canada,\u201d which immediately follow. It may be said that these are words of limitation which confine the clause to claims in respect of which some pre-existing law had imposed a liability on the part of the Crown. Again, it may be said that a \u201claw of Canada\u201d necessarily means not only some prior law of Canada, but must also exclusively refer to statute law. In support of this last proposition it might be said that there is no general common law prevailing throughout the Dominion of Canada, that each of the several provinces possesses its own private common-law, and that the common law of the territories not included within any of the provinces depends on the enactments of the Dominion Parliament. This may be true, and is a necessary incident and result under every system of federal government where the several provinces or states forming the confederation have each its own separate and different system of private law. This has been recognized as a necessary consequence under the federal constitution of the United States, and that for a reason which would be equally applicable to Canada. It can make no difference that all the provinces, save one, derive their common law from that of England; the circumstance that the private law of one province, that of Quebec, is derived from a different source, makes it impossible to say that there is any system of law, apart from statute, generally prevalent throughout the Dominion. No inconvenience can result from this, since every ease which could arise would be provided for by the law of some one or other of the provinces.\nWere I obliged to determine this question of construction as one on which the decision of this appeal depended I should probably come to the conclusion that the clause in question ought not to be so interpreted as to exclude claims in respect of torts and delicts, not referable to any prior statute of the Dominion, but being such as would, under the law of any of the provinces of Canada, have entitled parties to relief as between subject and subject. Taking the rule so clearly and emphatically laid down by the Privy Council in the cases before cited as a guide which we are bound to follow, it would appear to be proper that a wide and liberal construction, what is called a beneficial construction, should be placed upon the language of the legislature; a construction calculated to advance the rights of the subject by giving him an extended remedy. Proceeding upon this principle, we should, I think, be required to say that it was not intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some pre-existing liability of the Crown, but that it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown which, according to the existing general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognizable by the courts. Further, I am of opinion that it would be right to hold that the words \u201claw of Canada\u201d did not mean exclusively a statute of the Dominion of Canada, but might be interpreted as meaning the law of any province of Canada which would have been appropriate for the decision of a particular claim in respect of a tort or delict if it had arisen between subjects of the Crown. It would not, I think, be taking any unwarrantable liberty with the language of the legislature so to interpret the words \u201cany law of Canada,\u201d for in a non-technical and popular sense the laws of the several provinces of Canada are laws of Canada, and the rule laid down by the cases before cited requires us to give the terms used the most favourable and comprehensive construction possible. Granting, however, that this subsection (d) of section 16 is to be construed as literally and narrowly as possible, and that it is to be confined to cases of claims arising under some pre-existing law; and further that such pre-existing law must be a law of Canada which shall be an act of parliament of the Dominion; my proposition is that a remedy to be obtained through the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is conferred on the subject by this subsection (d) of section 16 for a claim such as the present.\nSection 6 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 40, before set forth, gives in the most explicit terms a remedy to be attained by means of the administrative procedure thereby prescribed, for any direct or consequential damage to property arising from or connected with the construction, repair, maintenance or working of any public work, or arising out of anything done by the government of Canada. If this enactment, or that particular portion of it to which I have just referred, still remains in force, it is clear that there is an existing law of Canada which authorizes the claim against the Crown made by the suppliant in this petition of right. I now proceed to show how this section 6 of chapter 40 is kept alive, notwithstanding the express repeal of the whole chapter 40 by section 58 of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16. In the beginning of section 58 it is provided that the Acts and parts of Acts mentioned in schedule B to the Act are thereby repealed, and in the schedule this chapter 40 is specified as wholly repealed; such repeal is, however, expressly made subject to the \u201cInterpretation Act.\u201d By the subsequent part of section 58 it is declared that wherever in any Act of Parliament it is provided that any matter may be referred to \u201cthe official arbitrators\u201d or \u201cthat when any powers shall be vested in or duty shall be performed by such arbitrators\u201d such matters shall be referred to the Exchequer Court, and such powers shall be vested in and duties performed by that court, and that wherever the expression \u201cofficial arbitrators\u201d occurs in any such Act it shall be construed as meaning the Exchequer Court. It follows from this that claims provided for by section 6 of the Revised Statutes, chapter 40, which by that Act were to be referred to the arbitrators, are now, under this Act 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, to be referred to the Exchequer Court, which necessarily implies that all such claims against the Crown are saved from the repeal and are therefore matters in which parties are for the future to be entitled to a remedy by the judicial procedure of the Exchequer Court. According to the section just quoted from, the matters so saved from the repeal of chapter 40 are to be referred to the Exchequer Court; from this, if it stood alone, it would follow that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court in such cases, could only be exercised upon a reference by a minister. By the 23rd section of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, it is, however, provided \u201cthat any claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by petition of right, or may be referred to the court\u201d by a minister; \u201cany claim\u201d of course would include a claim such as that made by the petition of right in the present case in respect of \u201cdirect or consequential damage to property\u201d under the sixth section of the Revised Statutes, ch. 40, as reinstated by section 58 of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16. Therefore not merely are such claims now the proper subject of reference to the Exchequer Court, but they may also be asserted by petition of right. This must follow not merely from the use of the comprehensive expression \u201cany claim\u201d but also from the latter part of section 23. This latter part of the section provides that \u201cif any claim is referred no fiat shall be given on any petition of right in respect thereof.\u201d This I construe as necessarily implying that claims which might have been referred may be properly the subject of petitions of right, thus indicating that the wide meaning which I have already attached to the words \u201cany claim\u201d in the preceding part of the section is in accord with the deliberate intention of the legislature. And this may well be considered not to be an extravagant concession on the part of the Crown in favour of claimants for reparation for torts or delicts, inasmuch as the power to grant or withhold the fiat on a petition of right enables the administrative officers of the Crown to exercise as much control over a remedy in that form as a minister could under the statute exercise in granting or refusing a reference.\nThe case made by the petition of right must then, for the foregoing reasons, be considered a claim against the Crown under subsection (d) of section 16 of the Exchequer Court Amendment Act arising under that particular law of Canada which is embodied in the reinstated section 6 of the repealed Act, Revised Statutes ch. 40. The claim is one within the purview of that section inasmuch as the suppliant complains of and claims damages for a direct and also a consequential injury to its property, or to the street which it was bound to keep and maintain as a thoroughfare, by blocking it up with a heap of rock, stones and earth which also covered its water and drainage pipes, thus preventing access to the pipes in case of leakage, which damage the suppliant says is proved to have arisen from or in connection with the construction, repair and maintenance of a public work, namely, a certain drain, running through the property of the Crown. It is true that the allegations of the petition of right are very general, merely alleging carelessness, want of precaution and gross negligence on the part of the Crown and its officers. But no objection was taken to this general form of pleading, either at the trial or upon the appeal to this court, and I therefore feel justified in putting the case as it was shaped in argument by the appellant\u2019s counsel at this bar, and as it was disclosed by the evidence which was admitted without objection. It being then sufficiently established that the suppliant was rightly before the Exchequer Court on a petition of right, the next question is: In what system of law is the rule of decision applicable to the case so presented to be found? So long as such a claim, was one at large to be referred to lay arbitrators under the administrative procedure prescribed by the repealed Act, it might not matter that it should be brought under any particular system of law, but where it was made a matter for judicial decision, as it was by the transfer of the jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court, it became necessary to ascertain by what rules of law the suppliant\u2019s case was to be determined. The decision of the case must of course be regulated either by the law of the province of Quebec as expressed in the civil code, and by the old French law by which the code is supplemented, or by the law of England, these being of course the only systems to which resort can properly be had for a rule of decision. As both the property of the suppliant alleged to have received the injury, and the property of the Crown from which the damage proceeded, are in the province of Quebec, I think there can be no question but that the proper rule of decision is that afforded by the law of that province. It matters, however, in my opinion, but little whether the law of England or the law of the province of Quebec be applied to this case, as in all material respects the two systems of law are identical in the principles applicable to the facts disclosed by the evidence in the present record.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court was of opinion that neither misfeasance nor negligence on the part of the Crown or any of its officers was proved. What the learned judge said on this head is contained in the following paragraph, which I extract from his judgment:\nWith reference to this question of nonfeasance I agree with the view which Mr. Hogg and Mr. Cook put forward, that no officer of the Crown is under any duty to repair or to add to a public work at his own expense, or unless the Crown has placed at his disposal money or credit with instructions to execute the repairs or. the addition.\nIn that sense there is no evidence here of any [officer who was charged with any such duty, and being so charged neglected to perform his duty. The truth of the matter is with regard to the drain that no one knew of its existence until after this accident had occurred and minute inquiry was made into its causes. And it seems to me that the suppliant must fail, unless there was some officer or servant of the Crown whose duty it was to know of the existence of this drain, of its choking up and to report the fact to the government, and who was negligent in being and remaining in ignorance of the drain and of the defect. Upon this view of the evidence the learned judge stopped the case at the end of the suppliant\u2019s evidence, and without hearing any evidence in defence ordered judgment to be entered for the Crown. So far as proof of any misfeasance on the part of the Crown, or negligence on the part of any particular officer of the Crown charged with any duty in respect of the lands of the Crown from which this landslide took place, is requisite to make out the suppliant\u2019s case, I agree that no such misfeasance or negligence was proved. I am of opinion, however, that the suppliant\u2019s evidence does show a prim\u00e2 facie case of nonfeasance on the part of the Crown which under the 6th and 7th paragraphs of the petition it was open to the suppliant to prove, and at all events such a case as would upon an amendment of the petition have entitled the suppliant to relief in the absence of any contradictory evidence on the part of the Crown.\nIn the judgment delivered in the Exchequer Court there occurs the following passage:\nThe accident so far as the evidence goes was occasioned, or at least hastened, by the discharge of the water from the drain which has been so much spoken of.\nI have read the evidence several times and attentively considered it, and I entirely agree that this is on the whole a proper conclusion from it, although I might be induced to put it a little stronger and say that in the present state of the record it appears from the evidence that this drain was the sole and immediate cause of the disastrous accident which has led to the present claim.\nI do not propose to deal with the evidence exhaustively or with any degree of fulness, as in the event of the case being sent down to another trial such a discussion might lead to embarrassment; but in order to make what I have to say as regards the non-suit plain, I must refer to it to some slight extent. In the deposition of Mr. Baillairg\u00e9, a civil engineer, and the city engineer of Quebec, a witness whose evidence seems to have commended itself to the learned judge as entirely worthy of credit (which, however, is not now material since on this appeal against the nonsuit we have nothing to do with the credibility of witnesses or the weight of testimony) I find the following description of the accident itself, and of the causes which led to it:\nQ. You remember the 19th September, 1889, the evening of the catastrophe?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Will you in a few words, state what occurred and how it occurred, that landslide?\u2014A. Well, what occurred was that the whole section of rock between the outer and inner crevasses moved forward about between six and seven inches, moved outwards with the terrace, taking the terrace with it, about two hundred feet of the western end of the terrace. The floor of it had been scribed to the rock, and it still can be seen, the scribing to the rock. It will be seen now that this is six inches at its greatest amplitude and going upward diminishes off to five, four and two inches, showing that the whole cliff moved away; and another point that shows it is the stairs reaching up to the citadel, on the second landing of the stairs the ramps are dislocated, are torn asunder about seven inches so there is no doubt the whole cliff with the terrace moved outwards about six inches; and this section thrust out the other. The present section on which the terrace is built, by pushing out have the other a push and caused it to fall over. That is my idea. The outer face of the section there at present leans over six feet in sixty or one in ten, and as the crevasse was about two feet, therefore the rear part of the rock must have leaned over about eight feet, making it very unstable the portion that fell.\nQ. When it comes there what direction does the water take, does it go into a sewer or drain?\u2014A. Yes, it now takes a direction parallel to the riprap wall on the face of the glacis. This is since last fall when the drain was renewed. It is indicated here on suppliant\u2019s exhibit no. 9 by the letters A, F, G, H. The portion A, P, is parallel to the foot of the glacis, A, F, G, H, running out down over the cliff towards the St. Lawrence. That was a drain built for the water, I don\u2019t know how many years ago, perhaps fifty years ago, and it was completely choked at the time of the landslide; but it was burst out here just near the bastion, and any water flowing out from it, instead of flowing down the drain, poured out from the side of the brick drain and naturally ran towards and into the crevasse. By the court:\nQ. The upper crevasse?\u2014A. The inner crevasse, the present crevasse.\nQ. All that water had to come and go into the sewer and drain which went parallel to the riprap wall?\u2014A. Yes, it would have come down that drain and followed the face of the cliff and gone down into Champlain street, but the drain was choked.\nQ. You say you found that drain choked somewhere?\u2014A. Yes, the drain was choked, completely choked, at point A on exhibit no. 9.\nQ. You do not say it was choked there, you say that all the water came out from there?\u2014A. All the way down from the point A it was choked, it was all filled, completely filled from the debris falling into it.\nQ. You found that drain choked?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Well, where had the water to go?\u2014A. Well, there was a hole in the side of the brick drain which was only four inches thick, half brick thick.\nQ. On which side?\u2014A. The outer side, the side towards the river.\nQ. By what you saw, Mr. Baillairg\u00e9, is there any appearance that this drain was choked lately or long ago?\u2014A. It must have been choked, according to appearances, I should say for more than twenty years. It was very solidly packed, solidly packed with earth and stones to the very summit of the arch. I don\u2019t think a drop of water could pass through.\nQ. So it had to run down into the crevasse?\u2014A. Yes, it had to run into the crevasse.\nQ. Which is immediately under that?\u2014A. Yes, the crevasse is immediately under that or opposite.\nQ. That drain was built long ago, I suppose?\u2014A. I suppose at the time the citadel was finished, some fifty or sixty years ago.\nQ. That sewer was made to drain the citadel?\u2014A. Yes, evidently made to drain the waters from the ditches of the citadel.\nQ. Mr. Baillairg\u00e9, in the whole of your evidence this morning, the conclusion was that you attributed the fall of the rock to the extra quantity of water coming from the citadel and which did not pass through the sewer?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. You have no doubt about it?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Have you any doubt that if that drain which was choked had not been choked, that the water which drained from the citadel would not have gone into the crevasse?\u2014A. Certainly not; it would have run eastward.\nQ. And you have no doubt that the natural quantity of rainfall which went directly into the crevasse would not have been sufficient in pressure to push the rock out?\u2014A. No. Q. It would have been impossible?\u2014A. It would not have exercised the necessary pressure.\nNow, I think after this evidence it was impossible to say that there was no proof in support of the suppliant\u2019s claim as it was put forward in argument here, and as it has been propounded in the appellant\u2019s factum. It is sufficiently proved for the purpose of a prim\u00e2 facie case that the landslide in question was caused by a drain which had been constructed when the works of the citadel of Quebec had been completed by the Imperial Government, some sixty years before the accident, haying become completely blocked so that it did not after a certain length carry off any water; that it. had probably been in this condition for some twenty years previously; that the stopping up of this drain caused the water which ought to have been carried away by it to escape through a hole in the drain caused by its bursting and to spread over the adjacent rock and into certain crevasses of that rock which eventually led to the loosening of the earth and caused the rock to slide forward, which in turn pushed down the huge mass which fell into the street to the lamentable destruction of human life and private and public property before described.\nIf on a proper application of principles of law to this statement of the facts which I am of opinion was the result of the evidence, the suppliant was entitled to relief, the non-suit was wrong, and the Crown ought to have been called upon to proceed with its evidence in answer to the prim\u00e2 facie case thus established. I have been particular to point out that the defect in the drain, and probably the existence of the drain itself, was not known to any of the officers of the Crown before the accident, and that there was nothing to indicate its existence which would have made it negligence in them not to have known it, for two reasons, first, because the learned judge lays stress on this which in point of fact he is entirely justified in doing; secondly, because so far as the case depended in any way on proof of negligence this non-negligent ignorance of the existence of the drain would, on the authority of The Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[11], be a conclusive answer.\nI now proceed to put forward the propositions of law which, applied to the conclusion from the evidence I have just stated, seem to me to show that a case calling for an answer from the Crown was sufficiently made out by the suppliant. I am of opinion that according to the law of the province of Quebec, if the land from which the mass of earth and rock which fell upon the suppliant\u2019s streets was detached had been the property of a subject, the city could, under the facts and circumstances established by the evidence, have maintained an action against such proprietor in order to obtain reparation for the damages thus caused. Therefore, under the statutes already referred to there does exist a claim against the Crown which is under the latter statute the proper subject of a petition of right. The principles of law which govern the case are those which regulate the rights and duties of proprietors of land situated on different levels, and these principles are formulated as applicable to one of the many instances in which they apply, by article 501 of the civil code of Quebec. This article is as follows:\nLands on a lower level are subject towards those on a higher level to receive such waters as flow from the latter naturally and without the agency of man. The proprietor of the lower land cannot raise any dam to prevent this flow. The proprietor of the higher land can do nothing to aggravate the servitude of the lower land.\nArticle 501 is a literal reproduction of article 640 of the French Code. All the commentators on the Code Napol\u00e9on recognize that article 640 is but a single instance of the application of a general principle of law which is not confined to the case of the flowage of water from higher to lower lands belonging to different proprietors, but which is also applicable to the case of earth, rock and stone falling or sliding down from the superior upon the inferior of properties owned by several proprietors. Demolombe[12] says:\nL\u2019article 640 n\u2019est relatif qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coulement des eaux, mais il est clair que les fonds inf\u00e9rieurs sont \u00e9galement assujettis \u00e0 recevoir les lavanges, les avalanches, les \u00e9boulements, enfin, de toutes sortes de terre, de neige, de glaces, de gravier, de rochers, etc., qui se d\u00e9tachent des fonds sup\u00e9rieurs. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une r\u00e8gle de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qui, pour n\u2019avoir point \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e dans un article sp\u00e9cial, n\u2019en est pas moins \u00e9vidente et dont l\u2019article 640 n\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019une application.\nC\u2019est donc d\u2019apr\u00e8s la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur telle que l\u2019article 640 la r\u00e9v\u00e8le et d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et du bon sens, que les magistrats doivent se d\u00e9cider dans les diff\u00e9rentes hypoth\u00e8ses qui peuvent se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et qui sont tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quentes dans les pays de montagnes.\n55. Ainsi, la premi\u00e8re condition est que les \u00e9boulements descendent naturellement des fonds sup\u00e9rieurs et sans que la main de l\u2019homme y ait contribu\u00e9; art. 640.\nPoint de doute, par exemple, que le propri\u00e9taire qui, par des travaux quelconques, aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame la pente du sol, ne f\u00fbt responsable des dommages qui en r\u00e9sulteraient pour ses voisins. (Zachari\u00e6 t. 1, p. 427).\nPothier also shows that the principle which was subsequently adopted in the code admits of a very wide generalization. This author, in treating of \u201cVoisinage,\u201d in the second appendix to his Trait\u00e9 de Soci\u00e9t\u00e9[13] says:\u2014\nLe voisinage oblige les voisins \u00e0 user chacun de son h\u00e9ritage de mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il ne nuise pas \u00e0 son voisin. Dig. 50-17-61 De Reg. Jur.\nCette r\u00e8gle doit s\u2019entendre en ce sens que quelque libert\u00e9 qu\u2019un chacun ait de faire ce que bon lui semble sur son h\u00e9ritage, il n\u2019y peut faire rien d\u2019o\u00f9 il puisse parvenir quelque chose sur l\u2019h\u00e9ritage voisin, qui lui soit nuisible, Dig. 8-5-8 Si. serv. vind. So long as the higher lands are left in their natural state and nothing is done by the owner of the superior heritage to cause the descent of water, rock, earth or other matter upon the inferior heritage, the proprietor of the latter cannot complain of the natural flowage of water or falling of earth, but if by any works of the superior proprietor upon his own land, water, rocks, stones or earth are caused to fall upon the lower property and damage is thereby caused, which, if things had been left in their natural state, would not have resulted, the proprietor of the inferior property is entitled to reparation.\nThus Demolombe says[14]:\nLe propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur n\u2019est pas tenu de r\u00e9parer le dommage que les \u00e9boulements auraient caus\u00e9 aux fonds inf\u00e9rieurs. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un de ces accidents de la nature dont nul n\u2019est responsable, toutes les fois, bien entendu, qu\u2019on ne lui impute d\u2019ailleurs aucune faute.\nMarcad\u00e9[15] commenting on article 640 C.N. says:\nSi c\u2019\u00e9tait par le fait du propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur, que les cailloux, des eaux, etc., descendissent sur le terrain inf\u00e9rieur le propri\u00e9taire de celui-ci ne serait plus oblig\u00e9 de les recevoir, car la loi n\u2019entend consacrer que le r\u00e9sultat naturel de la position des lieux.\nLaLaure has this passage[16]:\nLe propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur peut s\u2019opposer \u00e0 ce que le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur aggrave sa servitude par quelques travaux qui augmenteraient, \u00e0 son pr\u00e9judice, le volume des eaux et leur affluence; sa servitude \u00e9tant impos\u00e9e par la nature, il n\u2019est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir les eaux que dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 la nature les lui renvoie elle-m\u00eame.\nI also refer to Merlin[17], and to Baudry-Lacantinerie[18]. Two arr\u00eats referred to by Demolombe[19], are also much in point, as are also the observations of Aubry et Eau[20], and Laurent[21] upon this point. The streets of the city of Quebec are by C. S. C. ch. 85, secs. 1, 2 and 3 vested in the suppliant as to the right of user if not as to the property also, and must therefore be deemed to be in the possession of the suppliant who, by the enactment referred to, is bound to keep them in repair and is liable to indictment for neglect of such duty. That the city therefore was subjected to great damage from this landslide must be apparent when it is. considered that not only were the streets blocked up by the rock and earth which fell upon them, but the water pipes and drains belonging to the city were also covered by it and rendered inaccessible. That a public street or highway is to be regarded as a servient heritage for the purpose of the application of the article 501, is demonstrated very clearly and satisfactorily by Laurent[22] who shows that public ways, roads and streets are subject to the servitude recognized by the code and that consequently they are entitled to the benefit of the same limitations as regards abstinence from aggravation on the part of the dominant owner as applies to private proprietorship.\nIf the city is not entitled to relief by petition of right it is manifest it will have to suffer a great wrong without any corresponding remedy. The statute as already stated makes it incumbent on the corporation to maintain the streets and to keep them in good repair, and this of course involved the duty of clearing away the rock and rubbish which fell upon it on the occasion of this accident, thus burdening the city with a large expenditure. The failure of the suppliant to perform this duty would have left it liable to indictment. See The Queen v. Grcenhow[23]. Again, it was absolutely necessary to have the surface of the street cleared of this mass of rock and rubbish, in order that in case of need access might be obtained to the drains and water pipes, the latter being the property of the city. It is no answer to the claim of the city to be indemnified for the damage which it has thus suffered to say that the incumbrance of the street by the debris which fell from, the property of the Crown was in the nature of a public wrong, an obstruction of the highway which, if it had been wilfully caused by a subject, would have been a public nuisance, for in addition to that it was a special private wrong as regards the city, causing, the corporation special loss and damage apart altogether from the injury to the public caused by blocking up the street; for this wrong, as the suppliant is in possession of the street, is under the legal obligation to keep it in repair and open for traffic, and has, if not the full property, at least a jus in re by reason of its express statutory right of user, and also by reason of its water pipes and drains laid beneath the surface, it ought to be entitled to recover in this proceeding by petition of right.\nThe general principle of the law of the province of Quebec applicable to civil wrongs of this kind, is that in all cases where real and actual damage is caused to property, or to rights in the nature of property,\u2014jura in re,\u2014an action can be maintained, and if Champlain street had been land belonging to a private owner, not only might such proprietor have maintained an action, but any one having a jus in re in respect of the land, such as a servitude of passage over it, which right of passage had been obstructed by the fallen rock, would have been likewise entitled to legal reparation.\nThen it appearing that the Crown is the owner of the property in which there existed a drain constructed, as far as can be now ascertained, by the Crown itself in the course of the citadel works, and the damage of which the suppliant complains having arisen from the non-repair of this drain, which became choked up and thus caused the accident; and it also appearing that the suppliant has a sufficient locus standi in respect of the streets and water pipes to maintain the petition of right, the authorities quoted show that the city of Quebec is entitled to recover from the Crown the indemnity which it seeks, unless the circumstance that the Crown officers were ignorant of the existence of the drain is an answer, to the claim.\nThat the Crown or its predecessors in title having constructed the drain was bound to repair it there can be no doubt. Laurent says[24]:\nLe d\u00e9faut d\u2019entretien et le vice de construction sont des fautes, etc.\nIt appears to me to be sufficiently proved, at leastf or the purpose of a prim\u00e2 facie case, that the drain was constructed by the Imperial Government in the course of the citadel works many years ago, for the purpose of draining the ditches appertaining to the fortifications; but even granting that it was made before the Crown acquired the property it would make no difference, the Crown would still have been liable to keep it clean and in good repair as the auteurs of the Crown had been originally liable to do.\nThere remains only the question: Does the ignorance of the officers of the Crown of the existence of the drain relieve it from responsibility? If the case depended on proof of negligence or faute that might be a reason why the Crown should be excused from liability. But the legal principles invoked by the appellant, those to which the article 501 gives expression, are such as to impose upon the owner of property a duty incident to that ownership in relation to the proprietors of lands on, an inferior level which no want of knowledge or ignorance upon the part of himself or his servants of existing facts, however obscure or concealed, can properly excuse. The whole doctrine of the law of the province of Quebec, by which this case has to be decided, is in accord with the law of England as laid down by the House of Lords in the case of Rylands v. Fletcher[25]. Then in that case of Rylands v. Fletcher(1) there was ignorance of the true state of the premises, the owners of which were held liable, but that circumstance was not deemed sufficient to exonerate them from liability. And in a late English case, that of Humphries v. Cousins[26], this very point arose and the decision turned entirely upon it. The defendant there, although only a tenant, was held by reason of his occupation to be liable to the owner of the adjoining house for sewage which by means of a drain escaped from the premises of the former into the cellar of the latter, although he (the defendant) had not only not constructed the drain, but was entirely ignorant of its existence, and was expressly found by the jury to be free from negligence. These decisions, being those of English courts on questions of English law, have of course no direct application as binding authorities for the decision of this appeal, which we must determine by the law of Quebec. They are, however, guides which, in the absence of French authority upon the point, we may safely follow. The two systems of law are, as I have said, identical as to the liability here invoked being one arising from the breach of an incidental duty towards inferior proprietors appertaining to the ownership of property and not dependent upon any delict or quasi-delict in the nature of personal negligence. I see therefore no reason why the courts of the province of Quebec in administering their own law should not be content to adopt the principle of these English authorities founded upon reasons which must certainly commend them to every judicial mind. I should have pointed out that no legal servitude could have been acquired by the Crown in respect of the drain in question by prescription, since under the code of Quebec, which in this respect differs from the Code Napol\u00e9on, a servitude cannot be acquired by prescription.\nI now proceed to notice another and distinct point which was forcibly put forward by Mr. Flynn in his very able argument. It was contended by the learned counsel that this is not the case of a party seeking a remedy by petition of right in respect of a cause of action which in English law is denominated a tort, and in French law is classed under the head of delicts or quasi delicts, a cause of action which according to authorities already quoted would not, irrespective of the statutory enlargement of the jurisdiction before; referred to, entitle a subject to maintain a petition of right against the Crown. It was said that the case of the suppliant was not based on faute or negligence, but on a breach of duty imposed by the law, or in the nature of a quasi-contrat, namely, the duty which, as shown by authorities before quoted, is imposed upon the owner of a superior heritage, who executes works on his land or alters its natural state, to indemnify the owner of an inferior property if any damage should be caused by such works. That this is not in the nature of a quasi delict appears from the quotations from Pothier already given. It was insisted that there were no decisions establishing that a petition of right will not lie to compel the performance of an obligation of this kind, and that therefore under the general law as it stood under the petitions of right act, and without having to resort to any statutory extension of that mode of proceeding, just as in the case of a contract the suppliant is entitled to proceed against the Crown in the form of procedure adopted in the present instance. I am of opinion that this argument was well founded and is entitled to prevail.\nNone of the cases in which the remedy by petition of right has been denied to a subject upon the ground that it was sought to make the Crown answer for the wrongful acts of its officers or servants at all resemble this.\nFrom Lord Canterbury\u2019s case down to the present time, nothing more has been decided in cases of this class than that the Crown cannot be made liable for the malfeasance or misfeasance of those in its employ-It never has been decided that a petition of right will not lie to enforce a liability arising, not from any wrongful act, but from an obligation imposed by the law upon a proprietor to indemnify the owner of an inferior property from the consequences of works which, not wrongfully, but in the exercise of a perfect right, the former has constructed on his own property. To say that whilst a petition of right will lie against the Crown for the non-performance of a contract that proceeding is not available for the enforcement of an obligation such as that which is the basis of the suppliant\u2019s claim here, the breach of which does not consist in any act of a wrongful character, but consists in mere nonfeasance, would, it seems to me, be to draw an arbitrary line between cases not to be distinguished in principle.\nWhat we have to look at is not the form of action, but the nature of the substantial obligation for a breach of which a remedy is sought.\nI do not consider it at all conclusive against the suppliant, or a reason entitled to any weight whatever, that under the old English system of actions and pleadings, now abolished, the appropriate remedy for a claim such as the present between subject and subject would have been an action on the case. And this argument, or rather suggestion, arising from the old forms of action formerly prevailing in English law, is the only one which occurs to me as of the slightest relevancy as an answer to the suppliant\u2019s contention, for at the bar no answer calling for any observation was given on behalf of the Crown to the point under consideration.\nFor this last reason, therefore, as well as for that first stated, it appears to me that the suppliant was entitled to relief\nIf I am correct in this conclusion the case need not at all depend on the reasons in favour of the jurisdiction based upon the Exchequer Act and other statutes which I have before stated, and to which I still adhere. The ground last mentioned shows that the suppliant is within the general jurisdiction entertained by the courts in claims against the Crown made with its assent by petition of right. Logically this important proposition should have been advanced first in order, but for convenience and to avoid repetition I have placed it here.\nThe conclusion therefore, is that the appeal must be allowed, the non-Suit set aside, and the case referred back to the Exchequer Court in order that the Crown may proceed with its defence. I think both parties should have liberty to amend their pleadings.\nThe Crown must pay the costs of this appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I adopt the reasons of the learned Chief Justice for allowing this appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I express no opinion as to whether or not the Act 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16 has changed the law as decided in The Queen v. McLeod[27], so as to make the Crown liable in damages for a tort, but assuming that it has the rock upon which the citadel of Quebec rests is not, in my opinion, a public work or a work at all within the meaning of the statute, and the suppliant has failed to prove any negligence on the part of any officer in the service of the Crown from which any injury to property on any public work has resulted. I adopt my brother Grwynne\u2019s reasons on these points.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It cannot be doubted that the Exchequer Court could only acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter of complaint made in the petition of right filed in this case in virtue of some act of the Dominion Parliament giving it jurisdiction in the premises. In 1883 it was decided by this court in The Queen v. McLeod[28], that upon the law relating to the court, as it then stood, a petition of right did not lie against the Crown for injuries resulting from thenon-feasance, misfeasance, wrongs, negligence and omissions of duty of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service upon the Prince Edward Island Railway, a public work placed by statute under the management, direction and control of the Minister of Railways and Canals. It is contended, however, that the law in this respect has been since changed, and no doubt it has been, by the Dominion statute 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, sec. 16, par. (c), which enacts that the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction over\nevery claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment,\nand it is contended that this enactment confers jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court in the circumstances of the present case. If it does not, then that court had no jurisdiction whatever in the premises. The object, intent and effect of the above enactment was, as it appears to me, to confer upon the Exchequer Court, in all cases of claim against the government, either for the death of any person, or for injury to the person or property of any person committed to their charge upon any railway or other public work of the Dominion under the management and control of the government, arising from the negligence of the servants of the government, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon such public work, the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public companies and individuals. It has been suggested that the sentence is open to a wider construction, and it may be that it is so by the insertion of a stop after the word \u201cperson\u201d in paragraph (c). The court would then have jurisdiction in the case of injury to the person wherever arising, if it should arise from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown. With that proposition we are not at present concerned, for the claim here is as to \u201cinjury to property\u201d alone not occurring upon any public work, and we cannot hold that the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in the present case without eliminating wholly from the sentence the words \u201con any public work,\u201d which it is not competent for us to do.\nI am of opinion also that the evidence fails to show that the injury complained of resulted within the meaning of the provision of the statute from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. The suppliant has, in my opinion, failed to bring the case within the provisions of the statute. The Exchequer Court therefore had no jurisdiction in the matter, and the appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nKING J. concurred with Gwynne J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Baillarg\u00e9 & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for respondent: O\u2019Connor, Hogg & Balderson.\n[1] 3 Ex.

The judgment appealed from, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, held that the by-law was intra vires. On motion to quash an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, that the proceedings, being in the interest of the public, are equivalent to the motion or rule to quash of the English practice, and therefore the court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, under subsec.(g), of sec. 24, ch. 135 R.S.C. Sherbrookev. McManamy (18 Can. S.C.R. 594) and Verch\u00e8res v. Varennes (19 Can. S.C.R. 356) distinguished.\nMOTION to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction. The proceedings in this case were commenced in the Superior Court by a petition to annul a municipal by-law taken under section 4389 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nBy the judgment of the first court one section only of the by-law, viz., section 3, which imposes a special tax of $200 a year on hotel-keepers, &c, was declared ultra vires and illegal and was set aside and annulled.\nThe judgment of the Queen's Bench reversed this \"judgment and declared the said section and the tax thereby imposed to be intra vires of the municipal council Brown Q.C. for the motion, cited and relied on The Corporation of the City of Sherboooke v. McManamy ([1]); County of Vercheres v. Varennes ([2]); Bell Telephone Co. v. City of Quebec ([3]); Bourdon v. Benard ([4]); Molson O v. Mayor of Montreal ([5]). Art. 13 C.C.P.\nPanneton Q.C. for appellant cited and relied on art. 4389 R.S.P.Q.; R.S.C. ch. 135, sec. 24 (g).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014-In this case the jurisdiction of the court depends upon sec. 24 subsec. (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, which is as follows:\n24. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court (g) from the judgment in any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule or order of court, or the rule or order to quash it has been refused after argument.\nThis was an application to quash a by-law and not a case like the cases referred to and decided, of Ver-ch\u00e8res v Varennes (2) Sherbrooke v. McManamy (1); and others decided in this court, as in all those cases it was in a private action that the by-laws were impugned, and the proceedings were not to quash or annul the by-laws.\nThis case comes clearly within the statute. The motion to quash must be refused with costs.\nTASCHEREU J.\u2014 I concur fully in the opinion that we have jurisdiction in this case. The different views expressed by this court in the cases relied on by the respondent are not at all in point. It has been expressly said in those cases that where such proceedings are taken in the interest of the public, so that the proceedings would be equivalent to the motion or rule to quash of the English practice, this court would have jurisdiction in cases from the province of Quebec as it has in similar cases from the other provinces, under subsec. (g) of sec. 24 of the Supreme Court Act.

J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C. ch. 135, sees. 24 and 29 \u2014Costs\nHeld,that a judgment in an action by a ratepayer contesting the validity of an homologated valuation roll is not a judgment appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada under section 24 (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and doss not relate to future rights within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nHeld,also that as the valuation roll sought to be set aside in this case-had been duly homologated and not appealed against within the delay provided in art. 1061 (M.C.) the only matter in dispute between the parties was a mere question of costs, and therefore the court would not entertain the appeal. Moir v. Corporation of the Village of Huntingdon (19 Can. S.C.R. 363) followed; Webster v Sherbrooke (24 Can. S. C. R. 52) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant s action.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant, a ratepayer of the municipality of the township of Hinchinbrooke, asking the Superior Court to have the valuation roll of the municipality for the year 1890, which had been homologated and not appealed against, as provided in article 1061 (M.C.), and which was in force for local and county purposes, set aside and declared null and void because the valuators appointed by the lieutenant governor, who were paid a sum of $118 for their services. had been illegally appointed, and that a roll of valuation previously made should have been homologated by the municipal council. The Superior Court maintained the appellant's action and declared the valuation roll null and void. The Court of Queen's Bench, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed the plaintiffs action and held that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the appellant's prayer, the delay for appealing having elapsed since the last roll came into force for logeai and county purposes. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcLaren Q. C. and Laurendeau moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the matter in controversy was for less than $2000 and the case did not come within sees. 24 or 29 of ch. 135 R.S.C., and that it was now a mere matter of costs.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Brossoit Q.C. for appellant contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral). I am of opinion that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. It is not within the provisions of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act sec. 24 (g) R.S.C. ch. 135 which gives jurisdiction in the case of an application to quash a by-law and that for two reasons. The present case is a proceeding not in the nature of a public action, as in the case of Webster v Sherbooke ([1]) decided yesterday by this court, but an action taken in the interest of a private ratepayer; and in the next place, it is not a proceeding to annul the by-law of the corporation. All that is sought is to set up the validity of a valuation roll which the municipal council itself has refused to homologate. Then again it does not refer to future rights. The cases coming under that head in subsec. (b) of sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, are cases which relate to annual rents, or annuities, or periodical payments of an analogous character. In such cases a judgment in an action relating to arrears would be binding in future actions. There is nothing of that kind here.\nI also agree with my learned brothers that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the case of Moir v. Corporation of Huntingdon ([2]). The question in the present action is now merely one of costs. The appeal should be quashed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014(Oral). I agree, but especially upon the ground taken by this court in Fraser v. Tupper ([3]) and Moir v. Corporation of Huntingdon (1). In addition to this case I may also add the following \u2014 Levien v. The Queen ([4]) Gr\u00e9dit Fonder of Mauritius v. Paturau ([5]) Cowen v. Evans ([6]) Attenborough v .Kemp ([7]); Richards v. Birley ([8]).\nThe cases of Inglis v. Mansfield ([9]) and Yeo v. Tatem ([10]) have no application. Here the court might have refused to the appellant his prayer for costs even if it had granted him the setting aside of this valuation roll. Under colour of an appeal on the merits this is virtually but an appeal for costs. The judgment of this court should the appellant succeed, would have no effect but on costs and be executor only as to costs.\nIn a late case, of Martley v. Carson ([11]) the Privy Council, upon this principle, dismissed an appeal without entering upon the merits, upon the ground that it was made to appear before them by affidavit that during the progress of the case in the British Columbia courts the appellant had sold the property in question in the case to his wife. This sale appeared to have been made immediately after the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia but had not been brought to our notice when the case was before this court.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Brossoit & Mercier.\nSolicitors for respondents : seers & Laurendeau.\n[1] 24 Can.

Thus where the plaintiff obtained a judgment in the court of original jurisdiction for less than $2,000 and did not take a cross appeal upon the defendants appealing to the intermediate court of appeal where such judgment was reversed, he was entitled to anneal to this court Levi v Reid (6 Can S.C.R 482) affirmed and followed. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nMOTION to quash appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $285 in an action for $10,000 damages.\nThe action was one for $10,000 damages for alleged violation of contract.\nThe Superior Court gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $285. The defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) and that court allowed the appeal and the plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThere was no cross appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the plaintiff. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, by the plaintiff.\nMacmaster Q.C. moved to quash, the appeal for want of jurisdiction, the amount in dispute being under $2,000. Laflamme contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal is within our jurisdiction. The statute 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 enacts that where the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered if they are different. In the present case the amount recovered in the court of first instance was it is true only $285 but the appellants right to appeal is not dependent in any way upon that. The statute makes the amount demanded which was $10,000, the absolute criterion of the jurisdiction of this court, and without distorting the plain meaning of the language used by Parliament it is impossible to give it any other construction than that I have indicated. The motion to quash must be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU; J. There is undoubtedly room for the objection taken by Mr. Macmaster to our jurisdiction in this case and I am free to say that I was rather inclined at the hearing of the motion to think that we would have to allow it But after consideration I have come to the opposite conclusion. We have, in my opinion, jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. It does certainly look strange that though, generally, we have no jurisdiction in cases under $2,000 where the pecuniary value is to rule, yet we should have to entertain appeals where the amount in controversy before us amounts perhaps only to $10, $15, or $25, simply because, at one time, by the plaintiff's demand the Superior Court had before it an action for an amount exceeding $2,000. Yet that is what Parliament has decreed. The words \"the amount demanded\" in the statute of 1891, mean the amount demanded by the action, as they do in art. 2311 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec. And though the present appellant asked the Court of Appeal to confirm a judgment given in his favour for $285 only, though he cannot here , ask anything more than to restore that judgment of the Superior Court for these $285, ([1]), yet we have jurisdiction according to this last statute of 1891. This statute was passed for the very purpose of giving us jurisdiction in such a case. To admit the respondent's contention would be to declare in effect, that it is now, as it was before this statute, the amount in controversy on the appeal before this court that is to guide in such cases and to hold in fact that this statute has not changed the law, or has changed it only in the case of an appeal by a defendant. This is a limitation in the construction of the statute that is not borne out by its terms. If the words the amount demanded \" mean, in the case of an appeal by the defendant, the amount demanded in the action, as they necessarily must do, I cannot see how in the case of an appeal by the plaintiff they are susceptible of a different construction.\nIf the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench had adversely to the company, defendant, confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, the company would clearly then have had a right to appeal to this court. Yet the amount in controversy before this court in such a case would have been only for $285. This, it seems to me, demonstrates that in such a case it was the intention of Parliament to confer, by way of exception, upon this court, jurisdiction in cases wherein the matter in controversy on the appeal is less than $2,000, whether the appeal is by the plaintiff or by the defendant.\nThe only case present to my mind of an appeal by a plaintiff under circumstances precisely similar to those of the present case is Levi v. Reed ([2]). That case which we had to overrule in accordance with the judgment of the Privy Council in Allan v. Pratt ([3]), is now restored as law by the amending statute in question.\nGWYNNE J \u2014.The question upon this motion is as to the construction and effect of the 4th subsection of sec. 3 of the Dominion statute 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 upon the facts of the present case. That section enacts that \" whenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are diff\u00e8rent'\nSince the decision of this court in Monette v. Lefebvre ([4]) following Allan v. Pratt (2) I feel myself at liberty to express my judgment in the present case unfettered by the decision in Levi v. Reed (1).\nThe effect of the above section of 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 was, in my opinion, to give to a defendant against whom a judgment should be recovered for a less sum than $2,000 in an action in which the plaintiff demands in his statement of claim an amount exceeding $2,000, the same right of appeal as the plaintiff himself would have in such a case, whose right independently of this enactment, was never questioned in such a case, thus placing plaintiff and defendant in the same position in like cases. But where a plaintiff making a demand, in his statement of claim for a sum exceeding $2,000, recovers a judgment against the defendant for a sum less than $2,000 with which judgment he rests content and does not appeal from it but the defendant availing himself of this provision in 54 & 55 Vic. oh. 25, does appeal, and the plaintiff does not then even avail himself of his right to enter a cross appeal the matter submitted to the court by such an appeal would be simply, upon the part of the defendant, a demand to reverse the judgment, and upon the part of the plaintiff a demand to maintain it intact and nothing more. In that case the demand which the plaintiff had made in his statement of claim is gone forever, and is utterly abandoned and is no longer a demand of the plaintiff. When then, as in the present case the defendant was successful in his appeal and obtained judgment in his favour and the plaintiff desires to appeal from that judgment, the sole demand which he makes by such appeal is to have his=judgment, for the amount less than $2,000 which had been so reversed restored. This is the only demand which he could make or the court entertains in such case. They could not entertain a demand for the amount demanded in the statement of claim nor for anything in excess of the amount for which the judgment he asks to be restored was rendered. Between the amount so demanded and the amount recovered by the judgment which is asked to be restored there is no difference and so the case does not come within the purview of the enactment in question. under these circumstances I can see no reason whatever why we should deem ourselves to be under a statutory obligation to hold that to be true which we know to be false, namely, that the amount demanded by the plaintiff is, for the purposes of his proposed Appeal, to be understood to be that which, was demanded in his statement of claim, when in truth and in fact it is for no such amount, but simply for the restoration of the judgment in his favour for less than $2000 and which had been so reversed. For my part I cannot construe the section as imposing upon me any such obligation, and as the plaintiff's demand is for, an amount less than $2,000 I can come to no other conclusion than that there is under the circumstances no appeal to this court, and the appeal therefore should be quashed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred with TASCHEREAU J. that the motion to quash should be refused.\nMotion to quash refused with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant : Greenshields & Greenshields.\nAttorneys for respondents : Mac Master & McLennan.\n[1] Monette v.

Art. 1234 C.C.\nA defendant cannot set up by way of compensation to a claim due to plaintiff a judgment (purchased subsequent to the date of the action) against one who is not a party to the cause, and for whom the plaintiff is alleged to be a pr\u00eate-nom.\nIn an action to recover an amount received by the defendant for the plaintiff the defendant pleaded inter alia that the action was premature inasmuch as he had got the money irregularly from the treasurer of the province of Quebec on a report of distribution of the prothonotary before all the contestations to the report of collocation had been decided\nHeld, affirming the jugement of the court below, that this defence was not open to the defendant as it would be giving him the benefit of his own improper and illegal proceedings.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, which condemned the appellant to pay the respondent Murray the sum of three thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars and ninety-two cents, with interest thereon from the thirtieth day of November eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, less the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars which Murray was condemned to pay Bury for damages. The circumstances which have given rise to the present litigation are briefly as follows:\u2014\nOn the 14th August, 1883, the appellant, declaring himself to be the proprietor of soven undivided thirty-sixths of the island of Anticosti which was to be sold by public limitation, executed before Lecher, notary public, a formal transfer and assignment to. the respondent of two-sevenths of whatever the said seven thirty-sixths might realize after the deduction of law costs and the appellant's personal expenses, and a sum of five hundred and sixty-two dollars for which the respondent was indebted to him, with fifteen per cent interest computed on said deductions from the dates when the sums were originally advanced. The appellant acknowledged in the notarial assignment that the said transfer was made to respondent for good and valuable consideration previously received by him,\" appellant.\nThe limitation sale took place on the 17th of June, 1884, and realized $1010000 and the appellant was collocated as proprietor of the seven thirty-sixths of the said island and withdrew the amount of the said collocation but refused to pay over to respondent the two sevenths of said price as provided by said agreement and transfer.\nAppellant was collocated for $2,866 as representing one thirty-sixth share, and $16,578 as representing six thirty-sixths, these shares having been acquired through different channels. Appellant's collocation to the six thirty-sixths was contested by one Mrs. Torre who had a claim against the property, but by the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada the appellant's rights to the amounts collocated to him for such six thirty-sixths were maintained, and he was thereby enabled to, and did secure payment to himself of said amount. The sum claimed by respondent in this action was two-sevenths of seven thirty-sixths of such price of sale after allowing certain deductions provided for in the deed of agreement between the parties.\nThe terms of this agreement were somewhat modified by a letter written by the appellant to respondent on the twelfth day of June, 1885, in which he says:\u2014\nMONTREAL, 12th June, 1885.\n\"GEORGE MURRAY, ESQ.,\nDEAR SIR,\u2014As soon as the present contestation shall have closed and I declared to be the owner of two-twelfths of the Island of Anticosti, I shall give you an order on Mr. Duberger, prothonotary of Murray Bay, for the portion of money coming to you according to the terms of a certain deed made by Leclerc, notary public, as between yourself and the undersigned,\nYours truly,\nGEORGE BURY.\nP.S \u2014 it is also agreed that the whole amount for expenses will only he reckoned as five hundred dollars although the sum expended was considerably in advance of that sum. The amount due for interest referred to in the deed of agreement shall be fixed at a sum of not more than two hundred dollars.\nGEORGE BURY.\"\nThe appellant neglecting to comply with the agreement the respondent's attorneys made a formal demand upon him for such order and then instituted legal proceedings against him.\nThe plaintiff was examined in order to establish a commencement de prevue that he was merely a prete-nom for one W. L. Forsyth and other witnesses were also heard subject to objection to prove that the written transfer was not an absolute transfer but only consented to as a method of security for some indebtedness due to respondent by said W. L. Forsyth. At the trial it was established that the judgment which one Cadieux a creditor of Forsyth's had against Forsyth was acquired by appellant two months after the date of respondent's action.\nBarnard Q.C. and Lafleur, for appellant. The present appeal rests on two grounds, as practically the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench did also. The first is that Mr. Forsyth was the real plaintiff in the case and that his claim was extinguished by compensation. The second that the action should at all events have been dismissed on the general issue, for want of proof.\nIt is submitted on the evidence that it is clear that the question in both its parts must be answered in the affirmative. If the courts below have reached a different conclusion it is owing to very serious and main fest misapprehensions both as to the law and the facts of the matter.\nIn the Queen's Bench the question was treated as if the sole issue were whether the respondent was a pr\u00eate-nom at the time of the transfer, while it is sufficient for us to show he was at the time of the action, when the debt due by Forsyth had been paid.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, contending that nothing was due to respondent and that he was a mere pr\u00eate-nom, and cited Bedarride on Dol. & Fraude ([1]) Laurent ([2]).l\nThen as to the plea of compensation we contend we had a right to acquire the judgments even pendente lite. Art. 1187 C. C; Frostc v. Esson ([3]); Williams v. Rousseau ([4]); Roy v. McShane ([5]); Thibodeau v. Girouard ([6]). Finally we submit that under the agreement the respondent could not claim his share until the whole contestation of the dividend sheet was closed and settled effectually.\nThe contestation of the dividend sheet is not closed and settled as alleged, and the appellant has not received the whole $17,880.22 1\/3-, as also alleged, but $14,159.58 1\/3 only, if even he can be said to have received that amount regularly.\nMartin for respondent. Appellant admitted in his examination that by a final judgment of the Supreme Court rendered in June, 1888, his right to the amount collocated to him in the disputed item in the report of the distribution had been established, and by means of said judgment he had been enabled to secure and had secured the payment to himself of said amount.\nNo proof was adduced to destroy the effect of appellant's better of the twelfth of June. 1885.\nAnd clearly it does not lie in the mouth of appellant to attack a deed granted by himself for a consideration known to himself and judged sufficient, by suggesting frauds between himself, appellant and Forsyth, and of which he has not adduced one word of proof and oral evidence cannot be given to vary an absolute deed of transfer. Art. 1234. C.C.\nIf plaintiff was not a pr\u00eate-nom for Mr. W. L. Forsyth then the plea of compensation cannot be relied on, and, moreover, there is another reason which disposes of this plea; it is, as the courts below have held, that it rests on a judgment acquired since the action was taken.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE The appellant alleges that the notarial deed of the 14th August, 1883, whereby he transferred to the respondent two-sevenths of the price of the Island of Anticosti was not what on its face it purports to be, namely, an absolute transfer. It is, asserted by the appellant that the respondent was originally a mere pr\u00eate-nom for one William Langan For- sixth or that the deed in question, if not made altogether for the behoof of Forsyth, was passed for the purpose, in the first place, of securing the payment to the respondent of certain moneys in which Forsyth then stood indebted to him and then to be for the benefit of Forsyth, and that these moneys having been long since paid the respondent now holds the share in the sale moneys transferred by the deed for the benefit of Forsyth absolutely; and further, that in either of the alternatives mentioned the appellant is entitled to compensate the respondent's demand, which it is alleged is really the demand of Forsyth, by a certain judgment recovered by one Cadieux against Forsyth, and by Cadieux transferred to the appellant.\nI am of opinion that the appellant has entirely failed in proof of his allegations. It has been determined, first by Mr. Justice Davidson and then by the Court of Appeals that there was no sufficient commencement of proof in writing to be found in the deposition of the respondent to let in the testimony of witnesses. Whether this is so or not can in the view which I take, make no difference, for even assuming that there was a perfectly good commencement of proof in writing verbal evidence would still be inadmissible. Article 1234 of the Civil Code says.\nTestimony cannot in any case be received to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument.\nThe deed of transfer of the 14th August 1883, being in terms an absolute transfer to the respondent, the attempt' to alter it by the evidence of witnesses so as to make it conformable to the appellant's contention, namely that it was a transfer to the respondent as a pr\u00eate-nom for Forsyth, or as a mere security to the respondent for a debt since paid, and now held for the benefit of Forsyth, is of course an attempt to con triadic or vary its terms by testimony in contravention of article 1234. Then is it permissible, notwithstanding this article 1234, to receive verbal testimony to alter or contradict a deed or other writing on the ground that there is a commencement of proof in writing? By article 1233 seven cases are enumerated in which testimonial proof is admissible; one of them is the case where there is a commencement of proof by writing. Then as article 1234 says that oral proof shall not in any case be received it must be interpreted as excluding all the cases mentioned in the next preceding article. It is not to the purpose to show that the French authorities are against this for the French code makes different provisions for such a case. Art. 1341 of that code which says that oral proof shall not be received against actes is followed by article 1347, which introduces an express exception in favour of the admission of such proof when there exists a commencement of proof by writing. This question is ably treated in a work on the law of evidence in the province of Quebec ([7]) lately published; and in the absence of judicial decisions to the contrary I adopt the learned author's conclusions, inasmuch as they appear to be founded on unanswerable arguments.\nHad there been a full admission by the, respondent that there was such a collateral agreement as the appellant alleges such admission would, no doubt, be sufficient to support his case but I am unable to find such an admission though I have read the respondent's deposition several times. This evidence is not clear; in some respects it is quite incoherent but the effect of what the respondent says, so far as I can gather it, is that the deed was intended to be what in its terms it purports to be, and that he (the respondent) considered himself under some honorary, but not under any legal, obligation to give something to Forsyth out of any surplus. This is, of course, insufficient. The deed according to the respondent's account, and according to the evidence of Forsyth, appears to have been made at the instance of Forsyth and under pressure by the appellant for the payment of the $562 note, and Forsyth swears very positively that the respondent was not in any way a pr\u00eate-nom for him (Forsyth) and that he was not to have any legal benefit from the transfer. I think, therefore, the case entirely fails upon the evidence. Further I am at a loss to see how, even if that which the appellant desired to prove was established, it would be possible to have the benefit of a compensation of the judgment transferred by Cadieux when Forsyth is not a party in cause. Then, as to the other objection that the action is premature for the reason that the contestation of the collocation had not been decided, as it appears by the prothonotary's certificate dated 6th November 1889, that it had not been, I think that defence also fails. The appellant, by means of certain representations made by him to the treasurer of the province of Quebec, obtained the amount which he was set down as entitled to receive in the prothonotary's report of collocation; this fact is admitted by the appellant in his deposition when called as a witness by the respondent. In the face of this admission that he has actually got the money into his own hands it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to say he got it irregularly, that by untrue representations he procured it to be paid to him when he was not entitled to receive it. I think the rule that no one can take advantage of his own wrong applies, and if we were to admit the sufficiency of this reason of appeal we should be doing nothing less than giving the appellant the benefit of his own improper and illegal proceeding by means of which he induced the provincial treasurer to pay this money to him when, as he well knew, he had no right to receive it.\nI do not make the figures given in the judgment of the Superior Court tally with the amount admitted to have been received by the appellant, hut I do not remember that any point was made of this at the hearing of the appeal, nor do I find it referred to in the appellant's factum. If it appears in drawing up the judgment that there has been any mistake in this respect it may be rectified, but that will not of course affect the costs for the appeal must in any event be dismissed with costs subject to the alteration mentioned if any should be required to be made.\nFOURNIER J. I concur.\nTASCHEREAU J. For the reasons given by the Superior Court, in its formal judgment, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI express no opinion, one way or the other, on the point determined by the majority of the court as to the admissibility of verbal evidence under arts. 1233, 1234 1235 of the code where there is a commencement de preuve par \u00c9crit.

G. R. a merchant then and at the time of his death domiciled in the city of Quebec, while temporarily in the city of New York made the following will in accordance with the law relation- to holograph wills in Lower Canada:\n\"I hereby will and bequeath all my property, assess or means of any kind to my brother Frank, who will use one-half of them for Public Protestant Charities in Quebec and Carluke, say the Protestant Hospital Home, French Canadian Mission, and amongst poor relatives as he may judge best, the other half to himself and for his own use, excepting, \u00a32,000, which he will send to Miss Mary Frame, Ovary on Farm\u201d\nA.R. and others heirs at law of the testator, brought action to have the will declared invalid.\nHeld, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the will was valid.\nHeld further, Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting, that the rule locus regit actum was not in the Province of Quebec before the code, nor since under the code itself (art. 7), imperative, but permissive only. Held also Taschereau J. dissenting, that the will was valid even if the rule locus regit actum did apply because it sufficiently appeared from the evidence that by the law of the State of New York the will would be considered good as to movables wherever situated, having been executed according to the law of the testator's domicile and good as to immovable\u2019s in the Province of Quebec, having been executed according to the law of the situation of those immovables.\nIn this action interventions were filed by Morin College, an institution where youth are instructed in the higher branches of learning, and especially young men intended for the ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, who are entitled to receive a free general and theological education, and are assisted by scholarships and bursaries to complete their education; by the Finlay Asylum, a corporate institution for the relief of the aged and infirm, belonging to the communion of the Church of England; and by W. R. R., a first cousin of the testator claiming as a poor relative.\nHeld, that Morin College did not come within the description of a charitable institution according to the ordinary meaning of the words and had therefore no locus stcbti to intervene; Sedgwick J. dissenting; but that Finlay Asylum came within the terms of the will as one of the charities which F. R. might select as a beneficiary, and this gave it a right to intervene to support the will.\nHeld further, that in the gift to poor relatives\" the word \"poor\" was too vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it and must therefore be rejected and the word \"relatives\" should be construed as excluding all except those whom the law, in the case of an intestacy, recognized as the proper class among whom to divide the property of a deceased person, and W. R. R. not coming within that class his intervention should be dismissed.\nHeld, per Fournicr and Taschereau JJ., that the bequests to \"poor relatives\u201d was absolutely null for uncertainty.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the action to set aside the will of the Hon James Gibb Ross was dismissed as to part of the claim and affirmed as to the remainder. The will, which appears at length in the head note, was wholly written and signed by the testator while temporarily in New York in 1865, and was by him mailed from New York to Quebec addressed to his brother Frank; it was subsequently restored to the testator, who on various occasions subsequently at Quebec delivered it to Mr. F. Ross the last occasion being in 1883, five years before his death.\nThe estate in the province of Quebec alone is sworn at about four millions. The testator further had large property, both real and personal in other provinces of Canada and in the United States.\nDuring the pendency of the suit William Russell Ross a first cousin and former partner of the testator, then in bad health and advanced in life, in poor circumstances and with a large family, applied for assistance, pleading the terms of the will, and upon being refused he presented a petition in intervention which was allowed cause to the contrary being shown by plaintiffs and defendants.\nSubsequently further interventions were filed by Morrin College and Finlay Asylum, claiming to be public protestant charities and as such to be interested in supporting the validity of the will.\nPlaintiffs and defendants also opposed these interventions, but the points taken were decided against them by the Superior Court.\nThe plaintiffs contended that the will was invalid because being in holograph form, it was made in New York where wills made in that form are not in general recognized; and, further, that the trust devise is void for uncertainty and that thus the trust half should be apportioned amongst the heirs-at-law. Mr. Frank Ross answered that the will was in all respects valid that under it he took the estate u subject to the trusts therein stated,\" and that, by the law of New York, wills made by persons domiciled elsewhere are valid in that State so far as personality therein is concerned, if made in the form required by the law of the testator's domicile. To the interventions, the plaintiffs and the defendant Frank Ross pleaded similar defences\u2014the defendant in addition demurring.\nFor pleas to the interventions plaintiffs set up:\n1. The will was bad in form as having been made in New York.\n2. Under no circumstances is Morrin College\u2014an institution under Presbyterian control entitled to anything.\n3. Under no circumstances is the Finlay Asylum\u2014 an institution under the control of the Church of England\u2014entitled to anything.\n4. Under no circumstances is William Russell Ross entitled to anything because Mr. Frank Ross \u201chas declared that in his judgment the said intervening is not entitled to any part of the money so bequeathed as aforesaid.\"\n5. The firm composed of W. R. Ross and testator lost money, which fact disqualifies W. R. Ross from receiving anything under the will.\n6. The whole of the estate of the testator has been vested in Frank Ross by the will, and no separate trust has been created by the will, and neither the intervenient nor any other person have a right to interfere with Frank Ross in the matter of any bequest whatever, the whole will (except the bequest to Mary Frame) being entirely and absolutely at his discretion, supposing that the will is valid as the intervenient pretend.\nThe defendant Frank Ross contested the interventions on the grounds following:\n1. That the whole estate and succession was also lutely his own, and the bequests in favour of public protestant charities and of poor relations were void for vagueness and uncertainty, and conferred no right whatever in favour of any charity or relation.\n2. As Episcopalian and Presbyterian institutions, the Finlay Asylum and Morrin College have no claim under the will.\n3 At the time of the death of the testator W. B. Ross was indebted to his estate in the sum of $ 116,279.30 for his share of a losing speculation in 1872 and for a subsequent advance of $40,000 made in 1885, and is consequently disqualified from taking under the will.\n4. For the reasons stated, and denying that he is called upon to exercise any discretion; Frank Ross declared that under no circumstances will he ever give anything to his cousin, W. R. Ross.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Stuart Q C. for the appellant Frank Ross.\nThe present appeal is from part of the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, whereby the legality of the bequest in the will directing the appellant to use one-half of his estate for public protestant charities in Quebec and Carluke and amongst poor relatives as he should judge best, Was sustained.\nThe evidence establishes that a holograph will is invalid according to the laws of New York unless executed by the testator in presence of two witnesses and attested by them that nevertheless, a holograph will, executed in New York by a person domiciled in Quebec would be valid in New York to pass personal property but not real estate, provided the will were valid in Quebec. Sec. 2611 N.Y. Code of Procedure.\nA testamentary bequest, to be valid, must be the expression of the will of the testator; he cannot make a legacy depend upon the will of a third person, nor can he leave the choice of the legatee to a third person? Pothier ([2]); C.C. art. 756; 7 Aubry & Ran ([3]); Toullier ([4]); 3 Zachariae (Mass\u00e9 & Verg\u00e9) ([5]); 18 Demolombe ([6]); Re Jean Merendol ([7]); Merlin ([8]); de Sauvan v. de Sarrieu ([9]); Moeglin v. Willig ([10]); D\u00e9t\u00e8ve & D\u00e9t\u00e8ve ([11]); Laboujouderie v. Raffier ([12]); Legrand -Masse v. H\u00e9vitiers L\u00e9pine ([13]); Beurier v. Emorine ([14]); Britelle v. D\u00e9yvrande ([15]); Simon v. Simon ([16]).\nSaying that if no discretionary power had been given the law would imply equal distribution and the court would distribute equally would be to assume the validity of a bequest to charities unnamed and undefined and to relatives undescribed In Liddard v. Liddard ([17]) the question arose as to the distribution of property among the children of the deceased. In such a case our law provides for equal distribution but as between relatives some distant and some close, the law gives to the nearer collateral relations to the entire exclusion of the further.\nThe Superior Court has not the powers of the courts in France nor of the Parlement de Paris and cannot overrule the express provisions of the statute 34 George 3, ch. 6, which while conferring upon the Courts of King's Bench, to which the Superior Court succeeded, the jurisdiction of the Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de Paris, provided that nothing in the act should grant the court legislative powers possessed by any court prior to the conquest. Stuart v. Bowman ([18]); McGibbon v. Abbott ([19]); Titden v. Green ([20]); Levy v. Levy ([21]).\nWhat shall be considered charities in England is settled by the statute 43 Elizabeth c. 4.\nThe doctrine of the English law, which it is suggested the court should follow in this case for the purpose of preventing the legacy from lapsing in the event of the appellant not executing it, has been harshly criticized and does not recommend itself either by its wisdom or its justice. Gary v. Abbot ([22]). See remarks by Sir William Grant in Morice v. The Bishop of Durham ([23]).\nThe decisions in Contant v. Mercier ([24]) have no material bearing upon this discussion, as the question of jurisdiction and power was never raised.\nThe intervening parties should be not only possible but certain beneficiaries, to justify their intervention. The old rule \" l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est Ia mesure des actions, \" as contained in the Code of Procedure art 13 applies The decision in the Privy Council in McGibbon v Abbott ([25]), appears to support the view that where a person's rights are dependent upon the exercise of a legal discretion vested in another no right to defend the instrument creating the discretion accrues until after the exercise of the discretion has created a right Isaac v. Defriez ([26]); Attorney-General v. Price ([27]); Anon. ([28]).\nAs to the Morrin College it is an educational institution and in no sense a charity.\nThe Finlay Asylum, though a charitable institution in the proper acceptation of the word, is not a public charity. By its Act of Incorporation, 20 Vic. ch. 219, the Finlay Asylum is founded for the relief of persons of the communion of the Church of England and the government of the institution is vested in the rector and church wardens of the parish church of Quebec.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Lafleur for appellants, Annie Ross and John Theodore Ross. The will in question was made before the coming in force of the Civil Code and its formal validity must be decided by the law at the time of its execution. Dalloz ([29]).\nNone of the articles of the Code which refer to this subject purport to introduce new law. They express the law as it stood immediately before the passing of the Code and for a long time anterior thereto.\nArticle 7 of our Civil Code adopts in its entirety the rule locus regit actum. This rule was always considered as imperative, and not merely facultative. Re Gilbert Andras ([30]); de Pommereu ([31]); Merlin ([32]); in re de Bosel ([33]); in re d'Argelos ([34]).\nAll decided in the Picqassary case ([35]), was that holograph wills were authorized by the custom of Angouleme. See also, Bourjon ([36]); Ricard ([37]).\nArticle 999 C. N. really emphasizes the rule by creating a special exception in favour of holograph wills made abroad by Frenchmen. Demolombe ([38]); Marcad\u00e9 sur art. 999. Laurent ([39]); Browning v. de Nayve ([40]); Mend\u00e9s v. Brandon ([41]); Aubry & Rau ([42]). In England and Scotland, up to 24 & 25 Vic. ch. 114, the rule was that validity of the will depended on the law of the testator's last domicile By this act British subjects, only in so far as regards personal estate, may adopt the forms recognized by the lex actus, or by the law of the domicile of origin. Dicey On Domicile ([43]).\nIn the United States the rule recognized is that of the testator's domicile. Story Confl of Laws ([44])\nThe rule of the law of New York requires conformity to the law of Quebec; and as the law of Quebec requires that the formalities of foreign law should be adopted and followed the provisions of our law have not been complied with, and the will is invalid.\nThe Marquis de Bonneval died in 1836, in London where he had resided for a considerable period and left a will executed in England in the English form dated 19th September, 1814. The will was contested and the question debated whether the Marquis de Bonneval was domiciled in England or in France. The court held that the testator had never lost his French domicile of origin, notwithstanding his prolonged residence in England, that the validity of the will should be decided by the French law and ordered a suspension of proceedings until a decision should be obtained from the French courts. De Bonneval v. De Bonneval ([45]).\nBoth the Court of Appeal and the Cour de Cassation held that as the testator had followed the usual form required by the place of execution (England), the will must be held valid.\nIf the will in question is considered as a will in the English form it could not operate in regard to realty even in Quebec inasmuch as it does not comply with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Meiklejohn V. Atty. Gen ([46]).\nSec. 10 of the Quebec Act merely introduced a new form of will, and must be interpreted as referring to wills made within the province. Endlich on Statutes, ss. 174, 387; Migneautt v. Malo ([47]).\nThe French rule locus regit actum is part of our law, is an imperative rule, and was constantly and inflexibly applied by the highest courts in old France, and is still applied by the Cour de Cassation in France, and cannot be characterized as unreasonable or inconvenient as compared with the English rule in force when the Quebec Act was passed, and down to the Imperial Act 24 & 25 Vic. c. 114.\nThe power of election given Frank Ross by the will is so absolute that he might, following McGibbon v. Abbott ([48]). entirely exclude any one of the intervenants.\nThe rule known as the cy pr\u00e9s doctrine, when the beneficiary cannot be ascertained, has no place in our law nor do the modern French decisions apply ([49]). To follow the case of Liddard v. Liddard ([50]) would be to violate the testator\u2019s express intention.. The legacy to charities and poor relations should be declared to be void for vagueness and uncertainty, and because, in the absence of the exercise by Frank Ross of the discretionary powers vested in him by the will, the courts of this province could not enforce the execution of this bequest.\nThe present appellants do not agree with Frank Ross as to the disposition which should be made of the fund representing this trust in the event of the bequest being set aside. If the charitable bequest is void heirs-at-law are entitled to half the estate Presumptive heirs of a man still living would not be permitted to take any proceedings, even conservatory, with respect to an estate in which they may never have any real interest, and it is difficult to see why the present ineervenants should be in any better position than presumptive heirs.\nWith regard to William Russell Ross, such discretion as the trustee may have has been exercised so as exclude him from all participation in the estate.\nAs to Morrin College, under its charter, 24 Vic. ch.. 109, which provides in section 7 that all the property belonging to the corporation shall be exclusively applied to the advancement of education in the college, and to no object, institution or establishment whatever not in connection with nor independent of the same, it cannot be regarded as constituting a charitable institution.\nAs regards the Finlay Asylum, incorporated by 20 Vic. c. 219 such a sectarian institution cannot pretend to be a public charitable institution of Quebec, and has no locus standi in this case, and no right or interest to support the will in question.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Stuart Q.C. for respondent Frank Ross on the appeal of Annie Ross et al, prayed the confirmation of that part of the judgment appealed from, whereby the sufficiency of the will is established, citing:\u2014C. C. art. 7; Pothier Don. ch. 1, art. 1, s. 1; Arret of 14th July 1722 (Jour. des Audiences, lib. 5, ch. 31. Ricard ([51]); Bornier ([52]); Boullenois ([53]); Savigny, Private International Law p. 265. F\u00e6lix Droit International Priv\u00e9 ([54]); 5 Pardessus ([55]); 1 Laurent ([56]); Dalloz ([57]); 1 Aubry & Rau ([58]). Geoffrion Q.O. and Lafleur for respondents Annie Ross and John T. Ross on the appeal of Frank Ross. The reasons and authorities on behaff of these respondents have been set forth at length on their own appeal.\nIrvine Q.C. and Cook Q.C. for respondents \"The Morrin College \" and \"The Finlay Asylum.\" (Fitzpatrick Q.C. with them).\nThe question for solution is: Is a holograph will made in New York by a person temporarily there, but domiciled at the time in the province of Quebec, and owning both moveable and immoveable property in said province, which is disposed of by the will valid such form of will not being locally recognized by the laws of New York, although the rule prevails there as elsewhere generally in the United States, that a will disposing of moveable property is valid if made in the form prescribed by the laws of the testator's domicile\u2014one disposing of immoveable being only valid if made in accordance with the law of the place where the real property is situated lex rei sitae?\nAgainst the validity of the will it is urged that the matter must be governed by our own law, and that by it the maxim, locus regit actum, requires a will made in New York to be made in a form valid by the laws of that state on pain of nullity. It is contended that article 7 of our Code, based on the ancient law follows this rule and declares, at least by implication that acts and deeds are invalid if not made in the form required by the lex loci actus; that our Code must be interpreted on this point in conformity with the old French law which prevailed in this province, and that by that law such a will was invalid.\nSuch a conclusion seems to be contrary to the whole avowed policy of our Code and of the Imperial statute 14 George 3, ch. 83, on the subject of wills, by which freedom of willing and facilities for doing so were extremely favoured and carried far beyond anything known to the old law the policy of which in this respect was the very reverse of our own, seeking as it did uniformly to restrict the powers of and facilities for disposal by testament.\nSee Merlin's opinion re de Mercy ([59]). He is far from Placing the maxim locus regit actum on a firm foundation as a rule of settled law. He cites the law and a large number of writers, including Vinnius, Burgundies, Rodenburg, against the rule. Again in the same article ([60]), Merlin reports an appeal judgment in the case of the will of Despuget, of the 20th August, 1806 which clearly shows how far the doctrine was from settled law. Troplong ([61]), speaking of article 999 of the Code Napoleon does not say that tt is an innovation or new law but asserts that it gives the preference to the opinion of Ricard and his school, the opposite opinion, that is, from that of Furgole, Guyot and Merlin, which opinion was supported not only by Ricard, but by Boullenois, Cujas and many of the greatest names in French jurisprudence as well as by arr\u00e9ts of parliament Troplong refers to an arr\u00e9t to that effect as not an isolated one * and how divided views were on the question is seen in the statement of the various opinions by Pothier, and by all the authors who discuss it (Laurent Droit Tnt., vol. 6, nos. 406, 422, 424), or by referring to even the last arr\u00e9t reported by Merlin, or to any arr\u00e9t that deals with the subject, an example of which is seen in the arr\u00eat of Cambolas, liv. 4 ch. 41 where the question is discussed both as regards wills and contracts in an arr\u00eat of the 7th of August, 1622, there reported. The old wrtters and Ricard, cited under G. 0. art. 854 are in favour of the validity of such wills made abroad, in conformity with the law of the testator\u2019s domicile. In this they are supported by Boullenois and by Cujas. At no. 191 of part I of Ricard, he cites an arr\u00e9t in support of the validity of a holograph will by letter missive, and gives as a precedent the case of the codicil made by Lentulus in a letter wrttten from Africa, which was approved by Augustus, and became law as stated in the Institutes B. 2 tit. 25.\nWharton, Conflict of Laws, 2nd ed. p. 573 and sec. 588; Story, Conflict of Laws, ss. 465, 468, et seq.; 4 Burge, Colonial and Foreign Laws, p. 582 et seq., and p. 590; Savigny sec. 381 p. 824. The observance of the form in use at the place of the act is merely facieItative and allows an election. Flix p. 107. Bar 36. Westlake, Private International Law 123. F\u0153elix vol. 1 p. 181.

Int, 653; Aubry & Rau, vol. 7, subsec. 699; 21 Demolombe 142.\nThe Imperoal statute 14 Geo. 3, introducing the absolute freedom of devise by will and the right of willing in the English form \" with all its incidents \" laid down by the Privy Council in Migneaut v. Malo ([63]), necessarily introduced the right of making a will in the form of the lex domicilii, Until the Code the power to make wills in this form existed and British subjects could make them anywhere. Meiklejohn v. The Attorney General ([64]). Personalty follows the law of the domicile, wills are valid if made in accordance with the law of the domicile, and only valid (till 24 & 25 Vic), if made according to such law. This principle is a rule of private international law and part of the jus gentium. Groker v. The Marquis of Herford ([65]); Bremer v. Freeman ([66]); Whicker v. Hume ([67]); Story Conflict of Laws ([68]); Wheaton ([69]).\nUnder the old law of France previous to the cession the weight of authority was in favour of the rule locus regit actum being facultative and not imperative, in relation to wills; and during the last 150 years the rule that a testator may make his will in relation to personalty, according to the lex domiclili,, has by common assent become a rule of private international law.\nThe will is valid under 14 Geo. 3, ch. 83, in force when it was made, and preserved quoad it, by 0. 0. art. 2613.\nThe lex loci actus was not violated but observed the law of New York empowering strangers to make wills according to the lex domicilii The devise in trust and the discretion of the trustee come expressly under art 869 of the Civil Code which the codifiers (fourth report art. 124 bis, p. 181) state to be purely old law. The nature and extent of this discretion is well stated by Troplong, Pothier and all the authors ([70]). Quoniam quasi viro bono ei potius commissum est, non in meram volunatem h\u00e6redis collatum. The discretion in this case is much less than in those cited.\nThe expression, as he may judge best, would not admit of discussion in view of the opinion expressed by all the authors\u2014that si putaveris is binding. Frank Ross is bound to distribute the trust estate whether he will or not, to the best of the judgment of a bonus vii due regard being had, as Troplong says, to the fortune to be distributed, the position and needs of the recipients and all other circumstances.\nTo judge of the distribution evidence can be given even parol before the court of all matters that will enable it to judge of the bona fides of the distribution, and, how far it conforms to the judgment or arbitrium boni viri ([71]); Dellevaux v. Jambon ([72]).\nThe trustee cannot defeat the trust by refusing to distibute the fund The court will do it for him even un ter English law where the courts allow much more absolute discretion to trustees than does our own which in this respect is based on the equitable doctrine of the Roman law approved and adopted by Pothier and our best jurists. But even by English law the trustee must distribute the funds. Thus Lewin on Trusts ch. 28, p. 836, is in point. Gower v. Mainwaring ([73]).\nThe fact of a trustee having refused or failed to make a distribution is a ground on which the court will interfere and control him. Lewin, 777. The discretion is not as to who are to be the objects of the charity or bequest, but as to the proportion to each, and that must be bon\u00e1 fide and not capriciously determined. Lewin, 839.\nAbbott v. McGibbon ([74]) does not apply, as the object arrived at in substitutions is to conserve the property in the family, and that object is secured by giving to one of the family. In the Ross will the object is to support charities generally of a particular class and poor relations and to give all to one or to a few is to defeat the intention of the testator. For arr\u00eats see Ricard, no. 589, and Beaucourt v. Soc. &c. de Lille ([75]).\nThere is no vagueness and uncertainty in the sum, for the amount is fixed nor in the objects, for they are readily ascertainable. No microscopic search is required to discover the public Protestant corporate charities of this city and of a small Scotch village. See also Nocid v. Noad ([76]); Molsor's Bank v. Lioncais ([77]); Comte v. Lagac\u00e9 ([78]); Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois ([79]); Harding v. Glyri ([80]); Taylor, Ev. ([81]); Moggridge v. Thackwell ([82]); Power v. Cassidy ([83]).\nIt is sufficient for tlie intervenants to establish a prima facie interest; the question of their absolute rights is to be decided, when other claimants have been notified to appear. The immediate object is to defend the document on which their rights depend, which is impugned by both the plaintiffs and the defendant.\nThe charter of the Finlay Asylum (20 Vic, ch. 219) establishes that it is a public Protestant charity at Quebec.\nThe case of Morrin College is still stronger. The testator was for years a governor; he repeatedly expressed his intention of providing for it substantially; a short while before his death he stated that the college had been opened prematurely and on insufficient means that it was doing a good work and would succeed, and he was in the habit of contributing to its bursary fund for the assistance of students with limited means.\nWhat Morrin College is, and was intended to be, its charter (24 Vic. ch. 109) the trust deed and deed of gift produced in the case the statement of the first principal, and the evidence abundantly show. The deeds explain Dr. Morrin's intentions:\u2014\n\" Whereas, the said Joseph Morrin is desirous of leaving some permanent memorial of his regard for the city of Quebec, * * * and at the same time of marking his attachment to the Church in which he was reared, and to which he has always belonged;\n\" And whereas he considers none can be more suitable for both purposes than a provision for increasing and rendering more perfect the means of obtaining for the youth generally, and especially those who may devote themselves to the ministry of the said Church the means of obtaining a liberal and enlightened education; he does, &c, &c.\"\nThe inaugural address declares the principles which were intended to guide the policy of the college, and which have ever since been pursued. For over thirty years, with very limited resources, it has, apart from theological instruction which was necessarily Presbyterian, afforded a liberal and enlightened education to all desirous of obtaining it, without test or subscription of any kind, and by means of professors belonging, not only to the various Protestant churches but to the Roman Catholic church. Nominal fees exacted from others have never been required from poor students, who have also, apart from their religious belief, been aided by money bursaries and free accommodation in the college rooms. The generous intention of the founder was to supply a want which, the University being exclusively Catholic, and its instructions given almost entirely in the French language, could not so well render to the Protestant and English speaking youth.\nBoth French and English law regard colleges as charities. If the statute of Elizabeth on charitable trusts is in force in this province the question does not admit of a doubt; and in a sense it is submitted that that statute is in force From the earliest period the King, as paler patrice, was by his prerogative the guardian and protector of charities. The act of Elizabeth declared and defined the charitable objects over which the prerogative extended and in this sense it forms part of our law, as necessarily being introduced at the cession of the country to the British Crown CO., 869. Theobald, pp. 181, 182. Pomeroy v. Willway ([84])\nThe King's Edict of 1743, cited in Fraser v. Abbott ([85]), prohibited under certain circumstances the foundation of charitable establisments by will\nOur own statute book, in which for the last hundred years educational and benevolent institutions are classed together, fully bears out this view. Desrivi\u00e9res v. Richardson ([86]).\nNo order was made in the Superior Court as to costs As to whether the estate generally, as held by Chief Justice Meredith, in Russell v. Lefrancois ([87]), and supported by this court ([88]), the losing parties individually, should bear the costs, it is for the court to say. It is clearly a hardship for the successful parties to be compelled to bear their own. It may he said that no appeal has been taken by the intervenants in this case. That is true; but all costs are in the legal discretion of the court seized of the cause; and in Peters v. The Quebec Harbour Commisioners ([89]), where no appeal was taken on this subject, the court dealt in its own way with costs. The respondents submit that costs should be awarded in all courts.\nThe respondents ask that the judgment appealed against be affirmed, and costs awarded them in all courts;\n1. Because the will is in all respects valid, both as a holograph will under the French system, and as a will of personalty under the English system in force in this province in 1865;\n2. Because under the will, a valid trust was established, to the extent of one-half of the estate passing under it in favour of charities and Door relations and by proving the will and accepting and administering the estate Mr. Frank Ross accepted the office and assumed the duties and responsibilities of a trustee;\n3. Because Morrin College and the Finlay Asylum are public Protestant charities within the meaning of the will; and William Russell Ross is a poor relative within such meaning, and as such they had an interest to intervene for the purpose of defending and establishing the validity of the document upon which their rights and those of their cobeneficiaries depend;\n4. Because Frank Ross having asserted that the whole estate devised was his own absolutely and having disregarded the obligations of a trustee, the respondents were bound to intervene to protect their interests; particularly as the plaintiff and defendant plead that the trust devise of half the estate is void and only differ as to its distribution;\n5. Because Frank Ross, pleading that the will was valid, is estopped from denying the validity of such trusts on the issues with the intervening parties.\nIrving Q.C. and Cook Q.C. for respondent W. R. Ross on both appeals.\nWilliam Russell Ross is admitted to be a poor relation. His interest, however, is barred, in the opinion of both plaintfff and defendant, from the double fact of his having lost money when in partnership with the testator and having owed money to the estate when he died. And so Frank Ross while denying that he is called upon to exercise any discretion, uses what he terms his discretion and excludes his cousin, Rights conferred by the testator, cannot be thus summarily dealt with wtthout a mockery of justice. That James Gibb Ross intended that his poor relations others than his heirs-at-law, should be benefited is proved by this. In 1865 he had but two heirs-at-law apart from Frank, for whom the will provided, and they both were then as wealthy as, if not more wealthy than, J G. Ross himself.\nThe respondent William Russell Ross submits that the judgment of the court appealed from is in all respects right in so far as it affects him, save as to costs He relies on the opinions of Mr. Justice Andrews and of the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, and on the reasons urged by the intervening parties, Morrin College and Finlay Asylum, and prays that the appeals be dismissed with costs in all courts\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014First, as regards the principal action which had for its object a declaration that the will was null and void, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs fail and that the action must be dismissed as against the defendants Frank Ross and Dame Mary Frame, with costs. In other words, I am for affirming the judgment of the Superior Court so far as it relates to the principal action in all respects, except that portion of it which declares the will void as to immovables situate in Ontario, New Brunswick, British Columbia and in the United States. I think the judgment in this last respect was wrong. There was no jurisdiction in the Quebec courts to deal with such immovables, the question of the validity or invalidity of wills as to immovable property being one exclusively for the forum rei sitae. I will not say that the judgment does any harm by this declaration, but it being irregular and without jurisdiction I think the judgment of the Superior Court, and of the Court of Queen's Bench which affirms it should be rectified by striking out all about immovables in Ontario New Brunswick British Columbia and the United States. This would leave the judgment so far as concerns the principal action, a judgment dismissing the action. This dismissal of the action should, for manifest reasons be with costs to Frank Ross and Dame Mary Frame\nMy reasons for this conclusion as to the disposition of the appeal from the judgment in the principal action, are as follows: First, I am of opinion that the rule locus regit actum was not before the enactment of the code (nor since under the code itself art. 7) imperative, hut permsssive only. The jurisprudence is, it is true, contradictory, but Pothier treats it as an unsettled point and such great authorities as Boullenois, Ricard, Masse, Mailher de Chassat, Wharton, Story, Westlake, and I may say all modern writers whose opinions are entitled to weight are in favour of locus regit actum being regarded as permissive only., To hold it to be imperative would be harsh and Unreasonable, entirely at variance with the policy of the law of Lower Canada since the Quebec Act 1774, which favours the exercise of the testamentary power instead of discouraging it, as was the policy of the old law of France, and most arbitrary in making the sufficient execution of a will depend upon the locality of a testator who, whilst in transit\u00fb, makes his will according to the law and forms of his own domicile. Viewed as permissive only the \"rule locus regit actum is, on the other hand, most beneficent and reasonable since it enables a testator who wishes to make an authentic will to avail himself of the notaries and public officers of a foreign country through which he may be passing at a time when he would not be able to avail himself of the instrumentality of the notaries and public officers of his domicile. I therefore conclude that the will was good because made in strict accordance with the law relating to holograph wills prevailing in the province of Quebec in which province the testator was domiciled both at the time of the will and at the time of his death Secondly, I agree with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice in his judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench that even if the rule focus regit actum does apply, yet it sufficiently appears from the evidence, that by the law of the State of New York this will would be considered good as to movables everywhere, and as to immovables in Quebec. Good as to movables wherever situated because it was executed according to the law of the testator's domicile and good as to immovables in the province of Quebec because executed according to the law of the situation of those immovables. Therefore, applying the rule locus regit actum the will was a good will according to the law of the State of New York at least to the extent to which it can properly come under the jurisdiction of the courts of the province of Quebec; that is to say, excluding the immovables situate in the provinces of Ontario New Brunswick and British Columbia, and in the United States\nThen as to the Interventions. As the principal action was to annul the will, and as that action is dismissed, we are not called upon to interpret the legacies to any greater extent than is rendered necessary for the purpose of disposing of the interventions, but to this extent we must interpret it in order to ascertain if the parties had any right to intervene.\nThen the intervention of William Russell Ross must be dismissed because he has no locus standl to maintain it.\nThe gift to \"poor relations i is, according to the terms of the will not an absolute gift to the objects the testator intended to benefit, but rightly interpreted is to be read as conferring upon Frank Ross a faculty of selection amongst persons coming within that description Could William Russell Ross have possibly derived any benefit under this disposition? If it had been in the power of Frank Ross to select him as one of the beneficiaries I should unhesitatingly have agreed with the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in holding that William Russell Ross had a focus slandi to maintain an intervention in favour of the assailed will, though his interest would be contingent and uncertain until Frank Ross should exercise his faculty of selection But according to the interpretation which I put on the description \" poor relations,\" Frank Ross had no power to select this William Russell Ross who was a cousin of the testator only and not one of his heirs-at-law, as a beneficiary under the will. \" Poor relations \" must be interpreted as meanirig \" heirs-at--aw.\" The word \" poor\" is too vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it and must therefore be rejected. The word \" relations,\" then standing alone, must be restricted to some particular class, for if it were to be construed generally as meaning all relatives it would be impossible ever to carry out the directions of the will. The line must therefore be drawn somewhere, and can only be drawn so as to exclude all except those whom the law in the case of an intestacy, recognizes as the proper class among whom to divide the property of a deceased person who dies intestate, namely, his heirs. Then William Russell Ross is not an heir; therefore his intervention must be dismissed with costs to Frank Ross but without costs as regards the plaintiffs and other heirs who contested the intervention on a ground which failed namely that the testamett was null.\nAs regards the intervention of \" Morrin College,\" it does not come within the description of a charitable institution according to the ordinary meaning of the words, for in administering the law of the province of Quebec we have, of course, nothing to do with technical charities under the English law and the statute of Elizabeth. If, therefore Frank Ross were to select Morrin College as a charitable institution entitled to benefits under the will his selection would be unauthorized and void for it does not appear from the record that that seminary of learning is an eleemosynary institution.. Consequently, for the same reason as in the case of William Russell Ross the intervention of Morrin College must be dismissed with costs to Frank Ross.\nAs regards the intervention of Finlay Asylum, it stands on a different ground from the other interventions and must be maintained upon the principle the learned Chief Justice states It would be competent to Frank Ross to select Finlay Asylum as a beneficiary, and this gives that institution a right to intervene for the purpose of supporting the will. Frank Ross fails, therefore, in his contestation in this respect and must pay the costs of the intervention of Finlay Asylum.\nAs I say above, I only interpret the will so far as is necessary for disposing of the interventions. I disclaim any intention of construing its provisions as to these legacies to poor relatives and charities beyond this. I therefore leave opon for future consideration and for a determination in some further action or proceeding if the parties cannot agree, the questions of how far Frank Ross's powers of selection go; whether he can give to some of the heirs and exclude others, or whether he must give something to all; and I would say the same with reference to the charities. Further, the question of whether Frank Ross himself is entitled to benefit as one of the heirs is not in any way prejudiced by the present judgment. The judgment in the principal action must, therefore, be varied by omitting all reference to the immovables outside the province of Quebec and by simply dismissing the action with costs to Frank Ross and Dame Mary Frame. The intervention of William Russell Ross and that of Morrin College must both be dismissed with costs payable to Frank Ross. The intervention of Finlav Asylum must be maintained with costs against Frank Ross.\nAs regards the costs in the Court of Queen's Bench, Frank Ross and Dame Mary Frame are to have their costs of the appeal from the judgment in the principal action and Frank Ross is to have his costs of the appeal in respect of the intervention by William Russell Ross and Morrin College and must pay the costs of the appeal of Finlay Asylum, and in this court the costs must be disposed of in the same way as in the court of Queen's Bench.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'action en cette cause intent\u00e9e par Dame Annie Ross contre Frank Ross et autres, a pour but principal de faire d\u00e9clarer nul le testament olographe de feu James Gibb Ross. Apr\u00e8s avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9 le d\u00e9ces, a Quebec, le ler octobre 1888, du dit feu James Gibb Ross, elle d\u00e9clare que plus d'un an apr\u00e9s le 28 octobre 1839, un testament olographe, date du 8 f\u00e9vrier, 1865, a New-York, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 a sa r\u00e9sidenee, lequel se lit comme suit:\nI. hereby will and bequeath all my property, assets or means of any kind to my brother Frank who will use one half of them for public protestant charities in Quebec and Carluke, say the Protestant Hospital Home, the French-Canadian Mission, and amongst poor relatives, as he may judge best, the other half for himself and for his own use, excepting two thousand pounds which he will send to Miss Mary Frame Overton Farm\n(Sd.) JAMES G. ROSS.\nElle all\u00e9gue ensuite que ce testement est nul, parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait a New-York dans une forme qui n'est pas reconnue par la loi de cet \u00c8tat; elle all\u00e9gue de plus que le d\u00e9fendeur Frank Ross a seul pris possession de la succession en vertu de ce testament, et qu'elle, la demanderesse, ainsi que les autres d\u00e9fendeuss sont les seuls h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes du dit feu James G.. Ross, ayant droit \u00e0 sa succession.\nEn vertu d'un amendement permis plus tard, la demanderesse a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 sa declaration les allegations suivantes, que m\u00eame si ce testament pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 valable dans aucune partie Il \u00e9tait certainement ill\u00e9gal quant \u00e0 tous les immeubles situ\u00e9s en dehors de la province de Quebec, paree que la loi des pays de leur situation, ne reconnaissait pas la validit\u00e9 d'un semblable testament quant aux immeubles, et que quant \u00e0 l'aurre moiti\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 Frank Ross pour \u00eatre distribu\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discretion parmi les institutions charitables, et \u00e0 des parents pauvres, le dit James G. Ross devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ab intestat, attendu que ce legs \u00e9tait nul pour cause d'incertitude. Elle concluait \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 du testament, que le dit Frank Ross fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui livrer un neuvi\u00e8me de la succession, et de plus, \u00e0 lui rendre compte des fruits et revenus.\nFrank Ross et Mary Frame, ont seuls plaide \u00e0 l'action, la validit\u00e9 du testament du dit James Gibb Ross; que ce testament, quoique fait \u00e0 New York, a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9 par le testateur \u00e0 son domicile \u00e0 Quebec, qu'il l'a toujours conserv\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort; ce testament est fait suivant les formalit\u00e9s de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il avait son domicile, et par la loi de New-York, tout testament fait dans cet \u00e9tat, suivant la loi du domicile du testateur, est l\u00e9gal; les d\u00e9fendeuss nient aussi que le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9tat de New-York Les conclusions demandent le renvoi de l'action.\nTous les faits qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de prouver \u00e0 l'appui de cette contestation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis.\nA cette action se sont port\u00e9es parties intervenantes. 10.

Validit\u00e9 du testament de James G. Ross, fait \u00e0 New-York.\n20. Les legs qu'il contient en faveur des institutions charitables et des parents pauvres du testateur, est-il valable?\n30. S'il est nul, \u00e0 qui doivent revenirles biens legu\u00e9s, aux h\u00e9ritiers du testateur, ou \u00e0 son l\u00e9gataire, Frank Ross?\n40. Les intervenants avaient-ils un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour justifier leur intervention dans la cause?\nLe testament ayant Ct\u00e9 fait en 1865, c'est \u00e0 la loi ant\u00e9rieure au code civil de la province de Quebec qu'il faut recourir pour en decider la validit\u00e9. Le testament \u00e9tant dans la forme olographe sa validit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e d'apr\u00e9s les principes de l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais qui.\u00e9tait alors en force dans la province de Quebec.\nL'Honorable Sir Alexandre Lacoste, juge en chef, a discut\u00e9 dans ses savantes notes sur cette cause, les opinions les plus en vogue parmi les auteurs qui out \u00e9crit sur le droit des gens et trait\u00e9 de la validit\u00e9 des testaments faits a l'\u00e9tranger. D'apr\u00e8s ses uns, le testament n'est valide que s'il eat fait selon les formalites requises par Ia loi du lieu de sa confection, d'apr\u00e8s la maxime locus regit actum, Une autre opinion veut Qu'il soit fait suivant la loi du domicile du testateur. La troisi\u00e8me qui est la plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement adoptee, dit-il reconna\u00eet tous les testaments faits en la forme requise, soit l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouve le testateur soit en celle de son domicile.\nApr\u00e9s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue ces diverses opinions et cite beaucoup d'arr\u00eats l'Hon. Juge en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la maxime locus regit actum r\u00e9gissatt le territoire assujetti \u00e0 la coutume de Paris et que d'apr\u00e8s notre droit en 1865 le testament fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger par une personne domicili\u00e9e dans le Bas-Canada devait \u00eatre fait suivant les formes du lieu o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 a peine de nullit\u00e9.\nLe droit ancien a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduit dans l'article 7 de notre code civil qui se lit comme suit;\nLes actes faits ou pass\u00e9s hors du Bas-Canada sont valables, si on y a suivi les formalit\u00e9s requises par les lois du lieu o\u00f9 ils sont passes.\nOn a soutenu \u00e0 l'argument que les testaments olographes n'avaient pas de forme. Certains auteurs sont \u00e9mis cette opinion. Cependant, le grand nombre est d'un sentiment contrarre et la jurisprudence se declare dans leur sens.\nEn nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 notre code civil dit l'Hon. Sir A. Lacoste, nous trouvons que l'article 842 qui a trait aux conditions exig\u00e9es pour la validit\u00e9 des testaments en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et du testament olographe en particulier se trouvent sous la rubrique \" De la forme des testaments.\" Comme le dit Pothier, la forme du testament olographe consiste dans le fait qu'il doit \u00eatre \u00e9crit en entier par le testateur, et sign\u00e9 par lui.\nQuelle est, d'apr\u00e8s la loi de l'\u00e9tat de New-York, lavalidit\u00e9 du testament de James G. Ross fait \u00e0 New-York en 1865? Si ce testament eut \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par un resident de l'\u00e9tat, il serait nul, comme n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u0152 attest\u00e9 par deux t\u00e9moins. Mais l'art. 26 11 du code de procedure de cet Etat, permettant aux \u00e9trangers de faire un testament suivant les formes du pays de leur domicile, ce testament est legal en vertu de cette disposition introduite en faveur des \u00e9trangers. Ce testament enti\u00e8rement \u00e9crit de la main au testateur et signe de liii se trouvant en la forme olographe conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi en force lors de sa date, dans la province de Quebec, est par l'exception de l'art. 2611 de la loi de New-York en faveur des \u00e9trangess, reconnu valable comme le testament d'un \u00e9tranger, autoris\u00e9 par cette loi \u00e0 se servir de la forme de testament de son pays. C'est comme si la loi de New-York avait admis sp\u00e9cialement la forme olographe en faveur des \u00e9trangers, et, en ce sens, c'est par application de la r\u00e8gle focus regit actum, que ce testament doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme valable. Ce testament quoique valable ne peut cependant pas avoir le m\u00e9me effet partout. S'il devait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9tat de New-York, ii ne pouvait avoir d'effet que par rapport aux meubles comme \u00e9tant fait suivant la forme du domicile du testateur. Mais n'\u00e9tant pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en presence de deux t\u00e9moins, il n'aurait aucun effet quant aux immeubles situ\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9tat de New-York. Cependant sa validit\u00e9 comme testament fait d'apr\u00e8s la loi du pays o\u00f9 ii a ete ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 (\u00e0 New-York) n'en est pas affect\u00e9e l'effet seul en est limit\u00e9 suivant la loi du pays o\u00f9 ii est invoqu\u00e9.\nMais dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ses effets comme testament fait d'apr\u00e8s la loi en force ici, et produit tous les effets que la loi en force lui donne.\nOn doit de plus, l'interpr\u00e9ter conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 8, code civil reproduissant l'ancien droit qui veut que\nles actes s'interpr\u00e8tent et s'appr\u00e9cient suivant Ia loi du lieu o\u00f9 ils sont passes, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y est quelque loi \u00e0 ce contraire, que les parties ne s'en soient exprim\u00e9es autrement ou des autres circomstances il n'appparaisse que l'intention n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de s'en rapporter a Ia loi d'un autre lieu; auxquels cas, il est donn\u00e8 effet \u00e0 cette loi ou \u00e0 cette intention exprim\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nLe testament ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en vertu d'une disposition sp\u00e9ciale de la loi de New-York, permettant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger de tester d'apr\u00e8s la loi de son domicile, ce testament doit avoir tout l'effet qu'il aurait eu s'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Au lieu de n'avoir effet que pour les meubles comme s'il \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 New-York ii doit, au contrarre, dans Quebec, s'appliquer \u00e0 toute esp\u00e8ce de biens, soit meubles soit immeubles. Enoutre l'intention \u00e9videnee du testateur \u00e9tait de s'en rapporter \u00e0 la loi de son pays comme le prouve l'\u00e9tendue des termes du testament par lequel il l\u00e8gue tous ses biens sans distinguer entre ses meubles et ses immeubles. Cette intention r\u00e9sulte \u00e9galement des circonstances \u00e9tablies dans Ia cause. be testateur n'\u00e9tait que de passage \u00e0 New-York. Sa fortune se trouvait presque toute enti\u00e8re dans la province de Quebec. Il a de suite envoy\u00e9 son testament \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Se l'\u00e9tant ensuite fait remettre, il l'a garde en sa possession daus la province de Qu\u00e9bec jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9cas.\nJe crois pour toutes ses raisons que le testament doit avoir l'effet d'un testament olographe comme s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec quoique fait \u00e0 New-York.\nQuant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 des legs faits par le testament j'ai le regret de diff\u00e9rer d'avec l'Hon. Sir A Lacoste an sujet des interventions du Morrin College et de W. R. Ross comme parent pauvre.\nbe Morrin College n'es tpas une institution de charit\u00e9. C'est uniquement une maison d'\u00e9ducation. S'il est vrai d'apr\u00e8s quelques auteurs, que quelques-unes-de ces maisons puissent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des institutions de charit\u00e9 il n'en peut \u00eatre ainsi du Morrin College. C'est uniquement une maison d'\u00e9ducation dont l'emploi des revenus est appropri\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re si exclusive \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation qu'elle ne pourrait, sans violer les conditions de sa charte, employer partie dc ses fonds en charit\u00e9.

Ces parents pauvres ne sont aucunement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et ne pourraient \u00eatre reconnus par aucun \u00e9v\u0152nement indiqu\u00e9 par le testateur; l'expression vague et incertaine dont le testateur s'est servi rend leur identification impossible et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nCependant, dans tout legs il y a deux conditions indispensables, une chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, et une personne \u00e0 laquelle la chose est l\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Sur ces deux points la loi requiert que le testateur s'explique avec certitude.

Tout legs fait \u00e0 une personne incertaine dolt \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme nul.

Il suit de l\u00e0 que la validt\u00e9 du legs ne peut d\u00e9pendre de l'arbitraire de l'h\u00e9ritier on d'un tiers, et que le testateur ne peut non plus en ce qui concerne le choix du l\u00e9gataire, le faire d\u00e9pendre du choix de l'h\u00e9ritier on d'un tiers\nL'Hon. Juge qui a dCcid\u00e9 en premiere instance a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans sa savante dissertation sur cette cause les principes souvent formul\u00e9 ainsi qu'il suit:\n1st. It is the certain policy of our law and my clear duty to give effect to the whole will of the testator unless prevented by insuperable difficulties 2nd If the will had not contained the words giving Mr. Frank Ross a discretionary power as to the selection of the particular individual bodies and persons to be benefited, but had simply said that he should give one half of the estate to the public protestant charities of Quebec and Carluke and to poor relatives, I think the law would implv that the distribution between them be an equal distribution 3rd. I think that if Mr. Frank Ross shall refuse or neglect to exercise the discretion vested in him by the will the courts here should not allow such refusal or neglect to defeat the testator's bequest: but as the court lacks the special knowledge which Mr. Frank Ross presumably has of what would have been the distribution which the testaor would have wished it would make no endeavour to exercise any discretion or discrimination beyondl that pointed out by the lines of the will itself and would therefore distribute the testator's bountv equally among all the individuals composed in the category or class of beneficiaries therein designated.\nLe premier de ces principes est admis. Il n'en est pas de m\u00e9me de deux autres. Il n'est certainement pas correct de dire que si le testament n'avait pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Frank Ross le pouvoir de faire lui-m\u00eame la distributon, elle aurait lieu par parts \u00e9gales d'apr\u00e8s la loi i et que dans le cas ou ii refuserait d'exercer les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s la cour en ferait la distribution Cette distributon egale ne peut avoir lieu qu'entre successibles au m\u00eae degr\u00e9 mais entre parent \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents degres les plus prochs exeluent les plus \u00e9loign\u00e9s. Si Frank Ross d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans avoir fait la distribution la cour ne pourrait en ordonner une distribution \u00e9gale entre les parents, car les tribunaux dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec ne poss\u00e8dent aucun pouvoir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La 34 Geo. 3 tout en conf\u00e9rant \u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi remplac\u00e9e par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, la juridiction de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de Paris, a cependant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'aucun pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par aucune cour avant la Conqu\u00eate n'\u00e9tait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour du Bane du Roi\nLa cause du testament de Dame Anne &c., Beau-voisin ([105]), cit\u00e9e dans le factum de l'appelant, qui avait laiss\u00e9 le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens aux pauvres honteux qui seront choisis par les ex\u00e9cuteuss testamentaires se rapportant an choix des pauvres \u00e0 leur discr\u00e9tion, est une de ces causes o\u00f9 les cours par l'exercice de leur pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif substituait leur volont\u00e9 \u00e0 celle du testateur. C'est en vertu de ce pouvoir que la cour ordonna que la moiti\u00e9 du r\u00e9sidu des biens serait divis\u00e9e entre les h\u00e9ritiers suivant l'ordre dans lequel ils auraient succ\u00e9d\u00e9 si la succession avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ab iutestat et l'autre moiti\u00e9 \u00e0 l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris et aux pauvres do l'aum\u00f4ne do Lyon. Quoique cette distribution soit contrarre au testament on voit cependant que dans la moiti\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e aux parents, la cour a suivi l'ordre de succession. Il en doit \u00eatre de m\u00eame dans le cas d'un legs faits aux pauvres parents. C'est l'ordre de succession qu'il faudrait suivre. D'autres causes de ce genre sont cit\u00e9es mais elles sont comme celleci, fond\u00e9es sur I'exercice du pouvoir legislatif de ces cours.\nMaintenant en France les legs faits aux pauvres on pour des fins de charit\u00e9 sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faits au bureau de Bienfaisance de ia Commune. Nous n'avons aucune institution de cc genre dans notre province. Parmi les nombreuses institutions de charit\u00e9 existant dans le pays aucune n'est autoris\u00e9e par Ia loi \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer et administrer les legs pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits par ces objets.\nConsid\u00e9rant le legs fait aux parents pauvres comme absolument nul pour cause d'incertitude, je suis d'avis que W. R. Ross n'avait aucun droit diintervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et que son intervention doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nLe jugement doit aussi \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 dans cette partie qui condamne le d\u00e9fendeur Frank Ross \u00e0 remettre et livrer \u00e0 Ia demanderesse un neuvi\u00e8me indivis des biens de la succession situ\u00e9e en dehors de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, savoir dans Ia province d'Ontario, New Brunswick, la Colombie Anglaise, et les Etats-Unis, parce qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que le dit d\u00e9fendeur en ait jamais eu possession; cette partie du jugement doit \u00eatre retranch\u00e9e; en outre, la cour n'avait aucune juridiction pour decider sur l'effet de cc testament dans les provinces cidessus nomm\u00e9s. Le testament attaqu\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 bon et valide, et l'action renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens ainsi que les interventions du Morrin College et de W. R. Ross, aussi avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent, I would allow the appeal There is, however, one of the questions of law arising in the case upon which I agree that the conclusion reached by the judgment appealed from is entirely correct. That is, as to the absolute nullity of Ross's will by the law of the province taken alone and exclusively of the New York statute. The learned Chief Justice, Sir Alexander Lacoste, has so amply demonstrated the soundness of the doctrine unanimously adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench on this part of the case, that I would have thought it unassailable. The respondent, however, not quite sure perhaps of his position on the other question in the case, to which I shall presently refer, upon which he succeeded before the Court of Queen's Bench in having the will in question maintained, has strenuously argued before us, as he had a perfect right to do, that this will is valid by the law of the province independently of the New York law. and that the Court of Queen's Bench's judgment to the contrary is erroneous. Under the circumstances, though I feel that I cannot add anything to the strength of the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, I have thought that the respondent was entitled to expect at our hands a full review of the question.\nIt is a general rule; in relation to forms of acts or deeds, that forms prescribed merely for the purpose of facilitating the solemnization of an act or deed are facultative or optional, but that forms necessary to their validity, as those for wills all are, must imperatively be complied with. In accordance with this principle, besides other reasons, the jurisprudence was uniform in France, before the Code Napoleon, that the rule locus regit actum, reenacted by art. 7 of the Quebec code, imperatively governed wills made in foreign countries, including holograph wills.\nLaurent ([106]), answers the opinions expressed to the contrary by the German writer Savigny, and a few others whom Wharton, Conflict of Laws, 585-588 681 calls modern Roman jurists, upon whose writings the respondent has almost exclusively to rely in support of his impeachment of the conclusion reached by the court of Queen's Bench on this point. Not a single case has been cited by him in support of his contention. On the contrary, 1 find that as far back as in 16-0 in a case of Pinard v. Andras ([107]), the Parliament of Paris held that a holograph will made in Bruxelles by a Frenchman domiciled in Paris was absolutely null because the Belgian law did not allow that form of will The same doctrine was followed by the same high court in 1720 m the case of d'Argelos ([108]), in 1721 in the case of Pommereu ([109]) and in 1722 in the case of Boisel ([110]) These cases are all noted with an acte de nolori\u00e9l\u00e9, in the same sense, se Paulo, in Guyot ([111]), where the author adds, page 166, that\u2014\nIt cannot be seriously contended that the formalities required by law for a will are personal and are carried with the person everywhere.\nThe Pommereu case, reported at length in 7 Journal des Aud. 515 commented upon by Merlin ([112]) is precisely in point. The will there in question had been made in the holograph form by a testator whose domicile was in Paris, while he was temporarily in Douay where holograph wills were not legal. The argument in support of the will was, as it is here on the part of the respondent, that as it was in the form allowed by the testator's domicile it was valid; that the testator carried everywhere with his person the right to make a holograph will; that the contrary doctrine is irrational and inconvenient; that a holograph will has no forms &c, &c.\nAgainst the will it was argued that a will null by the law of the place where it was made is null everywhere even if made according to the law of the testator's domicile; that it is an error to say that the option to make a will either in one form or in another is attached to the person and carried with the person everywhere.\nThe question it will be seen by this short extract of the report of the case, was fully argued on both sides, and the result was, as stated, that the highest court of the Kingdom declared the will null.\nIn another case, re Millot, on the 15th July 1777, a holograph will, made in Paris by a testator domiciled in a place where such wills were not legal, was held valid. And on the 15th Pluv. and 20th August 1806, by two arr\u00eats, a will made in Bordeaux where holograph wills were not legal, by a testator domiciled in Paris where such wills were legal, was declared void. The leading commentators under the old system adopted the same doctrine.\nAuzanet, on art. 289 of the Coutume de Paris, says:\u2014\nWhat of a will by a Frenchman in Italy in England, in Spain or any other foreign country in the form required by the lex loci? Held that it is valid even for the properties situated in France. And if the will is not made according to the form required by the law of the country where it is made, it must be declared null, even if it is made in conformity with the laws of the country where the property devised is situated and that as to immovables as well as to movables.\n\"The formalities for a will,\" says Bourjon ([113]). \" are those required by the law of the place where it is made.\" And Ricard ([114]) says that the question whether it is fez domicilii or the fez \/oci or the lex rei sit\u00e6 which is to govern the formalities of a will had formerly been a subject much discussed, but that it is now settled by a uniform jurisprudence that the formalities must exclusively be those required by the law of the place where the will is made.\nTroplong ([115]), answers what Ricard says to the contrary in another part of his writings which is also commented upon in the Pommereu case I have referred to Ferri\u00e8re Grand Coutumier ([116]) Rosseau de la Oombe ([117]), Furgole ([118]), all adopt the same doctrine, and recognize that the law is authoritatively settled in that sense.\nIn France, now, under art 999 of the Code Napoleon, and in Louisiana under art. 1588 of their Code a holograph will, according to the French form, made in a foreign country is valid whether the law of that foreign country authorizes it or not, but that provision is no where to be found in the Quebec Code. That it has been deliberatelv left out there can be no doubt. The drafters had constantly before them in the course of their labours the enactments of those two Codes and they did not adopt a single article without maturely weighing the changes thereby made in the law and closely scrutinizing their corresponding enactments, yet they entirely omitted this provision that a holograph will may be legally made anywhere.\nThis, to my mind, is as conclusive on the question as if the code had decreed expressly that a holograph will cannot he made in any foreign country where such a form of will is not allowed and that such had always been the law in the province.\nA reference to the leading commentators under the Code Napol\u00e9on also supports that view.\nMarcad\u00e9 ([119]), says:\nC'est uniquement la loi du pays o\u00f9 l'acte se fait qui doit en r\u00e9gir la. forme, locus regit actum. D'apr\u00e9s ce principe un fran\u00e7ais ne pourrait tester valablement en la forrne olographe que sur le territoire fran\u00e7ais-ou dans un pays dont la loi admettrait \u00e9galement cette forme de tester. C'est ce qui a en lieu jusqu'a la publication du Code.\nAnd he adds that it was generally admitted by the best commentators and by a uniform jurisprudence. under the old system, that a holograph will made in a country where that form is not known to the law was invalid. Coin-Delisle ([120]) and Demante ([121]) are of the same opinion. I refer also to Journal du Droit International Prive, 1880, p. 381; Dalloz ([122]) says in the same sense:\nIl en est du lieu comme du temps; c'est Ia loi du lieu o\u00f9 le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 qui r\u00e8gle les formalit\u00e9s de cet acts. De l\u00e0 l'adage si connu, locus regit actum. No. 2507. L'application de la r\u00e8gle locus regit actum aux testaments olographes \u00e9tait quelque peu contest\u00e9e sous l'ancienne jurisprudence.* * * Mais l'opinion de Bouhier et de Ricard ne prevalent pas. Furgole * * * et Pothier * * * soutinrent l'opinion contraire. * * * Ces auteurs conciuaient que le testateur quelle que f\u00fbt d'ailleurs sa loi personnelle \u00e9tait capable ou incapable de tester par testament olographe, suivant que cette forme \u00e9tait ou non admise dans le lieu o\u00f9 le testament se trouvait \u00e9crit. Cette th\u00e9orie a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e par quatre arr\u00eats de parlement du 10 mars 1620, 15 janvier 1721, 14 juillet 1722, 15 juillet 1777, par un acte de Notori\u00e9t\u00e9 du Ch\u00e9telet, du 13 septembre 1702, et appuy\u00e9e de i'autorit\u00e9 de Merlin. Ces arr\u00eats avaient fix\u00e9 la jurisprudence d'une mani\u00e8re invariable, et ii ne restait de dissidence dans la doctrine que l'opinion contraire de Boullenois, opinion influenc\u00e9e par une extension syst\u00e9matique st \u00e9videment exag\u00e9r\u00e9e des principes de i'auteur sur les statuts. No.' 2508. Le Code Napoleon ne s'est occup\u00e9 de la maxime locus regit actum que pour la confirmer comme il l'a fait par l'article 999 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du testament authentique tout en la modifiant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du testament olographe accomplis l'un et l'autre par un fran\u00e7ais en pays \u00e9trangers.\nDemolombe ([123]), says:\nIl est vrai que l'article 999 autorise Ie Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 faire un testament olographe suivant la forme fran\u00e7aise dans les pays m\u00e9mes o\u00f9 cette forme ne serait pus admise; mais c'est l\u00e0 une exception que Ia loi fran\u00e7aise a faite en faveur des Fran\u00e7ais afin de leur donner le plus de moyens possibles de faire leur testament en pays \u00e9tranger; exception de faveur, disons-nous, qui ne prouve nullement que les auteurs du Code aient m\u00e9connu le vrai caract\u00e8re de la loi qui autorise cette forms de testament The same author then discusses the assertion of F\u0153lix and Aubry and Rau that the rule locus regit actum is facultative so as to permit the execution of the will either according to the law of the domicile or according to the law of the place of execution, and adds ([124]):\nCette doctrine, sans doute, pourrait para\u00eetre raisonnable, et nous sommes en effet port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu'elle serait, si elle \u00e9tait admise, un prog\u00e8s du droit nouveau sur l'ancien droit. Mais ii faut reconna\u00eere Que l'ancien droit ne l'avait pas admise et nous avons aussi constat\u00e9 ailleurs qu'elle n'a pas encore non plus r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se faire reconna\u00eetre dans notre droit nouveau..\nAt par. 482, in fine, the author says that the doctrine in France before the Code had almost universally pre~ vailed that a holograph will made in a country where that form of will is not recognized, is a nullity, even if the lex domicilii of the testator recognized it. And at par. 106 bis vol. 1, p. 129 thesame author says:\u2014\" Is the rule locus regit actum imperative or merely facultative? \" The question was under the old law much discussed, but, however, the opinion that it was imperative had prevailed. And such is the tendency of our modern jurisprudence.\nLaurent ([125]), says: \u2014\nLa derogation est claire, mais quelle en est Ia port\u00e9e? En fautll conclure que Ia forme des testaments olographes est un statut personnell On l'a pr\u00e9tendu et nous verrons \u00e0 l'instant que cette question de th\u00e9orie a un int\u00e9r\u00eat pratique. Il nous semble oue la difficult\u00e9 n'en est pas une, car les principes les plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentairss sur l'interpr\u00e9tation-des lois suffisent pour Ia decider. Que la loi qui r\u00e9gle les solennit\u00e9s d'un acte ne soit pas une loi personnelle tout le monde en convient; l'opinion de Boullenois et de Bouhier est toujours rest\u00e9e isol\u00e9e. L'article 999 en d\u00e9rogeant \u00e0 l'adage, locus regit actum, a-t-il chang\u00e9 Ia-nature des lois concernant les formes? Il a permis au Fran\u00e7ais de faire un testament olographe d'apr\u00e8s Ia loi fran\u00e7aise dans les pays o\u00f9 cette forme de tester ne serait pas admise Toute exception doit \u00eatre renferm\u00e9e dans les limites de Ia Ioi qui Ta \u00e9tablie L'exception de l'article 999 se borne \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 un Fran\u00e7ais une facult\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas en vertu du droit communi, voil\u00e0 tout. Le statut reste donc ce qu'il \u00e9tait Un statut r\u00e9el.\nThe same writer at par. 245 et seq. vol. 2, droit international, repeats the same doctrine. Also in vol. 1 droit civil 90 et seq., and in vol. 6 droit intern., nos. 415-922, he says of art. 999, Code Napoleon, that the Code has deviated from the old law on the subject and iuaugurated a new principle. In vol. 7 dr. intern. nos. 5 et seo. aie other remarks of the same writer in the same sense.\nAubry and Rau ([126]), though of opinion that the rule locus regit actum is merely facultative and not imperative concede that under the old law the rule was held to be imperative. That it is facultative under art. 999 of the Code Napoleon is unquestionable, but I repeat it, that it is not and never has been law in the province of Quebec; and Boileux ([127]) says:\u2014\nUnder the jurisprudence anterior to the code it was generally admitted that a Frenchman could not validly make a holograph will in a country where that form of will was not legal.\nI refer also to the decisions in De Veine v Rout ledge ([128]) to the same case in Cassation ([129]) and to 3 Troplong ([130]), where it is said that the opinion of Ricard and others to the contrary did not prevail in France before the Code\nAs to the contention faintly urged on the part of the respondent, that the fact that holograph wills have no form and that they need not be dated from any place shows that they can be made anywhere, I need only say that it is one that was propounded long ago by Ricard inter alios, whose opinion is so often wrong, says Troplong, no. 1463 but has never been sustained by any court, and is repudiated expressly by the judgment in the Pommereu case ([131]), to which I have already referred where that same point had been explicitly taken and Merlin calls it a \"subtilit\u00e9.\" The respondent contends that the rule locus regit actum is absurd and irrational. That may or may not be. Laurent ([132]), and Despagnet ([133]), think that it is the English rule that is absurd. With this however, clearly we are not concerned.\nFor these reasons I agree with the Court of Queen's Bench (and we are unanimous on this point I understand though I have not seen my learned colleagues' opinions), that under the law of the province, considered alone and without reference to the New York law, Ross's holograph will made in New York is void,\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, however, have maintained the validity of that will upon the ground that it was made according to the form required by the law of New York and consequently valid under art. 7 of the Quebec Code and the rule locus regit acium. Now as a matter of fact alone, upon the evidence in the record I would say that this will is not made according to the forms required for wills in New York. The experts examined all agree that holograph wills are unknown to the New York law. That should put an end to the controversy. But the conclusion reached by the Court of Queen's Bench on this branch of the case is based upon art. 2611 of the New York Code of Procedure by which it is decreed that:\nA will of personal estate, executed by a person not a resident of the state according to the laws of the testator's residence may be admitted to probate.\nTherefore, they say, Ross's will is made in the New York form as to personal estate.\nI am unable to adopt this reasoning. it rests entirely, it seems to me, on a misconstruction or misapplication of the New York statute. (I cite here the cases of Bremer v. Freeman ([134]) Goncha v. Murrietta ([135]), and City Bank v. Barrow ([136]) as to the construction of a foreign code.) The granting of the probate of a will made under a foreign law is not conclusive and. does not regulate and affect the ultimate destination of the property; Jarman, ([137]); In re Kirwan's Trusts ([138]); Barnes v. Vincent ([139]); Abston v. Abston, ([140]); Atkinson v Rogers ([141]); and ancillary probate may be granted of a will made according to the laws of the foreign domicile of the testator though that will is invalid accordino to the lex fori ([142]).\nIn Thornton v. Curling for instance, reported in England in 8 Sim. 310 and in France in Journal du Pal. 1826, 898, commented upon by the Vice Chancellor in Price v. Dewhurst ([143]) the will there in question had been made in England, in the English form by a testator domiciled in France That will was null according to English law, because not in the form required by the law of the testator's domicile. Yet it was admitted to probate in England 2 Addams, 6, because it was valid as to form in France according to the rule locus regit actum, though eventually the Cour de Cassation in France held its dispositions illegal under the French law. And such a course of dealing would be followed under the same circumstances in New York, I apprehend, as by art, 2624 of that same code, it is only of wills made in the State by residents of the State that the Surrogate determines the validity. By art. 2694 it is expressly enacted that the validity of a will of any personal property situated within the State is regulated by the laws of the State or country of which the decedent was a resident at the time of his death It is only to personal estate in New York that this article can have any application, and it is likewise only to personal estate in New York that art. 2611 is intended to apply It cannot, it is evident have any application in the courts of any foreign country.\nThe form that, under art. 7 of the Quebec Code d\u00e9claratory of the old law, has to be followed by a Quebecer who makes a will in New York is the form required by the law of New York for wills by its own subjects, the form generally used in New York as the last part of art. 999 of the Code Napoleon reproducing the rule locus regit actum expresses in clear terms. And the New York Legislature had not the power to alter that law for the province of Quebec, and to decree that a Quebecer could in New York make his will either according to his lec domicilii or to the lex loci actus, or to neither one nor the other, but according to a mixture of both at least so as to affect movables in Quebec.\nIt cannot be that the legislature of New York had the right to pass a statute in the following terms: \" Whereas by the law of the province of Quebec a holograph will made in New York by a citizen of the province is invalid in Quebec; whereas it is expedient to provide otherwise ' it is hereby decreed that here after such a will shall be valld.\" Could such an enactment affect property in Quebec? I would say not, and the New York legislature never intended to do so. To give to their statute the meaning that the respondent contends for would be to extend it in a. manner not justified by any principle of law that I. know of. The respondent, in other words, would argue, at least his argument leads to it, that though the legislature in Quebec has refused to adopt the change in the law made in this respect as to holograph wills by art. 999 of the Code Napoleon or by art. 1588 of the Louisiana Code, yet the New York legislature has done it for them.\nTo so contend is evidently to forget the sovereignty of the province and of the law of the domicile of the testator in the matter and leads to a reasoning in a circle And a safe rule that I would apply here is the one laid down by Lord Penzance in a somewhat analogous case, Pechell v. Hilderly ([144]) that in determining the question whether such a will is valid or not, regard can be had to the law of one country alone at a time and the court will not mix up the legal precepts of different countries. The law of Quebec is exclusively the rule here. But were it necessary to make the inquiry, it seems to me established in the case that the will would be held invalid in New York.\nMr. Adams, one of the experts examined in the case, makes this point clear and I do not see that he is contradicted by the other experts. As in England, in matters of testate succession when the will has been made by a person dying with a foreign domicile, inquiry is made in New York, I assume, with regard to the validity of that will by the law of the domicile and .according to the result of such inquiry, probate of the will is granted or rejected. Art. 2694 New York Code of Procedure ([145]).\nUpon evidence that by the Quebec law a holograph will made in New. York by a citizen of Quebec is not valid in Quebec to transmit property real or personal situated or to be found in Quebec if, by the New York law, holograph wills by citizens of New York are not valid in New York, this will in question here would not be admitted to probate in New York.\nThis art. 2611 of the New York Code of Procedure does not cover this will as it applies only to a will of personal property executed by a person not a resident of the State according to the laws of the testator's residence. And Ross's will is not executed accordino* to the laws of the testators's residence\nIt was said at the argument on the part of the respondent, this will is good by the Quebec law, it is also good by the New York law why should it not be upheld? This is, however, but an assumption of the very question at issue. That is precisely what has to be determined, whether this will is valid or not * and to such an argument the appellants have only to answer with not more but with as much force, by saying that as the will is bad in Quebec, and also bad in New York it cannot be upheld. If Ross had left personal estate in New York, and the New York Court upon contestation of his will had referred the question of its validity to the Quebec courts, following the course adopted by the Prerogative Court in England in de Bonneval's case ([146]), to have the question settled by Ross's lex domicilii, the Quebec courts would have had to answer, and the Court of Queen's Bench concedes it, that by Ross's lex domicilii alone and independently of the New York law, the rule locus regit actum imperatively governs, and that this will by that law is therefore null; that by the Quebec law a Quebecer, who in New York desires to make a will disposing of either movables or immovables, or both in Quebec must do so according to the New York forms And as a holograph will is not in the New York form, that would have been the end of this controversy, as art. 2694 of the New York Code of Procedure, above referred to, expressly says that as to personal estate it is by Ross's lex domicilii that in New York the validity of his will is to be concluded. I utterly fail to understand the import of the rule locus regit actum, if it does not mean, adapting it to this case, that a Quebecer who desires when in New York to make a will has to make it according to the form required by the law of New York for its own subjects; or to put it in other words, if a will in the holograph form made by a New Yorker in New York is void under the New York law in New York, a Quebecer's will in that form made in New York is also void in Quebec, which is Ross's lex domicilii.\nThis art 2611 of the New York Code, relied upon by the Court of Queen's Bench to maintain this will, requires no form at all for any will in the sense that the word \" requires s bears in art. 7 of the Quebec Code. It is a mere enabling enactment as to probate when a foreign testator has left personalty in the State of New York. The form that is required by the New York law for New York citizens for a will made in the State of New York is the form derived from the English law of a \"will before witnesses All that this article of the Code of Procedure enacts is that a will made by a non-resident of the State of movables to be found in the State may be admitted to probate if made according to the law of the testator's residence. It does not purport to legalize any will otherwise illegal. It merely decrees that probate may be granted in New York, as to personalty, of any will that is legal by the law of the foreign testator's residence. It does not at all help any will, or in any way come to the assistance of any will, that is not perfectly legal by the law of the testator's residence and by that law alone. The fact that Ross's will happens to have been made in New York does not make the least difference The article does not merely apply to wills made in New York; it has the same application to a will made for instance in England by a Frenchman domiciled in Paris or in Paris by an Italian or to bring the illustration closer to the present case to Ross's will if it had been made in England. If, under such a will, the testator had disposed of movables in New York, and probate was in consequence demanded in New York, the New York court would grant probate if the will is good by the law of the testator's residence exclusively and refuse it if the will is had by that same law. Such is the New York law. In the Marquis de Bonneval's case above cited a Frenchman had made his will in England in the English form. The court in England ([147]), held that by the English law the validity of that will as to personalty in England had to be determined by the law of France the lex domicilii of the testator and accordingly referred the case to the French courts to ascertain what that law was. Thereupon the Court of Cassation in France where the case was eventually carried, determined ([148]), that, by the French law, that will made in England, irrespectively of the question of the testator's domicile by a French subject in the English form was good under the common law and art. 999 of the Code Napoleon, which decrees, in express words, that a Frenchman in a foreign country may make his will in the forms recognized (usit\u00e9es) in that country, reenacting thereby the rule which had always governed in France and which is reproduced in art. 7 of the Quebec Code, as I have already remarked. But if instead of being a will in the English form de Bonneval's will had been a holograph will the courts in France would unquestionably before the Code have held it utterly void as they did for the Pinard Andras, the d'\u00c1rgelos, the Pommereu and the de Boisel wills and the other wills in the cases that I have cited\nThis enactment of the New York code, art. 2611, upon which the respondent bases this branch of his argument is, it seems to me, nothing more than a re-enactment of the English common law; Bremer v. Freeman ([149]); Croker v. The Marquis of Hertford ([150]). Now would Ross's holograph will have been good according to Quebec law if made in England? That is the same question undoubtedly. The law of England, as I have said is the same as the law of art. 2611 of the New York Code Would not the courts in France, before the Code Napoleon, have held such a will null as they did in the above cited cases? Upon an application for probate of Ross's will, if it had been made in England the court in New York would not have Proceeded before inquiring what was Ross's lex domicilii, and upon ascertaining that by that lex domicilii a holograph will made in England by one of its subjects is void, as the English law does not know of holograph wills, probate would have been refused.\nThe New York article can apply only to wills made by a subject of a foreign country, or of any other State of the Union where the English law on this subject prevails, that is to say where by the testator's lex domicilii, he carries everywhere with his person the right to make a will in the forms prescribed by the law of his own country, a doctrine which to use Guyot's words in the psssage I have cited cannot be \u00a1Seriously contended for under the French common law. With the law on the subject under,the English system there is in the New York law no conflict with the law under the French system there is conflict. It has been said that it would be an anomaly if this will was held to be valid in New York and invalid in the province of Quebec. But anomalies of this kind assuming that the New York courts might uphold the validity of this will, are constantly met with. It is the inevitable result of the differences between the municipal laws of the different countries of the civilized world. In a case of Guigonand v. Sarrazin ([151]) for instance a will made in Austria was declared null by the French courts though it had been held valid by the Austrian courts. In a case of Meras v. Meras ([152]), a holograph will made in France by a Spaniard was held good by the French courts, though it had been held bad by the Spanish courts. And an English subject, temporarily in France, may, by the French law make a holograph will in France and such a will will affect both movables as well as immovables situated in France. Re Quartin ([153]); Meras v. Meras (2). But in England such a will at common law would have been invalid; Croker v. the Marquis of Hertford ([154]); Bremer v. Freeman ([155]); as to both movables and immovables. And a will in the English form made in France by an Englishman domiciled in England, is null in France both as to movables and immovables ([156]). See Mendes v. Brandon ([157]).. It is good in England as to both. In re Rippon ([158]); In re Raffenel, ([159]); Doglioni v. Crispin ([160]). \"Attendu,\" says the Cour de Cassation, in Re Browning (6), declaring the nullity of a will in the English form made in France by an Englishman: Qu'il est de principe de droit international que la forme ext\u00e9rieure des actes est essentiellement soumise aux lois, usages et coutumes des pays o\u00f9 ils sont pass\u00e9s;; que ce principe s'applique aux testaments olographes comme tous autres actes publics et priv\u00e9s.. Attendu que si tout ce qui tient \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat du testateur, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue et \u00e0 la limite de ses droits et de sa capacit\u00e9 est r\u00e9gi par le statut personnel qui suit la personne partout ou elle se trouve, il en est autrement de la solennit\u00e9 de l'acte et de sa forme ext\u00e9rieure qui sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par Ia loi du pays o\u00f9 le testateur dispose. Qu'ainsi le testament olographe fait par un \u00e9tranger en France, et dont l'ex\u00e9cution est demand\u00e9e devant les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cla\u00e9e valable qu'autant qu'il r\u00e9unit toutes les conditions de forme exig\u00e9es parla l\u00e9gislation fran\u00e7aise, quelle que soit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la legislation du pays auquel appartient le testateur.\nThe consid\u00e9rants of the same court re Quartin and of the Paris Court of Appeal, in Mendes v. Brandon, cited above, are as strong and clear in the same sense.\nOn the same principle it is held in France that a \u00edoint will, although null if made in France is valid in France if it is made by foreign consorts in their domicile of origin, according to the law of the place even for immovables ([161]).\nA case of Whall v.. Van Often ([162]) goes very far in support of the same doctrine. There, a holograph will made in France by a Dutchman was declared valid as to the personal estate left by the testator in France though by the Holland Code holograph wills are not merely not allowed, but prohibited; so that the estate in France went to the legatees under the will and the -estate in Holland went to the heirs at law the court unequivocally repudiating, as they did in the Meras case cited before, the preponderance of the foreign law over the municipal law of the country that in the present case, the doctrine of the Court of Queen's Bench would concede to the New York law over the law of the province of Quebec. These examples demonstrate that no rules or principles of private international law, upon which the respondent partly bases his contentions on this point, can have any bearing on this case. There are on the question no rules ex comitate between States or ad reciprocavi ulililatem that can be given effect to in the courts of justice. Each country, as the cases I have quoted demonstrate, follows its own law in each case without reference to the foreign law.\nIn Dupuy v. Wurtz ([163]), for another instance, a citizen of New York made his will in France bequeathing both real and personal property in the form recognized by the State of New York. That will was clearly null in toto in France. But the New York Code held it good in toto ([164]).\nA New Yorker, who whilst temporarily in Quebec, desires to make a will, has by the New York law\" to make it according to the New York form to devise his real estate in New York and if he desires to bequeath any estate, real or personal, situate in Quebec, he must, by the Quebec law, make another will accordingg to the Quebec forms. But a will by a Quebecer in the New York forms, whilst temporarily in New York, will, by the Quebec law, pass his real and personal estate in Quebec, and, by the New York law both his real and personal estate in New York. And in this Dominion itself the same divergence exists in the laws between the different provinces, at least between the province of Quebec and the English law provinces. A will made in Quebec, for instance under the French law form does not affect real estate in Ontario but a will made in Ontario under the Ontario form affects real estate in Quebec This shows that international law has nothing to do with the question. In Louisiana, in 1848, in Re M. Candless ([165]) it was held that under the civil law in force in thiat State the form of the will is to be decided according to the law of the place where made whether it relates to movables or immovables situated in another country, whatever principles to the contrary may prevail in countries governed by the English common law, and consequently a will of movables and immovables situated in the. state, made in another country by a citizen of the state, temporarily there according to the forms of that other country was declared valid. This Louisiana decision rendered under the same system of law that rules the province of Quebec, is a striking instance of the difference between the English and the French law on the subject, a difference which we must constantly bear in mind in determining this case.\nUnder the English law the rights that attach to the person and are carried with him everywhere, under the rule mobilia personam sequuntur, include, as to personality the right to make a will in the form of the testator's lex domicilii. Under the French law that rule does not extend to forms of wills; this righ of a testator is not included in the rights that attach to the person and the laws as to forms of deeds or wills are statuts r\u00e9els, not statuts personeels.\nAnother great difference between the two is that under the French system the rules for the forms of wills are the same for movables as for immovables. Laurent ([166]); Pothier ([167]); Ier Boileux, page 22; Quartin's case, cited above, and Annotator's remarks; whilst under the English system the lex rei sitae strictly prevails as to realty. It does not necessarily follow, however, (under both systems probably) that a will to be valid in form must conform to that law which would have regulated the succession to the testator's property if he had died intestate, as said per Sir John Nicholl in England, in Curling v. Thornton ([168]) and as results from the judgment of the Cour de Cassation in France in re Quartin above cited on the first ground of the pourvoi.\nIn Bremer v. Freeman ([169]) the Privy Council held that by the French law an Englishman domiciled in France, though not naturalized, cannot validly by a will made in France in the English form bequeath movable property in England. The French courts would unquestionably have also held the will in question in that case void, as, under any circumstances, by the French law, is a will in the English form made in France, even by an Englishman domiciled in England, valid either as to movables or as to immovables whilst by the English law, such a will made in France by an Englishman domiciled in England is valid and, in fact, as to real estate in England, the only one that an English court would recognize. The French law had in that case been misconstrued in the Prerogative Court ([170]).\nThe respondent's argument by which he relies on the private international law in force in New York to uphold Ross's will is based on the same fallacy as his argument by which he tries to uphold it on the New York Code of Procedure ([171]). It is a petitio principit. It assumes that the will is good by the Quebec law. It is merely an argument that could be invoked if Ross's will had been made in Quebec. Then it would unquestionably he good in Quebec both as to movables and immovables, and good by the New York law to transmit personal property in New York. It is a setfled principle of private international law that the formalities reoquired. for a deed or an instrument of any kind, are those required by the law of the place where the deed or instrument is made. Locus regit actum; Journ de dr. intern. priv\u00e9, 1883, p. 85. The respondent's argument begs the whole question and assumes that this holograph will made in New York is just as valid by the Quebec law as if it had been made in Quebec. In other words it assumes that art. 999 of the Code Napoleon is not new law, and that the rule locus regit actum is not law in Quebec, both of which propositions are untenable.\nI would come to the conclusion that Ross's will is void but in any case I do not see how it can affect immovables in Quebec. It is only as to movables that the New York statute, in express terms, legalizes a devise by a foreigner made according to his lex domicilii, and Ross's will, it is conceded, would not affect immovables situated in New York, if he had left any. If he had devised his immovables only clearly his will would not be admitted to probate in New York. On what principle it can be made to extend to immovables in Quebec I cannot see. The intentions of the testator are to he given effect to, it is said. Certainly, but that is so only of the intentions that he has expressed in a valid will, and so far only as such will is valid If intention alone was to be given effect to there would be no need for any form. If a will is valid as to movables the testator's movables will pass under it but if invalid as to immovables these immovables are left intestate.\nSuch was the result of the two cases before the Privy Council of Meiklejohn v. The Attorney General ([172]), and Migneautt v. Malo ([173]), in both of which, though the testators had clearly disposed of both their movables and immovables, yet the wills were held valid as to movables only. To use the words of Lushington J. in\nCroker v. The Marquis of Hertford ([174]):\nWe sit here not to try what the testator may have intended, but to ascetain on legal principles what testamentary instrument he has made.\nAnd in France it is said on the same principle:\nLa solennit\u00e9 des testaments qui est de droit public est de beaucoup plus grande et plus puissante consid\u00e9ration que l'entret\u00e8nement de Ia derni\u00e8re volont\u00e9 d'un particulier. Brodeau sur Lou\u00ebt, vol. 2, p. 754.\nIn this very case it is evident that Ross's intention was to bequeath all his immovable property wherever situated. Yet it is conceded that his will does not cover the immovables he left in Ontario.\nThe only point that now remains for my consideration in this case is the view taken by the Superior Court that this will is valid as made in the English form as it was introiuced in the province in 1774. Now, under the Statute of Frauds, the English law in force in Quebec in 1865 when this will was made, nothing but personal estate could be devised by a holograph will.. And here again the judgment should in any case be reformed so as to maintain this will only as to the personal estate of the testator. But I go further, and I think with what may be assumed to have been the unanimous opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench, that this will as an English will, is null in toto. By the English law, different in this again from the French law ([175]) the will speaks at the death of the testator and it is the law at the time of Ross's death that governs the execution of his will. Now, by that law art 851 of the Code in force when Ross died wills derived from the English form both as to movables and immovables must, as now in England, be executed before witnesses. Art.2613 C.0. invoked by the respondent against this has no application. That it is the law at the time of the death that governs the wills derived from the English law and its execution is no new rule in the Code. And that article relates only to new rules or changes made in the law by the Code so as not to affect past transactions or acquired rights. And when article 581 decrees that thereafter all such wills must be executed before witnessses, that applies to the wills of all those who died after the comino into force of the Code.\nI would allow Annie Ross's appeal and maintain her action. Consequently, and also for the reasons given by my brother Fournier, I would dismiss all the interventions with costs on all the issues and allow Frank Ross's appeal with costs on the appeal between him and those intervening parties. I remark that in the formal judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench there is no reference to these interventions or any of them. However, this has no consequence.\nAs to Frank Ross's appeal or cross-appeal as between him and the plaintiff, there should be a reformation at least of that part of the judgment by which he is condemned to deliver up the real estate left by the testator outside of the province of Quebec and to render an account of his administration thereof It is established that he never had possession of that real estate. The admission in the record relates only to the estate devised by the will, and the realty outside of the province, it is conceded, did not pass by the will. How can he deliver up what he never had, or render an account of an administration which he never had?\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur with the learned Chief Justice in this case except as to that part of the judgment relating to Morrin College, whose intervention in my opinion should be maintained as that of a charity within the terms of the will, and except as to costs in the lower courts. I think that the order of the Supeiror Court and the order of the Court of Queen s Bench as to costs should stand except as to the interventions dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice except as to costs in the lower courts. The orders in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Superior Court should stand except as to the interventions which have been dismissed.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant Frank Ross : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitor for appellants Annie Ross, et al : Eugene Lafleur.\nSolicitors for respondents, Morrin College, Finlay Asylum and W.

Prior to the year 1881, one Colin Fraser was in possession of a portion of unsurveyed lands of the Crown, now within the limits of the Town of Edmonton; his possession was that of a mere squatter, without title, but making claim to be recognised by the Crown under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act as an actual settler upon such land. It appears that seven other persons were in like manner and at the same time in possession of other lands adjoining the land of which the said Colin Fraser was so in possession. On the 9th of February, 1881, the said Colin Fraser by an agreement in writing signed by him, agreed to sell to one James McDonald \" all the right and interest of him the said Colin Fraser, in that part of his claim situate on the east side of his ploughing,\" and fronting on the main travelled road, which is described in the agreement as follows : \" Beginning at a point three feet east from my ploughing, and extending eastward along the main travelled road fifty (50) feet; thence northward parallel with the ploughing aforesaid one hundred (100) feet; thence west-ward to within three (3) feet of the ploughing aforesaid fifty feet; thence southward to the main road one hundred feet.\" And the said Colin Fraser thereby agreed to furnish to the said James McDonald a clear deed of the above described lots \"as soon as the government surveys thereof are made.\" Upon the same 9th February James McDonald transferred all his interest in the said piece of land to the defendants, Brown & Curry.\nThe main travelled road mentioned in the above description, the northern limit of which was made the southern limit of the piece of land above described, had then no defined width or boundaries, nor could it have any legally defined limits, as indeed appears from the very terms of the agreement, until the Government surveys should be made. The only road which then was there, was a \"trail\" which, as is alleged in the defendants' statement of defence, ran along what constitutes the centre line of what is now called Jasper avenue. At or about the same time as Colin Fraser agreed to sell all his interest in the above de-scribed piece of land to James McDonald, he in like manner agreed to sell all his interest in several other pieces of the land of which he was so as aforesaid in possession, to persons respectively named Oliver, Kelly, Sanderson and Lorby, Hogarth and Lauder, and his interest in all the residue of the said land of which he was so in possession to one Samuel Pritchard. In the year 1882 one Deane, a Dominion Land Surveyor, was employed by the Dominion Government to make a survey of what is called the Edmonton Settlement in the North-west Territory. Upon that survey he laid down on a plan the several pieces of land of which the said Colin Fraser and the six other persons in possession of lands adjoining the land of which he was so possessed, and in such plan the name of S. Pritchard is entered as the person in possession of the whole lot, which is on the plan numbered as river lot no. 10 of the Edmonton Settlement survey. This plan was, upon the 26th May, 1883, approved and con-firmed under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act in that behalf.\nUpon this plan there is laid down with dotted lines the northern and southern limits of the road across the said river lot No. 10 and the other neighbouring lots. The surveyor's notes of survey have not been produced showing the width of the road intended to be designated by such dotted lines, but the plan is made upon a scale of twenty chains to an inch, and by the application of such a scale to the space between the dotted lines inclusive of the dots, it appears to exceed one chain. Now prior to the 1st of January, 1883, Pritchard had a survey and plan made for him of the whole of the said river lot no. 10, but divided into town lots wherein were represented the several pieces thereof which had been agreed to be sold by Fraser to divers persons as well as several other lots wherein the names of other persons were entered, presumably persons to whom Pritchard him-self had agreed to sell such pieces. On this plan Jasper avenue is laid down as being of the width of eighty feet, and another street called Fraser avenue extending northerly through the lot from Jasper avenue. Upon the plan the name of Brown is entered upon a lot designated on the plan as being fifty feet in width, abut-ting on the northerly limit of Jasper avenue, and extending in a northerly direction 100 feet the south-westerly angle of which lot is placed as being 119 feet easterly from the south-easterly angle of the street called Fraser avenue, that is from the intersection of the easterly limit of Fraser avenue with the northern limit of Jasper avenue. This survey and the plan thereof were made by Geo. A, Simpson, a Deputy Land Surveyor, as and for a \"subdivision of river lot no. 10.\" \"Pritchard estate,\" and it is called \"Plan A,\" \"Edmonton,\" and was registered upon the 15th of March, 1886, under the provisions of the Northwest Territories Registration of Titles Ordinance, 1884, as appears by a copy certified by the registrar. Up to this time no patent had issued for any part of the said river lot no. 10, but on or about the 25th January, 1886, the before named Oliver, Kelly, Sanderson and Lorby, Colin Fraser, Hogarth and Lauder and the defendants, Brown and Curry signed under their respective hands and seals, a petition to the Minister of the Interior wherein, alleging themselves to be severally entitled to different portions of river lot number 10 in Edmonton according to the Dominion Government survey, which different portions compose in the whole the lands embraced in an accompanying description and shewn on an accompanying plan, they requested and consented that letters patent should issue for the whole of the lands so embraced in such description, and plan, to John Brown, of Edmonton, in the District of Alberta, in the Northwest Territories of Canada, Merchant, as trustee, and they requested that the patent should be forwarded to Mr. Robert Strachan, Edmonton, Solicitor.\nUpon the 27th January, 1886, Mr. Strachan forwarded this petition to the minister with statutory declarations made by Colin Fraser and James McDonald respectively, in the former of which Fraser declared that the above named parties were all the persons who were applying for patent to issue to John Brown, that he had not sold any of the said lands for which the patent was so applied for to any person, that any other sales he had made were entirely distinct from the lands described in a description accompanying his declaration, that the piece described as his own was a piece he had previously sold to, but afterwards. purchased from James McDonald, who in his declaration confirmed this latter statement, and also declared that the lot marked on the accompanying plan \"J. Brown\" was purchased by him from Fraser and subsequently sold to John Brown and D. S. Curry, and he also declared that the description accompanying the declaration did not in any way encroach upon the lands of the Rev. Samuel Pritchard. This petition and the plan, descriptions and declarations ac-companying the same, together with the letter of Mr. Strachan of the 27th January were received in the Department of the Interior on the 11th February, 1886, and in reply thereto a letter from the department to Mr. Strachan was addressed and sent upon the 16th March, 1886, wherein Mr. Strachan upon behalf of the petitioners was informed that \"before any further consideration could be given to the matter of the petition a tracing of a plan to be prepared as thereinafter stated, must be filed in the department, and that upon the receipt of such tracing the question as to the propriety of issuing patents direct to the several parties who purchased parts of the lot in question from Mr. Colin Praser for their respective portions thereof, will be further considered.\" The directions given for further preparation of the required plan were as follows: \"1st. It must show river lot 10 as it is-shown on a plan of the survey of the Edmonton Settlement made by Mr. Deane, a Dominion Land Surveyor. 2ndly. It must be pre-pared by a Dominion Land Surveyor on a scale of one chain to an inch and be certified in the usual manner by such surveyor; 3rdly. It must have indorsed on it a certificate of the registrar of the district to the effect that it is a record in his office; 4thly. The tracing to be filed in this department must be certified by the said registrar to be a true and correct copy of the above mentioned plan.\"\nIn accordance with these directions, Mr. Strachan on behalf of the petitioners had a plan pre-pared by Geo. A. Simpson, the Dominion Land Surveyor, who in 1882 had surveyed and made the plan for Mr. Pritchard. This plan which bears date the 18th of August, 1886, and is designed \" A. 1,\" and was duly certified by the said Geo. A. Simpson and registered in the registry office on the 28th August, 1886, was for-warded to the Department of the Interior, and upon it were marked, the boundaries of the several lots which had been sold by Colin Fraser to all others than to Pritchard. The lot so as aforesaid sold to J. McDonald and by him transferred to the defendants, Brown & Curry, was designated by the letter \"P,\" and the dimensions, location and boundaries thereof were laid down precisely in the same manner as the lot whereon the name 331\/2 of \" J. Brown \" was laid down on the plan prepared by the same surveyor for Mr. Pritchard in 1882, and the said street called Jasper avenue was laid down as being eighty feet wide. After rceipt of this plan by the Department of the Interior, a letter was addressed and sent by the department to Mr. Strachan informing him that the tracing of lot no. 10 in the Edmonton settlement referred to in the above letter of the 16th March, 1886, had been duly received, and that patents for the several portions of the lot were then in course of preparation in favour of the respective owners as shown on the tracing in question with the exception of that for lot \"P\" in favour of John Brown and D, S. Curry, which was stayed pending the receipt by the department of information giving Mr. D. S. Curry's Christian name in full. This information having been supplied, the said lot designated by the letter \"P\" was granted, by letters patent dated the 22nd day of April, 1887, to the defendants John Brown and Duncan Steel Curry, their heirs and assigns as tenants in common by the following description : \"All that parcel or tract of land situate, lying and being in the Edmonton Settlement in the Northwest Territories, in our Dominion of Canada, and being composed of lot lettered \"P\" as shown on a plan of the subdivision of a portion of the lot numbered 10 in the Edmonton Settlement aforesaid filed in the Department of the Interior signed by George A. Simpson, Dominion Land Surveyor, dated the 18th day of August, 1886, and registered in the registry office for the Edmonton District on the 28th day of August, 1886, the said lot numbered 10 in the Edmonton Settlement being shown on a plan of the said settlement signed by Andrew Russell for the Surveyor General of Do-minion Lands, and dated 25th May, 1883.\" Letters patent to the other petitioners granted upon and in accordance with the designation and description of their several portions as the same appeared upon the said plan, under the designation of lots lettered respectively \"A,\" \"F,\" \"P,\" \"E,\" \"S,\" \"T,\" \"V,\" and, upon the 31st day of August, 1887, letters patent were granted to Mr. Pritchard of all that portion of said river lot no. 10 coming within the following description: \"All that parcel or tract of land situate, etc., etc., in the Edmonton Settlement, etc., etc., being composed of river lot number 10, in the Edmonton Settlement aforesaid, as shewn upon a plan of the said settlement, signed by A. Russell for the Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, dated 25th May, 1883, and of record in the Department of the Interior, containing by ad-measurement eighty-one acres, more or less, saving and excepting thereout the following portions particularly described as follows : \u2014\"1st. A portion containing eight and seven-tenths acre3 abutting on the most northerly limit of said river lot number ten (particularly describing it by metes and bounds)\" ; \"2ndly. The portions or lots indicated and specified by the letters \"A,\" \"F,\" \"V,\" \"P,\" \"R,\" \"S,\" \"T,\" etc, etc, shewn on a plan of a portion of the said river lot number 10, Edmonton Settlement, of record in the Department of the Interior, signed by Geo. A. Simpson,D.L S., and duly certified to be a correct copy of a plan of part of lot numbered 10, registered in the registry office in and for the Registration District of Edmonton, in the Provisional District of Alberta, in the Northwest Territories, at two o'clock, p.m., on the 28th day of August, A.D. 1S86, and signed by George Roy, Registrar.\"\nNow the piece of land designated above by the letter \"A\" is that which on the above plan A, made by Geo. A. Simpson in 1882 for Mr. Pritchard, and of a portion of which the plan \"A,\" which is the one mentioned in the above letters patent, is a facsimile, is designated as belonging to Mr. Oliver above mentioned ; that marked letter \"F,\" is the lot which on the Pritchard plan is marked as belonging to Hogarth ; that marked \"V,\" is the lot numbered 40 on the Pritchard plan ; that marked with the letter \"P\" is the one marked in the Pritchard plan as belonging to J. Brown, (the plaintiff of that name); that marked with the letter \"R\" is that upon which the name of Sanderson is entered in the Pritchard plan ; that marked with the letter \"S \" is the lot upon which in the Pritchard plan the name of Kelly is entered, and that marked with the letter \"T\" is part of the piece upon which, in the Pritchard plan, is entered the name of Lauder, all of which persons were the petitioners in 1886 for letters patent to be granted to them. Now of these pieces of land the lot \"P,\" as above granted to the defendants, and the lots designated by the letters \"R,\" \"S,\" and \"V,\" abut for their southerly boundaries upon the northern limit of the street called Jasper avenue, as shewn on the Pritchard plan and the plan mentioned in the letters patent, in accordance with which plan the lots were granted ; and the pieces marked respectively with the letters \"A \" and \"F\" are lots the northern boundaries of which abut upon the southerly limit of the said Jasper avenue, as shewn on said plans. It is obvious therefore that the space marked upon the plan as Jasper avenue in accordance with which plan alone the lots abutting on that street are granted, was dedicated by the Crown as and for a street or public highway, to no part of which can the plaintiffs or any other persons, grantees of lots abutting upon the street, assert any claim whatever. The fact that the terms of the letters patent to Pritchard are such as to convey to him the whole of the river lot 10, except the excepted parts, can make no difference, for even though it should be held that the soil of what is designated as Jas-per avenue on the plan in accordance with which his letters patent were granted, passed to him by his said letters patent, it could only so pass as subject to the public easement of being used as a street and public highway which being situate within the Municipality of the Town of Edmonton, is subject to the jurisdiction of the said municipality by ch. 8 of the Revised Ordinances of the Territories, and having such jurisdiction, the municipality, there can be no doubt, are entitled to maintain the present suit. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe case of Fisher v. Prowse[2], relied upon by the defendants was a case very different from the present. The question there was whether a cellar flat of the defendants' house which although being in the footwalk of a public street had existed in the same condition as far back as living memory went, was unlawful, and so subjected the defendant for maintaining it to liability for injury sustained therefrom by a person using the footwalk, and it was held that it must be presumed that an erection made so far back was lawfully erected and that the dedication was made subsequently and subject to the right to maintain the erection. In the present case there is no pretence of the defendants having ever had any right as against the Crown to erect and maintain the log house which obstructs the public street in front of the lot \"P\" granted by the Crown to them, for about one-third of its width. The defendants obtained their letters patent for their lot \"P,\" having its boundaries precisely as shown in Pritchard's plan \"A,\" made in 1882, and precisely as the defendants had in 1886 petitioned that it should be granted. They obtained the only title they have to their lot according to a plan which shows the southerly limit of the piece of land granted to them to be the northerly limit of a piece in front of their lot of 80 feet in width dedicated by the Crown as and for a public street. To hold that in such case it is to be presumed that the dedication by the Crown was subject to the right of the defendants to maintain an obstruction which when erected by them was so erected without any right whatever in law, would be, in my opinion, a perversion of common sense.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants : S.S.& H.
