Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nEstate tail\u2014Mortgage of, in fee simple\u2014Statutory discharge, effect of\u2014R.S.O. ch. 111, sec. 9 and 67.\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the Court below, Henry, J. dissenting) that the execution and registration, in accordance with the Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 111, sec. 67, of a discharge of a mortgage in fee simple made by a tenant in tail reconveys the land to the mortgagor barred of the entail.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[1], on appeal to that court from the decree of Vice-Chancellor Blake, on a bill filed by the heirs general of Michael Lawlor, deceased, other than his eldest son, against his eldest son, for a declaration that the estate tail of Michael Lawlor had been barred by the execution by him as tenant in tail of a mortgage in fee simple in pursuance of the Ontario Short Forms of Mortgages Act, which mortgage had been paid off by the mortgagor, and discharged by the registration of a certificate under R.S.O. ch. 111, sec. 67.\nThe case came on by way of motion for decree before his lordship Vice-Chancellor Blake, who held that under R.S.O. ch. 100, sec. 9, the estate tail was absolutely barred by the execution of the mortgage.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the giving of the mortgage vested the fee simple in the mortgagee, and that if it had not been redeemed that estate would have remained in him, but (reversing the decision of Blake, V.C.,) that the execution and registration of the discharge above referred to operated as a valid and effectual reconveyance to the mortgagor and those claiming under him of the original estate of the mortgagor under R.S.O. ch. 111, sec. 67.\nThe pleadings are set out at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. J. Stewart Tupper for appellants:\nThere is no dispute as to the facts, and the sole point for decision is, whether the payment of the mortgage by Michael Lawlor in his life-time, upon a day later than the day provided for payment in the mortgage, and the execution by the mortgagees of a statutory certificate of discharge, and the registration of such certificate, had the effect of revesting in Michael Lawlor the lands in fee tail or in fee simple.\nThe appellants submit that Michael Lawlor died seized in fee simple of the lands, and that they descended to all his children in fee simple as tenants in common, and not to the eldest son as sole heir of his body: Re Lawlor[2]; Leith\u2019s Real Property Statutes[3]; Coote on Mortgages[4]; Hayes on Conveyancing[5]; Sugden\u2019s Real Property Statutes[6]; Trust and Loan Co. v. Fraser[7]; Ostrom v. Palmer[8].\nR.S.O. ch. 100, sec. 3, enables a tenant in tail to dispose absolutely of the lands entailed for an estate in fee simple. Section 9 provides that a mortgage in fee simple by a tenant in tail is an absolute bar in equity as well as at law against ail persons referred to in section 3 which includes the heir-at-law of the tenant in tail. Section 9 further provides that the execution of a mortgage in fee simple shall have such effect, \u201cnotwithstanding any intention to the contrary expressed or implied in the deed by which the disposition is effected.\u201d It is also provided by the same section that if the estate created by the mortgage is only an estate pur autre vie or lesser estate, then in that case it shall only be a bar so far as may be necessary to give full effect to the mortgage.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal as well as the learned Vice-Chancellor, agree in the opinion that the land was, by the execution of the mortgage, disentailed, and that the fee simple was in the mortgagees. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is based upon the fact that a statutory certificate of discharge was given by the mortgagees instead of a re\u2011conveyance of the fee simple, which the court admits would have vested it in the mortgagor.\nNow the fee simple was in the mortgagees, even after the mortgage money had been paid, and the mortgagor, Michael LawIor, had the right to call for a conveyance of the fee simple. He and his heirs general had the equity to a conveyance of all the estate that was in the mortgagees. His equity of redemption prior to payment was an equity of redemption in him and his heirs general. After the making of the mortgage, there was no right or title left in the original settlor who had created the fee tail, or his heirs, or in those whom he may have indicated in the settlement to be the remainder men, in case the issue in tail should fail. By the creation of the fee simple their interest had been absolutely barred at law and in equity. If the judgment of the Court of Appeal be right, what has become of the fee simple? It was in the mortgagees. They have not re-conveyed, it but have carved out of it a lesser estate, and given it to Michael Lawlor and the heirs of his body only. The effect of this would be that upon the failure of direct lineal issue of Michael Lawlor, the estate would revert to the mortgagees in fee simple for their own benefit. It is submited that such could not be the intention of the Act. If the statutory form of discharge fell short in law of operating as a conveyance of the fee simple, Michael Lawlor nevertheless had the right and equity to have the fee simple re\u2011conveyed, and could have declined to accept the simple discharge prescribed by the statute: McLennan v. McLean[9]. The right is not lost to his heirs general. For the purposes of this suit, it is immaterial that the attempted re-conveyance fell short of what Michael Lawlor could demand; just as in the case of no re-conveyance and no certificate of release whatever having been given, the heirs general would be entitled to call for a re-conveyance, and to maintain this suit.\nIn the case of Michael Lawlor dying before redemption, it is submitted that the heirs general would have had the right to redeem, as the estate to be redeemed was a fee simple. If they had after payment by them, taken a statutory certificate of discharge, it is submitted that the effect could not be to give to all of them an estate in fee tail; a fortiori, it could not enable the eldest son to step in and say it gave him an estate in fee tail; and yet the statute R.S.O. ch. III, sec. 67, says the registration of such discharge shall be as valid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, or any person lawfully claiming, by through or under him or them, of the original estate of the mortgagor. It is evident that a wider meaning must be given to the words, \u201cconveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor,\u201d than the interpretation put upon them by the Court of Appeal. The intention clearly was that, upon payment of the mortgage and registration of the discharge, all the estate which the mortgagor conveyed to the mortgagee should revest in the mortgagor, and that the words \u201coriginal estate\u201d will include where necessary any estate that the mortgagor has conferred upon the mortgagee; also, that they will include the estate which, in the present instance, the mortgagor had potentially and virtually in him\u2014viz., a fee simple: 36 Geo. III, c. 5; 4 Will. IV, c. 20; R.S.O.C. III, sec. 67; Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co.[10]\nIf it were not so, what would be the effect in the following case? The owner in fee gives his mortgagee a term of ninety-nine years as security for repayment of a loan. The money is paid at the end of ten years. A statutory discharge is given. It cannot be contended that this is \u201ca conveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor,\u201d for that would be the conveyance of a fee by the mortgagee who has only a term of years.\nTake the case also of one who has only a term of years, and who purports to give a mortgage in fee simple. The mortgagor subsequently acquires the fee simple, and the mortgagee thus also acquires by estoppel the fee. Upon a discharge, it is the fee simple that is conveyed to the mortgagor, and not his original estate, which was only a term of years.\nOr suppose that Michael Lawlor, after giving the mortgage, had conveyed his equity of redemption in the said lands to A.B., who then redeemed and took a statutory discharge. Could it be contended that such discharge would operate as a conveyance to A.B., not of the fee simple, but of the original estate of Michael Lawlor, which was an estate in fee tail?\nMr. McIntyre for respondent:\nThe respondent\u2019s contention on this appeal is two- fold, and the establishment of either branch of his case, irrespective of the other, is sufficient to his success.\nThe first branch is that the former half of R.S.O. sec. 9, ch. 100, does not apply to a mortgage conditioned to be void upon payment, but that such an instrument is within the exceptions enumerated in the latter half of the same section, and, therefore, is only a bar of the estate tail \u201cso far as may be necessary to give full effect to the mortgage.\u201d\nThe usual form of mortgage in England contains a proviso for a reconveyance from the mortgagee to the mortgagor upon payment[11]. Our Act (R.S.O., ch. 104, schedule B, sec. 2,) provides that upon payment, \u201cthese presents and everything in the same contained shall be absolutely null and void.\u201d\nNow, it is explained by Lord St. Leonards[12] that the object of the statute was to put an end to questions of resulting trusts, where the prescribed destination of the estate does not follow the state of the title as existing at the time of the mortgage, and while, therefore, as the lesser of two evils, it is in the general case in the first half of the section provided that the specific intention shall not be the measure of the substantial disposition (as it would be under the established rule in equity,) care is taken in the excepted cases in the latter half to remove from the operation of the statute all dispositions by way of mortgage which do not involve the question of a resulting trust. See also Hayes on Conveyancing[13]; Davidson\u2019s Prec[14].\nIt is laid down by Mr. Shelford in his work on the real property statutes[15], that where a mortgage is in tended to be an absolute bar of the entail under the statute the proviso of redemption should not be drawn so as to make the estate of the mortgagee void upon payment, but to direct that he shall re-convey it, (which is the usual form in England) to the uses intended.\nAgain the proviso of redemption in the usual form of copyhold mortgages[16], is that the mortgage shall be void upon payment. A mortgage of copyhold is effected by conditional surrender to be followed by admittance upon default of payment; and it is the opinion of the text-writers that if a legal tenant in tail of copyhold mortgage by conditional surrender which is not followed by admittance, but the money is paid off and the surrender vacated by entry of satisfaction, the estate tail remains unaffected, but that the estate tail would be barred if surrender were followed by admittance[17]. Conditional surrender and admittance are corresponding terms and transactions to mortgage under our Act and foreclosure. In other words, our form of mortgage is only a bar of the entail so far as may be necessary to give full effect to it (i.e., in the event of default and foreclosure), and is within the excepted cases enumerated in the latter half of section 9, R.S.O., ch. 100, as to which effect is denied even to an express declaration extending the operation of the charge beyond its immediate purpose, so that the covenant to pay by the mortgagor, his heirs and assigns, which may be urged contra, has no weight or significance.\nThat payment was made after the day on which it was due is no objection, inasmuch as such payment was made before foreclosure proceedings and was accepted by the mortgagee. Fisher on Mortgages[18]: \u201cWhether the money be paid or not at the proper time, it is considered sufficient in practice to enter satisfaction on the rolls.\u201d The second branch of the respondent\u2019s contention is, that the registration of the certificate of discharge operated as a re-settlement of the estate to the former uses by virtue of section 67 of the Registry Act[19], which provides that \u201csuch certificate so registered shall be as valid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage and a conveyance to the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or any person lawfully claiming, by, through or under him or them, of the original estate of the mortgagor.\nLet us assume for the purpose of argument that we are within the general case provided for by the first half of section 9, R.S.O., ch. 100. Neither the Imperial Act nor our own, although denying effect to an intention of the mortgagor expressed or implied, lays any prohibition of the estate to the former uses which may be effected by the same or another instrument (Davidson\u2019s Prec.)[20].\nOur legislature has declared that the registration of a certificate of discharge shall have that effect videlicet, a re-conveyance to the mortgagor, his heirs, etc., or any person lawfully claiming by, through, or under him or them of the original estate of the mortgager. Here is express statutory provision for the re-settlement of the estate to the former uses in the events which have happened, and the parties must be presumed to have acted with a knowledge of the law. Leith\u2019s Real and Personal Property[21]; Smith\u2019s Real and Personal Property[22].\nIt is urged by the other side against thus reading the Registry Act, as meaning what it says, that the effect of thus re-settling the estate tail by statute would be to leave the reversion in the mortgagees.\nBut so would the reversion be left in the mortgagees, in case of a re-settlement to the former uses by deed\u2014which it is indisputable may be done and is done.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nMichael Lawlor, now deceased, was tenant in fee tail in possession of a certain parcel of land in the City of Toronto.\nIn his lifetime, on the 8th February, 1867, he conveyed by indenture of mortgage to the Freehold Permanent Building Society, their successors and assigns for ever, inter alia, the said land, and by the said indenture covenanted that he had a good title in fee simple to the said land, and that he had the right to convey the same to the said society.\nOn the 6th June, 1870, the said Lawlor paid off the mortgage, and a certificate of discharge of the same was registered in the Registry Office of the city of Toronto on the same day.\nThe said Michael Lawlor died on the second day of June, A.D. 1874, leaving him surviving the following, his only children, Arthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor, Mary Emily Josephine Lawlor, Mary Louise Augustine Lawlor, and John Lawrence Lawlor.\nThe eldest son, Arthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor, made a ease to Moses Staunton, bearing date the sixteenth day of October, A.D. 1875, for twenty-one years, of the parcel of land firstly described, at the annual rent of three hundred and five dollars per annum.\nMoses Staunton died in the year 1877, after having first made his last will and testament, and appointed the said defendants, James Staunton and Sarah Staunton, his executors thereunder.\nArthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor died on the fourteenth day of September, A.D. 1880, being then in his ninth year.\nThe defendant, John Lawrence Lawlor, is the eldest brother of Arthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor, and his heir-at-law in respect of any entailed estates, and the said John Lawrence Lawlor claims to be entitled to the rents and profits under the said lease.\nThe plaintiffs are willing to confirm said lease and be parties thereto, but submit that the said lease should be reformed and corrected by the plaintiffs being with the defendant, John Lawrence Lawlor, made parties thereto, as to the said land secondly described, as lessors, and declared entitled to a proportionate part of the rent. Until the month of January, A.D. 1881, the fact of said mortgage having been given was unknown to the plaintiffs, and to the guardian of the plaintiffs, who was also the guardian of the said Arthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor; and it was also unknown to the said Moses Staunton.\nThe plaintiffs pray that it may be declared that the estate tail of said Michael Lawlor in the said secondly described lands by said mortgage became enlarged to an estate in fee simple, and that said Michael Lawlor at the time of his death was seized in fee simple of said lands, and that the plaintiffs and defendants, John Lawrence Lawlor and the deceased Arthur Ren\u00e9 Patrick Lawlor, were entitled to the same as tenants in common in fee simple.\nThat the said lease may be reformed, and the plaintiffs and defendant, John Lawrence Lawlor, be made parties thereto, as lessors and that the said lease may be amended in all necessary respects and the plaintiffs declared entitled to a proportionate part of the rent.\nThat the plaintiffs may have such further and other relief as may be requisite.\nThat the plaintiffs may be paid their costs of suit out of said property.\nMr. V.C. Blake held that the estate tail of Michael Lawlor (deceased) in the lands in question, was absolutely barred by his execution of the said mortgage in fee simple, and that his children were entitled to the same as tenants in common.\nLong previously to the year 1834, mortgages could be released or discharged on the records of the county by a certificate, the form of which was given by statute, but the effect of such certificate as affecting the title was not declared by statute, so that, notwithstanding such certificate discharging the mortgage, the estate conveyed to the mortgagee, in the absence of a reconveyance, if the condition on which the estate had been conveyed had not been fulfilled, remained in him. To obviate this difficulty and save the necessity of a reconveyance, the 4 William IV., ch. 16 (1834), was passed to deal with the estate conveyed by the mortgagors to the mortgagees and is entitled \u201cAn Act concerning the release of Mortgages,\u201d and after reciting that\nWhereas it may have happened that by reason of the non-payment of the sum of money, or of the non-performance of the condition mentioned in any mortgage at the time therein limited for payment or for performance of the same, the original estate in law may have become vested in the mortgagee, his heirs or assigns:\n(which, be it remarked, could only have been the estate actually conveyed to the mortgagee).\nAnd whereas after such estate shall so have become vested, the money secured by such mortgage, or the condition therein expressed as a defeasance of the same, may have been paid or performed respectively, and the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns, may have executed a certificate of payment or performance of the condition of such mortgage: And whereas such certificate so given does not in law so operate as a re-conveyance of the original estate of such mortgagor, or as a release or defeasance of such mortgage.\n* * *\nIt is enacted: That any certificate by any mortgagee, his heirs, administrators or assigns, heretofore given and registered under the provisions of an act passed in the thirty- fifth year of the reign of His Majesty King George III, intituled \u201cAn Act for the public registering of deeds, conveyances, wills and other incumbrances which shall be made or may affect any lands, tenements or hereditaments within the province, or which may be hereafter registered under the provisions of this Act, whether the same shall have been given or shall hereafter be given, either before or after the time limited by such mortgage for payment or performance as aforesaid, shall be and the same is hereby declared to be valid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage, and as a reconveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor therein mentioned: Provided that such certificate, if given after the expiration of the period within which the mortgagor had a right in equity to redeem, shall not have the effect of defeating any title other than a title remaining vested in the mortgagee, or his heirs, executors or administrators.\nThe registry laws were consolidated and amended by the 9th Vic., chap. 34, in which the provision, as regards such certificates, was in the very words of the 4th Wm. IV., chap. 16. In that same year the 9th Vic., chap. 2, was passed in reference to estates in tail.\nThe sections of these two acts as affecting the question now under consideration, are as follows:\n9th Vic., chap. 34, section 24:\nProvided always, and be it enacted: That any certificate of payment or performance of the condition of any mortgage by the mortgagee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns heretofore given, and registered under the provisions of the Act herein first above cited and repealed, or which having been given under the provisions of the said Act may be registered under this Act, or which may be hereafter given and registered under the provisions of this Act, whether the same shall have been given or shall hereafter be given either before or after the time limited by such mortgage for payment or performance as aforesaid, shall be and the same is hereby declared to be valid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage, and as a reconveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor therein mentioned.\n* * *\n9th Vic., chap. 2, section 3:\nAnd be it enacted: That after the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and forty\u2011six, every actual tenant in tail, whether in possession, remainder, contingency, or otherwise, shall have full power to dispose of, for an estate in fee simple absolute or for any less estate, the lands entailed as against all persons claiming the lands entailed by force of any, estate tail which shall be vested in or might be claimed by, or which but for some previous Act would have been vested in, or might have been claimed by the person making the disposition, at the time of his making the same, and also as against all persons, including the Queen\u2019s Most Excellent Majesty, Her heirs and successors, whose estates are to take effect after the determination or in defeasance of any such estate tail, saving always the right of all persons in respect of estates prior to the estate tail in respect of which such disposition shall be made, and the rights of all other persons except those against whom such disposition is by this Act authorized to be made.\nSection 9:\nProvided always, and be it enacted: That if a tenant in tail of lands shall make a disposition of the same, under this Act, by way of mortgage, or for any other limited purpose, then, and in such case, such disposion shall, to the extent of the estate thereby created, be an absolute bar in equity, as well as at law, to all persons as against whom such disposition is by this Act authorized to be made, notwithstanding an intention to the contrary may be expressed or implied in the deed by which the disposition may be effected.\nThe policy and object of these acts relating to mortgages was to enable a mortgagee on payment of the mortgage money by a simple and short process to revest in the mortgagor the estate conveyed by him to the mortgagee, that is to say to give to a registered certificate the force and effect of a conveyance, but not to give to such a certificate any other or greater operation. The policy and object of the legislature in regard to estates tail was to discourage estates tail and to get rid of such estates by a simple and easy process, and therefore power was given to a tenant in tail to bar the entail by a conveyance in fee, and, though the conveyance in fee was only by way of mortgage in fee, the statute made such a conveyance operate as a bar of the estate tail both at law and in equity. It is stated in the judg- ment of Mr. Justice Burton that the framers of the enactment relating to the effect of the discharging of a mortgage had in their mind such a case as the present and that the parties here have contracted also on that assumption. I cannot appreciate the force of this observation, as applied by the learned judge. If the parties here referred to are the mortgagor and mortgagee, it is clear from the mortgage itself that they contracted not only without reference to an estate tail, but unquestionably with reference to an estate in fee, for not only does the mortgage by express words convey a fee, but the mortgagor covenants that he has a good title in fee simple to the said lands and has a right to convey the same as he does by said mortgage. As to the assumption that the framers of the act relating to the effect of the registered certificate of discharge of a mortgage had in their mind such a case as the present, it is, I think, very plainly rebutted by the fact that when the original act was framed, there was no such Act as the 9 Vic., ch. 34, relating to estates tail, and therefore it could not have been then contemplated that the language used would have any reference to or bearing on a case like the present. But apart from the consideration of the scope and object of the act, I think it is still more strongly rebutted by the language of the act itself, because, I think, so far from the literal words of the 9 Vic., ch. 34, and the act of which it was a consolidation, supporting the view for which the learned judge was contending, the literal words of those statutes are in exact accordance with the contention of the appellants. As to the policy and object of the act, the only estate of the mortgagor which the legislature could have contemplated should pass by operation of law by virtue of a registered discharge of the mortgage and revest in the mortgagor was the estate he had conveyed to the mortgagee, because in the absence of any such act as the 9 Vic., ch. 2, relat- ing to estates in tail, the effect of any deed the mortgagor could at that time execute could only have the effect of conveying the title and estate he himself had and could give the mortgagee no other or greater estate, and no deed back from the mortgagee could give the mortgagor any other better or greater estate than he had received, and the literal words of these acts show the release was to be equivalent to a re-conveyance, which, if this word means anything, I take to be a conveyance back of what had been previously conveyed; the term re-conveyance would be unsuitable and inconsistent, if instead of the mortgagee conveying back the estate he had received, he was to convey another and different estate, or as has been suggested, that notwithstanding the literal words of the statute, the effect of his release was not to operate as a re-conveyance to the mortgagor, but was to operate as a re\u2011settling of the estate, in other words conveying back to the original settlor, living or dead, the estate in fee, and carving thereout an estate tail to the mortgagor: certainly a very large departure from the literal words of the statute. In this same statute the intention is not alone indicated by the term \u201cre-conveyance,\u201d nor in the fact that at the time of its passage the original estate of the mortgagor, capable of being re-conveyed, could only be the estate conveyed by him, but there is to be found a clear meaning given to the words \u201cthe original estate of the mortgagor,\u201d in the words which immediately follow \u201cmentioned therein,\u201d and the sentence reads thus; \u201cshall be and the same is hereby declared to be valid and effectual as a release of such mortgage and as a re-conveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor therein mentioned.\u201d As the matter being dealt with was the estate and not the personalty of the mortgagor, it seems to me the words in this sentence \u201cmentioned therein,\u201d taken in connection with the word \u201cre-conveyance,\u201d may be read as applying to the estate and not to the mortgagor.\nThis then was the position of matters up to the Revised Statutes O.c. 111 sec. 27 and Consolidated Act 31 Vic., ch. 20. Though the word \u201cconveyance\u201d is substituted for \u201cre\u2011conveyance,\u201d and the words \u201ctherein mentioned\u201d are omitted in the revised and consolidated statutes, I have searched in vain to discover one word indicating any intention on the part of the legislature to give to a registered certificate any greater or other effect than it was intended to have, and could only have had, under the original Act and the 9th Vic. But, apart from mere verbal phraseology, the statute unequivocally declares that a mortgage shall bar the estate tail both at law and in equity, and that it shall destroy the estate tail and convert it into an estate in fee, and this is to be accomplished notwithstanding any intention to the contrary, express or implied, in the deed by which the disposition is effected, clearly establishing the policy of the law as unfavorable to estates tail; and, such an estate having been got rid of by this statutory operation, it is not, I think, unreasonable, before an estate tail is held to be re-established by virtue of the statute, to ask that an intention that such should take place should be very clearly manifested. An estate in fee having been, by virtue of the mortgage, created and vested in the mortgagee, its continuance is, in my opinion, alone consistent with the policy of the law and leads to no inconsistencies or incongruities; and recreating an estate tail on the contrary, is inconsistent with such policy involving possible and probable anomalies and inconsistencies which never could have been intended by the legislature.\nIf the words \u201coriginal estate\u201d refer to the tenancy in tail of the mortgagor, it is not difficult to suggest circumstances of by no means improbable occurrence which would lead to complications and anomalies of an inconsistent and unreasonable character.\nIf the effect is simply to vest in the mortgagor an estate in tail, should the issue in tail fail, to whom is the estate to go? Is it to revest in the mortgagor or his heirs, or to go to the original owner in fee or his heir? If the former, surely such a state of things could never have been intended; if the latter, to accomplish this you must depart from the literal language and construe it so as to make the registered certificate amount, not to a conveyance to the mortgagor of his original estate, but to a conveyance to the settlor, whose tenant in tail the mortgagor was, if living, or his heirs, if dead, of his original estate, while, by virtue of the statute and the mortgage, all his estate, both at law and equity, has been taken from him, so that, if the literal words of the statute are to prevail, no words are to be found clothing the settlor with his original estate, or with his original estate with a tenancy in tail carved out of it? Or, in case of the death of the mortgagor, is the eldest son alone entitled to redeem? Or, if the mortgagee elects to re-convey, to whom is the reconveyance to be made, and what is the estate he is to reconvey, and to whom? Or, again should the mortgagor die and the mortgage money is paid out of his personal estate, which would be the fund primarily liable, are the shares of all the children in the personal estate to contribute to such payment, and the eldest son take the whole mortgaged premises released from the mortgage debt? Or, is their money to be taken and they compelled to look to him for reimbursement? Or, in view of the contingencies so pertinently suggested by Mr. Tupper in his very clear and very able argument, what would be the effect in the following case:\u2014The owner in fee gives his mortgagee a term of ninety-nine years as security for repayment of a loan. The money is paid at the end of ten years, A statutory discharge is given. Can it be contended that this is \u201cconveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor,\u201d for that would be the conveyance of a fee by the mortgagee who has only a term of years.\nTake the case also of one who has only a term of years, and who purports to give a mortgage in fee simple. The mortgagor subsequently acquires the fee simple, and the mortgagee thus also acquires by estoppel the fee. Upon a discharge, it is the fee simple that is conveyed to the mortgagor, and not his original estate, which was only a term of years.\nSuppose that Michael Lawlor, after giving the mortgage, had conveyed his equity of redemption in the said lands to A.B., who then redeemed and took a statutory discharge. Could it be contended that such discharge would operate as a conveyance to A.B., not of the fee simple, but of the original estate of Michael Lawlor, which was an estate in fee tail.\nBut assuming the words used have the literal meaning attributed to them in the court below, and are to be read and construed without reference to the previous statutes in pari materi\u00e2, which I think ought not to be, I cannot think that as opposed to the policy and object of the Act, they are so inflexible that they cannot be read as conveying the intention of the Legislature, that the release was to operate as a conveyance to the mortgagor of all the estate the mortgagor at the time of the making of the mortgage had the power and ability of conveying; and which he by the mortgage did actually convey to the mortgagee. I cannot think this is a forced or; constrained construction. It is a well established principle that in construing acts of Parliament the literal signification of the words is not to be adhered to, if such a construction would involve a manifest inconsistency or absurdity.\nAnd in the Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co.[23] it was said by Lord Selborne, L.C.:\nThe more literal construction ought not to prevail, if it is opposed to the intention of the Legislature, as apparent by the statute, and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction by which that intention will be better effectuated.\n* * *\nAnd by Lord Blackburn:\nThe matter turns upon the construction of an Act of Parliament which is an instrument in writing. I believe there is no dispute at all that in construing an instrument in writing, we are to consider what the facts were in respect to which it was framed, and the object as appearing from the instrument, and taking all those together, we are to see what is the intention appearing from the language, when used with reference to such facts, and with such an object.\nIn Ex parte Walton; re Levy[24], Jessel, M.R. says:\u2014\nThis case raises a very important question as to the proper construction to be put upon the 23rd section of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869. Before considering the exact words of the section in question, I should like to say a word or two as to the rule which is binding; on all courts when they are concerned to construe statutes or other instruments. Whatever may have been the rule in times past as to the interpretation of statutes, the rules which are to be applied are now well recognized. In order to show what those rules are, I am about to cite some passages from the last case on the subject, that of the Caledonian Railway Company v. The North British Railway Company23, decided by the House of Lords on the 17th of February last. That is not only the last decision as to the construction of statutes, but it is a very recent decision. It was an appeal from the Court of Sessions in Scotland, but it is an authority binding on this court inasmuch as the law on the subject is the same both in England and Scotland. The appellants there said that the literal effect should be given to the words of the statute, although by such a construction effect would Act be given to the preamble of the statute. But in his judgment the Lord Chancellor, Lord Selborne, said: \u201cThe more literal construc- tion ought not to prevail if (as the court below has thought) it is opposed to the intention of the legislature as apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some construction by which that intention will be better effectuated.\u201d And Lord Blackburn cited with approval the opinion of Lord Wensleydale which he called the golden rule for construing all written engagements, and which in the case of Grey v. Pearson[25], he stated thus: \u201cThat in construing wills, and indeed statutes, and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but no further.\u201d\nBelieving, therefore, that the construction of this act contended for by appellant is in accordance with the intention of the legislature as expressed in the original enactments, and with the policy of the law, and leads to no inconveniences or inconsistencies whatever, while the opposite construction would in a great variety of cases be anomalous and inconsistent, and is not warranted by the literal language of the act, I think the appellants contention should prevail.\nI am of opinion that the legislature intended that the release should be equivalent to and have the same effect as a conveyance by deed, that it was not intended that the mortgagor should receive back from the mortgagee an inferior or lesser estate than he had conveyed to him; in other words, that the legislature intended that the release should, by operation of law, take out of the mortgagee all the estate vested in him, and vest the same in the mortgagor, thus giving back to the mortgagor just what the mortgagee received from him\u2014no more nor less.\nWhen the case was first opened I must say I was impressed with the observations of the court below upon the wording of the Act, but, on a critical and further consideration of the case and the consideration of Mr. Tupper\u2019s clear and, I now think, conclusive argument, all doubts have been removed from my mind.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis is a suit instituted in the Court of Chancery of Ontario by the appellants, who are the heirs general of Michael Lawlor, deceased, other than the respondent, against is eldest surviving son, the present respondent, as heir in tail of his father, praying a declaration by the court that the estate tail of Michael Lawlor in the lands in question had been barred and converted into a fee simple by the execution by Michael Lawlor, when tenant in tail in possession, of a mortgage in fee simple, and that his children were therefore entitled as heirs general to the same as tenants in common in fee simple.\nThere was no dispute as to the facts, and the only point for decision is whether the payment of the mortgage debt by Michael Lawlor in his lifetime upon a day later than the day of payment appointed in the mortgage deed, and the execution by the mortgagees of a statutory certificate of discharge and the registration of such certificate under the provisions of the Registry Act, had the effect of revesting in the mortgagor the legal estate in fee simple or in fee tail.\nThe appellants contend that Michael Lawlor died seised in fee simple of the lands in question, and that they consequently descended to all his children as tenants in common in fee simple. The respondent on the other hand insists that, although the effect of the mortgage by Michael Lawlor, a tenant in tail in possession, was to vest an estate in fee simple in the mortgagees, yet that by force of the Registry Act, declaring the effect to be given to the registration of the discharge of a mortgage, the fee simple which had been acquired by the mortgagees did not pass to the mort- gagor, but the original estate tail which he had up to the date of the execution of the mortgage was revived and revested in him. The cause was originally heard before Vice Chancellor Proudfoot, who made a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill. This decree was afterwards reversed by the Court of Appeals, from whose decision the present appeal has been brought.\nBy the act respecting the Assurance of Estates Tail, Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 100, sec. 9, which is a transcript of the 21st section of the English Act for the abolition of Fines and Recoveries, 8 & 4 W. IV., ch.74, it is enacted that:\nIf a tenant in tail of lands makes a disposition of the same under this act by way of mortgage or for any other limited purpose, then such disposition shall, to the extent of the estate thereby created, be an absolute bar in equity as well as at law to all persons as against whom such disposition is by this act authorized to be made notwithstanding any intention to the contrary expressed or implied in the deed by which the disposition is effected.\nThe effect of this provision was, therefore, to make the mortgage in fee executed by Michael Lawlor an absolute bar to his heir in tail, in other words, to convert his estate tail into a fee simple as effectually as if he had executed a disentailing assurance under the statute by granting the estate to a grantee in fee limiting the use to himself in fee simple. The mortgagees, therefore, took a legal estate in fee simple, and Michael Lawlor could, upon payment, have insisted upon a re-conveyance to himself in fee, and if the mortgagees had refused so to re-convey, they could have been compelled to do so by the decree of a Court of Equity in a suit instituted for that purpose. The re-conveyance was, however, not carried out by a formal deed, but by means of a discharge of the mortgage in the form prescribed by the 67th section of the Registry Act, (Rev. Stat. Ont. ch. 111,) which enacts that the registration of a certificate by the mortgagee of the due payment of the mortgage money shall be as \u201cValid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage and as a conveyance to the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or any person lawfully claiming by, through, or under him, or them, of the original estate of the mortgagor.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeals determined that by the operation of this provision in the present case the effect of registering the certificate was to revive in Michael Lawlor the estate tail, which by force of the section of the act relating to estates, tail already quoted had been absolutely barred by the execution of the mortgage in fee. This decision is based entirely upon the construction given to the words in the clause of the Registry Act before quoted: \u201cthe original estate of the mortgagor.\u201d I am unable to concur in this conclusion, for I am of opinion, that the effect of the registered certificate must be to vest in the mortgagor the entire legal estate held by the mortgagee, and of which, after payment, he was a mere trustee for the mortgagor.\nThe sole object of the provision in the Registry Act was manifestly to afford a cheap and simple method of enabling mortgagors to obtain a re-conveyance; it was originally enacted long before the statute relating to the abolition of estates tail, having been first contained in a statute of Upper Canada containing this provision relating to the discharge of mortgages alone, which was passed in 1834, and it has been embodied in its original terms in the subsequent Registry Acts and in the three successive revisions pf the statute law of Upper Canada and Ontario which have since been made. I think we are called upon to construe the words \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cconveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor,\u201d as meaning that the whole estate which originally passed to the mortgagee, and of which the equity of redemption remains in the mortgagor, should be deemed to pass by the effect of the registration. To give the words the strict verbal construction ascribed to them by the court below, would be to prevent the manifest intention of the framers of the Act, which could have been no other than that I have mentioned, to substitute for a formal reconveyance a less expensive and more expeditious mode of revesting the estate in the mortgagor. Could it be pretended that in case a tenant for life, having also a power to appoint the fee simple, should have made a mortgage by executing the power and appointing the fee simple to the mortgagee, also conveying his life estate for the same purpose by the same instrument and limiting the equity of redemption to himself in fee, thus not merely executing the power for the purpose of the mortgage but absolutely, were to take a statutory discharge and register it, that would have the effect of revesting in the mortgagor, not merely the life estate, but also of restoring the power which would be exhausted and gone. This, however, would be the effect of the strict construction given to the words \u201coriginal estate of the mortgagor,\u201d by the Court of Appeals, for the operation of a conveyance by a tenant in tail in possession in passing a fee under the statute is strictly the execution of a statutory power, and the analogy between it and a conventional power in the case which I put is for all present purposes perfect.\nFurther, the words of the section of the Registry Act prescribing the effect of the discharge have not, as it appears to me, been sufficiently considered; the discharge is to be valid and effectual as \u201ca release of such mortgage.\u201d I do not construe the release here meant as a mere release of the debt, for a release of a debt already paid and declared to be paid and satisfied by the certificate would be useless. I consider this expression as having refer- ence to the legal estate held by the mortgagee, and I read it as being used in the same sense as the term \u201crelease\u201d is applied to a conveyance of the legal estate by a trustee to his cestui que trust\u2014not used, it is true, as the strict technical definition of the legal conveyance adopted to pass the estate, but including in a generic sense any conveyance by which the estate of the trustee is re-conveyed to the cestui que trust. I think, therefore, that by force of the words \u201crelease of such mortgage,\u201d the statute clearly enough expresses that the whole estate held as a trustee by the satisfied mortgagee shall pass to his cestui que trust, the mortgagor, in as large an estate as that which the latter has in the equity of redemption vested in him at the time the certificate is registered. Any other construction than this, it appears to me, would be in direct contravention of the policy of the act relating to estates tail, which, by the strong provision of the clause in question, enacting that the conveyance of a fee simple for a limited purpose merely shall constitute an absolute bar, an effect which no expression by the parties of a contrary intention shall control, is shown to be the principle that an estate tail once discharged or enlarged into a fee simple for any purpose is not to be kept alive or revived.\nIf the words of this provision for the registry of the discharge were so strong as to admit of no other construction than that adopted by the Court of Appeals, I should consider that that enactment, originally passed long before the statute relating to the assurances of estates tail, had no application to the case of a mortgage of such an estate vesting the fee simple in the mortgagee. For the reasons, however, which I have before stated, I am of opinion that this statutory mode of re-conveyance is applicable alike to a case such as the present, as well as to the case of a mortgage in fee created by a tenant for life having power to appoint the fee, and that in both cases the effect of registering the certificate is to clothe the equitable estate vested in the mortgagor with the legal estate of the mortgagee, although that legal estate may not be the same estate as that held by the mortgagor prior to the execution of the mortgage, but only the estate originally acquired by the mortgagee under the operation of the mortgage.\nI think the Vice Chancellor took a correct view of the construction to be placed upon the clause in question, and that his decree ought to be restored by reversing the order of the Court of Appeals, which must of course be with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurrred with Ritchie, C.J.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe tenant in tail of the land in question in this suit made a conveyance by way of mortgage, and thereby under the provisions of section 9 of chapter 100 of the revised statutes of Ontario, converted the estate into one of fee simple, which was held during the currency of the mortgage by the mortgagee. The mortgage was paid off by the tenant in tail and a certificate of discharge as provided by the Registry Act was obtained and duly registered, as provided by sec. 68 of ch. 111 of the revised statutes.\nThe question then is, what estate had the mortgagor after the mortgage was so discharged? Upon the settlement of that question the rights of the parties in this suit depend.\nThere is no doubt but the mortgagees held for the time an estate in fee simple and the rights of all parties were barred for the time.\nThe mortgage not having been paid off when due I consider of no consequence. The mortgagees received payment, and it matters little at what time provided it was done in the lifetime of the mortgagor. They gave a certificate which put an end to any title they at any time had. Section 6 of ch. 99 of the revised statutes provides that a certificate of payment or discharge of a mortgage \u201cat whatsoever time given, and whether before or after the time limited by the mortgage for payment or performance, shall, if in conformity with the Registry Act, be valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\u201d\nThere was no re-conveyance from the mortgagees, and therefore I think it unnecessary to consider what the effect of such might be. One statute enabled the tenant in tail to convey in fee by a mortgage, and another statute\u2014passed twenty-two years afterwards\u2014provides for the release and discharge of the mortgage, thereby determining the title and estate of the mortgagees whatever it was. The 68th sec. of ch. 100 of the revised statutes (enacted 31 Vic., ch. 20, sec. 60), provides that the \u201ccertificate so registered shall be as valid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage and as a conveyance to the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or of any person lawfully claiming by, through or under him or them, of the original estate of the mortgagor.\u201d\nBy the provision of the statute the tenant in tail is enabled to mortgage in fee and thereby convey a higher title than he held, but in the absence of a conveyance back to him of the higher estate he could not claim to have such, particularly when the statute provides otherwise. The mere payment of the mortgage has not the qualities of a conveyance, and the section of the Registry Act expressly provides that the only effect of the certificate is to give him the original estate he held. To decide otherwise would be to turn his life estate into one of fee simple to the manifest injury of those in remainder, and to defeat the object of the creator of the estate. It is true that in a plain case we could not be influenced by those considerations, but in one in which there is doubt they should not be ignored. Were there the provision in the mortgage for a reconveyance, the mortgagor, having conveyed an estate in fee simple, might, on payment of the mortgage, have insisted upon a reconveyance of the same estate, but under the mortgage in this case all that could be asked for was a release or discharge. Such was given, but by operation of the statute it only remitted the title the party originally held, and nothing more nor less.\nThere is no doubt that the mortgage unredeemed would have barred all parties, but I cannot arrive at the conclusion that the Legislature intended the provision to apply to a case where the mortgage is redeemed and discharged, nor can I see upon principle how any one can become entitled to an interest in real estate without a conveyance.\nIf the tenant in this case obtained the title in fee simple, whom did he get it from? Certainly not from the mortgagees, for they made no conveyance to him, and no one else gave it to him. If he did not hold it the appellants cannot recover, and it is not necessary to decide by whom else it is held.\nI am of opinion there was not an estate in fee in the mortgagor at the time of his death, and therefore I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment of the Court of Chancery be restored. Any other judgment would, in my opinion, constitute a repeal of the Disentailing Estate Act. The costs of all parties in appeal should be ordered to come out of the estate.\nAppeal allowed with costs out of the estate.\nSolicitors for appellants: Foy & Tupper.\nSolicitors for respondent: McCarthy, Hoskin, Plumb & Creelman.\n[1] 6 Ont.

(respondents) partners in trade, sued the D. T. Co. (appellants) for defamation of the respondents in their trade. In the declaration it was alleged:\u20141. That they were wholesale and retail merchants at Halifax. That appellants wrongfully, falsely and maliciously, by means of their telegraph lines, transmitted, sent and published from their office at Halifax to their office in St. John, and there caused to be printed, copied, circulated and published the false and defamatory message following:\u2014\"John Silver & Co., wholesale clothiers, of Greenville street, have failed; liabilities heavy.\" 2nd. That same message was caused also to be published in other parts of the Dominion. 3rd. That the appellants promised and agreed with the proprietor or publisher of the St. John Daily Telegraph newspaper, and entered into an arrangement with him, whereby the appellants agreed to collect and transmit, by means of their telegraph lines, news despatches to said newspaper from time to time, and that such publisher should pay for all such messages and should publish them in his newspaper, and that in pursuance of said agreement the appellants wrongfully, maliciously and by means of said telegraph, transmitted, sent and published from their office in Halifax to their office in St. John, and there falsely and maliciously caused to be written, printed, copied, circulated and published the above message, whereby many customers who had heretofore dealt with plaintiffs ceased to do so, and their credit and business, standing and reputation were thereby greatly damaged. The D. T. Co. denied the several publications charged, and also the entering into the agreement mentioned in the third count and the forwarding of the messages as alleged. At the trial it was proved that the telegram which was published in the morning paper was corrected in the evening edition, and that the publisher's agreement was with one Snyder, an officer of the company, to furnish him news at so much for every hundred words, but that he only paid for such as he used. The original despatch was not produced. The only evidence as to damage was the evidence of two witnesses, who proved that by reason of the publication they ceased to do business with the respondents as they had previously been accustomed to do. This evidence was objected to as inadmissible, but was received. The dealings of these witnesses with the plaintiffs consisted in selling their exchange and sometimes discounting their notes. The counsel for the defendants moved for a non-suit which was refused and the case was submitted to the jury who, upon the evidence, rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs with $7,000 damages. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was\nHeld,\u20141. (Taschereau, and Gwynne JJ., dissenting,) That the appellants, the D. T. Co., were responsible for the publication of the libel in question.\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting: assuming the agreement in question to be one within the scope of the purposes for which the defendants were incorporated, and that Snyder had sufficient authority to enter into it on behalf of the defendant company, the evidence established that the defendants collected, compiled and transmitted the news for the proprietor of the newspaper, as his confidential agents and at his request, and that they were not responsible for the publication by the said proprietor and publisher of said news, for which the damages were awarded.\n2. (Sir W. Ritchie, C.J., doubting, and Henry, J., dissenting) that the damages were excessive, and therefore a new trial ought to be granted.\nHeld also per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ. No special damages having been alleged in the declaration, the evidence as to such damages, having been objected to, was inadmissible, and therefore a new trial should be granted.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1].\nThis action was brought by the plaintiffs as partners in trade against the defendant company for defamation of the plaintiffs in the way of their trade.\nThe first count of the declaration, consisting of three counts, alleges that the plaintiffs before and at the time of the committing the grievance hereinafter alleged, were merchants carrying on business by wholesale and retail at Halifax, under the name of John Silver & Co., and the defendants were at the said time proprietors of, and by their servants and agents managed' and conducted a certain system of electric telegraph upon, along and over certain lines of, and owned by, the defendants; and the plaintiffs say that whilst the plaintiffs were such merchants and carrying on business as aforesaid, the defendants, wrongfully, falsely and maliciously, by means of the said telegraph so owned and used by them, transmitted, sent and published from the office of the said defendants in the said city of Halifax to their office in the city of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, and there falsely and maliciously caused to be written, printed, copied, circulated and published, the false, malicious and defamatory message following of and concerning the plaintiffs, that is to say: \"John Silver & Company\" (meaning the plaintiffs), \"wholesale clothiers of Granville street, have failed, liabilities heavy,\" meaning thereby that the plaintiffs had failed and become bankrupt and unable to pay their debts in full, and were unable to continue their business, whereby and by reason and means whereof the plaintiffs' credit was impaired, and their business and reputation seriously injured.\nThe second count alleged\u2014that the defendants on or about the 6th day of January, 1879, by means of said telegraphic lines owned and used by them, and by means of the facilities possessed by them for the transmission of intelligence by telegraph, wrongfully, falsely and maliciously transmitted, sent and published from their office in the city of Halifax to their office in the city of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick and to their office in the city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, and to other cities in the Dominion of Canada and in the United States of America, and there falsely and maliciously caused to be written, printed, copied, circulated and published in divers ways, amongst others, by copying, publishing, or causing to be copied and published, in the St. John Daily Telegraph newspaper and other newspapers and circulating sheets in said city of St. John and elsewhere, the false, malicious and defamatory message following of and concerning the plaintiffs; that is to say\u2014(as in first count,) whereby, and by reason and means whereof, the plaintiff's credit was impaired, and their business and reputation seriously injured, and they otherwise suffered great loss and damage by reason of the premises.\nThe third count was as follows:\u2014And also for that the plaintiffs were both before and at the time of the committing of the grievances hereinafter alleged, dry goods merchants, carrying on business in Halifax, under the name and style of John Silver & Co., and the defendants were, when, &c., the proprietors of, and by their servants and agents managed and conducted a certain system or line of electric telegraph upon and along certain lines of telegraph owned or used by them, and upon and along and over certain other lines of telegraph connecting with the defendants said lines for the purpose of enabling defendants to transmit messages from place to place in the Dominion of Canada and in the United States of America, and plaintiffs say, that the defendants promised and agreed to and with the proprietor or publisher of the St. John Daily Telegraph newspaper, and entered into an arrangement with such proprietor or publisher, whereby the defendants agreed to collect and to transmit by means of their said line or system of electric telegraph, news despatches to the said newspaper from time to time, and it was also further agreed, arranged or understood by and between the said parties last named, that the said proprietor or publisher would pay the defendants for all such messages as said defendants would transmit to them, and such proprietor or publisher should publish in said newspaper; and plaintiffs say that in pursuance of said arrangement and agreement the defendants wrongfully, maliciously, and by means of the said telegraph so owned and used by them transmitted, sent and published from the defendants' office in Halifax to their office in St. John, and there falsely and maliciously caused to be written, printed, copied, circulated and published, the false, malicious and defamatory message following, of and concerning the plaintiffs, that is to say, - (as in first count), whereby and by reason and means whereof, many customers who had theretofore dealt with plaintiffs ceased to do so, and plaintiffs credit and business standing and reputation were thereby greatly damaged.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded, denying the several publications charged in the respective counts, and denying the entering into the agreement mentioned in the third and the forwarding the message therein stated in pursuance of any such agreement.\nIssues being joined on these pleas, the case went over for trial before a jury. At the trial, the depositions of the proprietor and publisher of the St. John Daily Telegraph Mr. Elder taken upon an examination de bene esse before a commissioner were read, subject to objections taken at the examination to the admissibility of the evidence and its sufficiency. The substance of his evidence was\u2014that he had never seen any telegram containing the matter complained of as libellous; that telegrams are received by officials at the office of the paper and are not generally seen by him, and are destroyed the morning after their receipt; that his attention was first drawn to the telegram in question by a telegram received from the Dominion Telegraph Co., saying that \"the prior telegram was not correct,\" whereupon he wrote an article which was published in his paper. By the copy of depositions printed in the case it appears, however, that he produced at his examination a copy of the St. John Daily Telegraph of the 7th January, 1879, from which an extract was taken and annexed to the depositions and marked Exhibit B, which is as follows:\u2014\nThe Daily Telegraph,\nSt. John, N.B., Tuesday, January 7, 1879.\nHalifax, January 6.\nJohn Silver & Co., wholesale clothiers of Granville street, failed to-day; liabilities heavy.\nHoward C. Evans & Co., commission merchants and lobster packers, failed; liabilities about $20,000.\nJohn S. McLean & Co., of this city, are large creditors of Carvill Brothers, Charlottetown, P.E.I., who failed on Saturday, with liabilities of $100,000.\nThe steamer Carroll arrived from Boston and the Cortes from Newfoundland this morning.\nThat telegram was corrected he said in the evening edition of his paper of the same day, for he got the telegram saying that the prior telegram was incorrect on the same day in time for the evening edition: whereupon he had a conversation with Mr. Snyder, a person in the employ of the defendant's at St. John, and who, as witness said, appeared to be at the head of defendant's office there. Witness complained to him of the telegram which witness had to correct, whereupon Mr. Snyder expressed his regret that it had occurred. Witness's complaint was that the telegram he had received from Snyder was not correct, and that it was a serious matter for witness that it should not be correct. His reply was that they were very sorry for it, and would caution the party who had transmitted it to be more careful in future, or words to that effect. Snyder, as witness said, informed him that he had received the news in the telegram from the party in Halifax who compiled the news for him. Witness also said that he took a good deal of news from the defendant company from the Upper Provinces and from the Maritime Provinces including Halifax. The terms upon which he received these telegrams were arranged with Mr. Snyder, and were so much for every hundred words, but that he only paid for such as he used, unless they came from a special correspondent of his own. That he had at the time a friend in Halifax who was authorized to send him news, but that the telegram in question was not from him. He also said that he was in the habit of paying Snyder for tolls for the compiling and transmission of news by telegram on bills presented to witness in the name of the company, and he added that his transactions were entirely with Snyder, and that he did not think that in them the name of the company was used at all, but witness took it that Snyder was agent and manager of the defendants' company from seeing him in the office and paying him the tolls for the telegrams on the bills of the company. A reporter, Mr. Thompson, employed in the office of the Daily Telegraph newspaper, was also called, who testified to the news under the head of \"Halifax,\" in exhibit B, published in the Daily Telegraph having been taken from a telegraphic despatch delivered to him at the Daily Telegraph office by a boy who he understood to be a messenger of the defendants, and he also said that this despatch so received by him was not now forthcoming because telegrams after they were used were either thrown into the waste paper basket or on the floor. That after proof reading they are not preserved.\nThe evidence offered as to damage was the evidence of one George McKeen, partner in a firm of Carvell, McKeen & Co., St. John, and an agent of theirs named Mathers residing at Halifax, who were called for the purpose of showing that by reason of the publication complained of Mr. McKeen's firm ceased to do business with the plaintiffs as they had previously been accustomed to do. This evidence was objected to as inadmissible, but was nevertheless received, and was in substance as follows:\nMr. McKeen stated that his firm, through Mr. Mathers as their agent, had done business in Halifax for many years. That he, Mr. McKeen, took the St. John Daily Telegraph, and that in it he saw a telegraphic report of the plaintiffs failure, but he could not state the date; that in consequence of seeing that report, he communicated with Mr. Mathers, his agent at Halifax, once in writing and once verbally; that the verbal communication was to the effect that the publication of the telegram would affect the credit of the plaintiffs, and that he did not wish to have any further dealings with them; that his dealings consisted in selling them exchange, for which he had been in the habit of receiving plaintiffs promissory notes, and sometimes he discounted their notes; but after that he had no dealings with them; that it was in February or the latter end of January that he had the conversation with Mathers.\nMathers evidence was to the effect that the plaintiffs of their own accord, without any solicitation, were in the habit of purchasing exchange from him as agent of Carvell, McKeen & Co.; that his principals wrote to him, as he thinks, upon the 9th January, asking \"what about Silver?\" to which he says he replied, after making enquiries himself, that he thinks the saw Hedley about it; who Hedley is did not appear, nor does the witness say what the result of his inquiries was or what he replied to the inquiry made of him by by his principals. The second communication which he had with his principals upon the subject, that is to say, the verbal one, was a week or ten days afterwards, and, he says, he received instructions from his principals, in the verbal communication not to deal with the plaintiffs. The witness never had any dealings with the plaintiffs in the way of their trade as dealers in dry goods, nor otherwise than as selling them exchange as above stated when they applied for it, and, he adds, that the firm had since failed.\nThe learned counsel for the defendants moved for a non-suit, which was refused, and the case was submitted to the jury who, upon the above evidence, rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs with $7,000 damages.\nIn the following term a rule nisi was obtained to shew cause why this verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted upon the following grounds:\n1. Because said verdict is against law and evidence.\n2. For the improper reception of evidence.\n3. Because the damages found by the jury are excessive.\nUpon argument, this rule was discharged, Weatherbe, J., dissenting, and it is against the rule discharging this rule nisi that this appeal was taken.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy and Mr. Rigby, Q. C., for appellants:\nThe action is for libel, in a press despatch sent by the Company from Halifax to St. John, and the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiffs with $7000 damages. The action was brought by two partners, and could only be brought by them as co-partners and with respect to damages resulting to them as co-partners, and the verdict must be limited to such damage.\nThe publication, inuendo and damage alleged in the declaration are denied by the pleas, and also the alleged agreement with the St. John Daily Telegraph, and the transmission and publication in pursuance thereof of the alleged libel. In the first place, if there was publication by the company, it was at a much earlier period than when it reached St. John, and plaintiffs have given no evidence of publication in Halifax. If, however, they contend that we were guilty because the alleged libel was published in St. John, we say the only evidence on which they can rely is the newspaper containing the alleged libel. Now, that is not sufficient evidence of publication of the libel by defendants.\nThe original message sent from Halifax to St. John was not produced, and no sufficient basis laid for secondary evidence of it.\nElder never saw it and never looked for it. The original document which should have been produced or accounted for was the manuscript in the defendants' office in Halifax from which the message was sent over the wires to St. John, and no evidence of any kind of or concerning it was given by the plaintiffs.\nThere was no evidence that the words published in the newspaper were the same as the despatch sent over the defendants' line, even if the newspaper was admissible in evidence.\nMoreover the copy of the newspaper produced by Elder was not admissible as evidence against the defendants, and was no proof of publication by them of the alleged libel. It might have been evidence against Elder himself, but not against the defendants.\nThe court below sought to connect this evidence with Snyder's statements or admissions, but they could not be admissible against the defendants.\nThere was no evidence that Snyder had any authority from or agency for defendants for the publication of the alleged libel, or the delivery of the message to the newspaper, and his general agency as manager of the defendants' business in St. John would not extend to such acts, which are not within the scope or functions of a telegraph company. Harding v. Greening[2]; Parkes v. Prescott[3].\nThere was no evidence either that the company ever recognised or ratified what Snyder did, and without evidence of this kind there can be no liability attached to defendants.\nThen, again, the collection of news paragraphs and their transmission from place to place by telegraph, and the selling of them to the newspapers, is not within the business or corporate powers of the defendants, and it would also appear from the evidence of Elder that this business was done by Snyder personally, in connection with some person in Halifax, and that the wires of the defendants were only used by these persons for conveying such messages. Cooley on Torts[4]; Poulton v. The L. & S. W. Ry. Co.[5]; Edwards v. The L. & N. W. Ry. Co.[6]; Erb v. Gt. W. Ry. Co.[7].\nWe also contend that the parties in the suit are not identified with the parties mentioned in the alleged libel.\u2014\nOur next point is that the damages are grossly excessive, and there was no evidence of any damage whatever having been sustained by the plaintiffs from the alleged publication by the defendants of the libel, nor in fact of any damage whatever to the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs gave no evidence themselves, or by any witness, of the nature and extent of their business, of their solvency or position at the time the alleged libel was published, or that their subsequent failure was in any way attributable to the alleged libel. The contradiction of the statement of the firm referred to in the alleged libel appeared in the evening edition of the paper on the same day, and again in the next morning's edition, and no damage was shown to have resulted, or could have resulted. There was no malice shown or suggested. In the absence of any evidence of any substantial damage on which the jury could rationally found such a large verdict, it is evident that they must have acted on some prejudice, or from some motive or opinion not justified by the evidence, which is a sufficient reason for granting a new trial for excessive damages. Folkard on slander and libel[8]; Smith v. Frampton[9]; Kelly v. Sherlock[10].\nMr. Thompson, Q. C., for respondents:\u2014\nThe point that plaintiffs were not identified was not taken at the trial. If raised at the trial such objection would have been instantly disposed of by evidence available to the plaintiffs at the time. Robertson v. Dumaresq[11]; Burgess v. Boetfeur[12]; Donnelly v. Bawden[13].\nIt has been argued that there is no evidence of special damage. My answer is that by the pleadings it was admitted that plaintiffs were doing business, and the jury had the right to find that the libel complained of referred to plaintiffs. See Nova Scotia Rev. Stats. 4 series, ch. 94, sec 152 and 144. Marsden v. Henderson[14]; Hamber v. Roberts[15].\nAs to the reception of the telegram contained in the newspaper in proof, the appellees contend that it was out of their power to give better evidence as to the loss of the original. Its loss was sufficiently accounted for to let in the evidence offered, and such evidence was properly received, R. v. Johnson[16]; Kensington v. Inglis[17]; Roscoe's Nisi Prius[18]; Stowe v. Querner[19].\nSnyder's admission was sufficient, and his agency was clearly proved.\nThe evidence of Elder and Thompson established, to say the least, that the loss or destruction of the telegram was probable, and therefore very slight evidence was required. See Freeman v. Arkell[20].\nThe evidence given satisfied both judge and jury that the telegram was lost or destroyed, and there being no degrees in secondary evidence, the newspaper was therefore admissible. If no such message was sent, or if it never existed, the onus lay on defendants of interposing before the newspaper was offered and giving evidence to establish that there never was such a messsage and none such was sent.\nI will now take up the question of ultra vires.\nIt was open to appellants to prove what Snyder's duties and powers were, and in the absence of such proof on their part, it must be assumed he was their agent, especially as the evidence shows that Snyder was in charge of defendants' office, transacted their business and received the tolls on telegraphic messages. The act in question, viz., transmitting and delivering for publication the message in question, was a matter within the duty of Snyder and defendants' operators, and it must therefore be assumed that the transmission, copying and delivery to the Telegraph newspaper was the act of defendants. Assuming, however, that Snyder was not defendants' agent and the message was procured, sent and delivered at his instance, yet inasmuch as defendants' wires and servants, within the scope of their duties, were used in transmitting, copying and circulating the libel, they are liable, especially as they received pay for what they did. A corporation is liable for a tort even when ultra vires. Brice on Ultra vires[21]; Tench v. The G. W. Ry. Co.[22]; Angell and Ames on Corporations.[23].\nThe amount of damages was a question purely for the jury, and the direction of the judge is not complained of. Nor was it contended that the verdict was perverse. Riding v. Smith[24]; Kelly v. Sherlock[25]; Blanchard v. The Windsor and Annapolis Ry.[26].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis was an action for an alleged libel. The declaration contained three counts. [The learned Chief Justice then stated the pleadings.]\nI think the evidence in this case fully justified the jury in finding all the issues raised by the pleadings in this cause in favor of the plaintiffs, the evidence satisfactorily establishing\u20141st. That defendants were owners and proprietors of certain telegraphic lines, and by their servants and agents transmitted over such lines, as a part of their business, for pay and reward, telegraphic news to be published in the public newspapers, the proprietors of which may have agreed to receive and pay for such news; and as to the paper Daily Telegraph, published in St. John, in which it was alleged the libel in question was published, the proprietor, Mr. Elder, says with reference to his paper and his dealings with the defendants:\u2014\nIt is an important part of the business of my paper to publish telegraphic news. I take a good deal of news from the defendants' company from the Upper Provinces and Maritime Provinces, including Halifax. That practice has existed from soon after the defendant's company was established\u2014prior to 7th January, in the year 1879. The terms were so much per hundred words, according to the quantity. I cannot specify the exact price we paid for those telegrams. We only pay for such telegrams as we are able to use. We get a large quantity which we often do not use from want of space or having other more interesting matter, and then we only pay for what we use unless they are from our own correspondent. In the case of telegrams supplied to us by the Dominion Telegraph Company we only pay for such as we use. The Dominion Telegraph Company has an office at Saint John, N. B. Mr. Snyder is the head man there. He has been there from the first establishment of the company, before the 7th of January, 1879. I do not know his Christian name. The paper now produced and shown me is a copy of my paper. The \"Daily Telegraph\" of seventh January, 1879, published at Saint John. It is marked by me Bc. M. T. That paper has a large circulation for the Maritime Provinces. It circulates outside of the Province of New Brunswick, in Nova Scotia, P. E. Island, Quebec, Ontario, and United States, with a small circulation in England. I take it that Snyder was acting as agent of the company. The tolls for our telegrams are paid to Mr. Snyder. They are settled weekly or monthly when the bills are sent in. There is not any other telegram published in my paper of January 7th, 1879, under the head of \"Halifax,\" except that already referred to. The evening edition of my paper does not circulate so largely as that of the morning. It circulates outside of New Brunswick in the Upper Provinces by night mail but not so largely as that of the morning. The paper marked by the Commissioner is one of the morning edition of my paper.\nOn his cross-examination he says:\nI only know that Snyder is the manager of the defendants' company from seeing him in their office and paying him the bills of the telegraph company. I only know that they are bills of the Dominion Telegraph Company from the fact that they are rendered in their name by Snyder. (Objected to by Thompson, W. T.) I paid Snyder a certain sum for tolls for the compiling and transmission of the news by telegram. Snyder's telegram (for, say one hundred words,) might cost less than the same number from my own correspondent, because of the large quantity we get from Snyder. I also get telegrams from the Western Union Telegraph Company, which are published in both editions of my paper. Snyder appears to me to be the head of the office of defendants in St. John, and there are other operators there also.\nAs to the telegram in question, Mr. Elder says: My attention to this telegram was first called about January 6, 1879, by a telegram from the Dominion Telegraph Company, saying \"That the prior telegram was not correct.\" I have no direct knowledge of the second telegram coming from the defendant company, except that it was brought to me, and I had to write a paragraph on it. Neither of those telegrams was preserved.\nAnd again:\nMy attention was called to the telegram under the head of \"Halifax\" on first page of seventh of January, 1879, on the same day. It was corrected in the evening edition. I got the telegram from the defendants stating the prior telegram was incorrect on the same day in time for the evening edition. I had a conversation with Mr. Snyder afterwards about the first telegram. I complained to him of that telegram which we had to correct. He expressed his regret that it had occurred. I complained that the matter we had received from him by telegram was not correct, and that it was a serious matter for us that it should not be correct. His reply was \"that they were very sorry about it and would caution the party who had transmitted it to be more careful in future,\" or words to that effect. I had at that time in Halifax a friend who was authorized to send me news. The telegram in question of the 7th January, 1879, was not transmitted by him. Snyder informed me that he had received the news in the telegram from the party in Halifax who compiled the news from him. I do not think the name of the company was used at all. My transactions were entirely with Mr. Snyder.\nOn cross examination:\nBoth of the telegrams already referred to, came from the same sources as far as I know. (This paper also put in, subject to objection by Attorney General marked \"C\" W. T.) I do not know where these telegrams came from, except from conversation with members of my staff and with Mr. Snyder. I never saw the originals of these telegrams. The first telegram received and published in the Daily Telegraph was as follows:\u2014\nThe Daily Telegraph,\nSt. John, N. B., Tuesday, January 7th 1879.\nHalifax, Jan. 6.\nJohn Silver & Co., Wholsale Clothiers, of Granville Street, failed to-day, liabilities heavy. Howard C. Evans & Co., Commission Merchants and Lobster Packers failed: liabilities about $20,000.\nJohn S. MacLean & Co., of this City, are large creditors of Carvell Bros., Charlottetown, P. E. 1., who failed on Saturday with liabilities of $100,000. The Steamer Carroll arrived from Boston and the Cortes from Newfoundland this morning.\nMr. Thompson says as to this telegram:\u2014\nI am employed in the office of the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Have been in that office since some time in 1875. I was there on the 6th and 7th of January last. I was a reporter and attended to the despatches that came to the two evening editions. I saw the despatch headed \"Halifax\" which was published in the evening editions of the Telegraph of 7th January, 1879, (already put in evidence, W. T.), I received it from the Dominion Telegraph carrier. I suppose I may call him the boy who brings the despatches from the Dominion Telegraph Company's office. (Objected to by Mr. Rigby.) I opened it. I think that telegram appeared in the first evening edition of the paper of the 6th. It appeared in the second evening edition, I read the proof of it with copy. The print in the paper is a true copy of that telegram, except that the word \"of\" before Granville street may have been inserted. That telegram was written on manifold paper. That is the kind of paper which the telegrams furnished by the Dominion Company (without being from any correspondent) are on. I do not think it had any signature (Objected to by Mr. Rigby, W. T.) The telegrams after they are printed or used are either thrown in the waste paper basket or on the floor. That is after proof reading. They are not preserved. The first evening edition of the Telegraph is published at three o'clock, p.m.; the next one at five p.m.\nCross-examined by Mr. Rigby:\nI was in the office when the first telegram was received. It was a paper with a despatch on it; not in an envelope. We get despatches from the Western Union Telegraph Company on manifold paper, but on a different kind of paper from that which we get from the Dominion Telegraph Company. I only know that the boy who delivered the messages was in the employ of the Dominion Telegraph Company, from the fact that he brought their messages and that the other boys told me so. Also received the second telegram correcting the first one. Knew that the matter of the evening edition is transferred to the morning edition. The corrected telegram was on the same kind of paper as the first. I do not know the boy's name, or his appearance, who delivered those telegrams. The defendants company have two or three messengers I knew it was a Dominion Telegraph message from the fact that it was brought by one of the same messengers, and on the same kind of paper on which their messages were usually written, as we usually get messages from them. Re-examined by Attorney General:\nThere are only two telegraph companies doing business in St. John. The Western Union Telegraph Company and the Dominion Telegraph Company. I know that the paper on which these telegrams were written was the Dominion Company's paper, from the fact that I have been in their office and received messages on similar paper.\nA notice to defendants to produce the original telegram was proved and its production called for, but it was not forthcoming and no excuse or explanation appears to be offered for its non-production. This is the whole evidence in the case in reference to the transmission and publication of this telegram. A motion for a nonsuit appears to have been made on two grounds only: no evidence of publication by the defendants; no evidence of malice. The defendants called no witnesses. I am at a loss to conceive how a plaintiff could give stronger prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the company themselves having collected and transmitted this news for publication. Surely, if what Mr. Elder and Mr. Thompson say is not correct, who had the means within themselves of correcting or contradicting it but the defendants? The cause was tried at Halifax. If that telegram was not transmitted by defendants from Halifax, who could so well have shewn that but they themselves? If it could have availed them to have shown that the material forming this telegram was transmitted by a third party, with whom they had nothing to do, which I do not think, except, possibly, as affecting the question of damages, who could have shown that fact and the circumstances connected with the sending of that message but themselves? Defendants' office at Halifax contained all the information that could be had on this point, why did they not produce the original telegram? Why was the telegram without a name subscribed to it? In the absence of such evidence, is it possible that any jury could come to any other conclusion than that the telegraph company, with a view to its business, caused this information to be procured, and that the person referred to by Mr. Snyder, when he said \"he would caution the party who had transmitted it to be more careful in the future,\" was a servant of the company. If he was not, who knew who he was but the company, and therefore who could show this fact but the company? If they have not chosen to do so, can they complain of an inference which appears to be irresistible being drawn against them? So with reference to what took place at St. John the same observations apply. The company have an office in St. John doing business there. Mr. Elder deals with them through a man who is their manager or head man in that city, and who has been there from the first establishment of the company. He receives bills rendered by Snyder in the name of the company for his tolls; they are settled weekly or monthly. The tolls are paid to Snyder for the compiling and transmitting of the news by telegraph by the company. He receives these telegrams from the company. He has an arrangement by which the terms on which he receives them are fixed; he receives these telegrams written on defendants' paper, delivered by defendants' messenger, and when the incorrectness of this telegram is discovered, it is communicated to him by a message from the company. He complains to Snyder as manager of the company, who expresses regret, for this is the effect of Mr. Elder's testimony, and all this is allowed to go to the jury uncontradicted and unchallenged; and as in the doings at Halifax so here as to those in St. John; who but the defendants had the means of showing that this telegram never was sent from defendants' office to the \"Daily Telegraph\" office for publication? who but the defendants could have shown that Snyder was not the head man or manager and had nothing to do with the company, or that they were in no way responsible for his acts, or that no messenger of the company ever delivered the message, in other words, that the company had nothing to do with the transmission, delivery or publication of the message, but the company themselves through their officers, agents and servants in St. John? If Mr. Elder's view was incorrect, all this information being solely within the possession of the company's agent's and servants, they have not offered a tittle of evidence to contradict, alter, or explain this evidence. What jury, I ask again, could honestly come to any other conclusion than that this message, compiled and transmitted by the company at Halifax, was in due course of the business of the company received at the defendant's office at St. John and was, under the defendants' agreement with Mr. Elder, sent by the servants of the company to the Dominion Telegraph office for publication, and that all Mr. Elder's dealings with this company were through Mr. Snyder, the head man and accredited agent at St. John, and for all whose acts and doings in the course of such dealings they were responsible. If this be so, I am at a loss to understand how they are to escape liability for the publication of this clearly libellous matter any more than the proprietor of the paper could be, had he been sued. What better scheme could be devised that would ensure the circulation of a libel, than thus putting it in the shape of a telegram and sending it to a newspaper to be published as a piece of news in which the public were interested? It has been suggested that the transmission of news for publication in newspapers is not within the legitimate business for which telegraph companies are incorporated. I fail to appreciate the force of this objection; as newspapers are now a necessity, so at this day is telegraphic news for publication in newspapers. No newspaper published in a city such as St. John could exist as a leading influential journal without telegraphic news. To say that the transmission of such news by telegraph companies over telegraphic lines is not a legitimate branch of their business, and a large source of revenue is to ignore what is presented before our eyes every day, when we take up a morning or evening paper. To say that we can suppose that all such news is transmitted by such company gratuitously for the pleasure of operating, or for any love the company bear either the publishers who print or the public who read newspapers, or from any philantrophic desire to spread intelligence, and to say that they can transmit, not correct statements, but whatever so called news or rumours they may collect, or what may be collected for them by others of a sensational character, without regard to its truth or falsity or libellous character, and so derive a large revenue and not be responsible to those who may be injured, or possibly ruined by such participation in the publication of gross libels, and which libels would not and could not be published but through their instrumentality, would be simply to stultify ourselves. Can it be possible that the character and business of innocent persons can be destroyed because the libellers, with a view to gain and the extension of their business, choose to transmit over their lines statements and rumors unfounded in fact in relation to the private character or business standing of individuals with whom they have no connection, and with whose character or business they have no right to meddle, and when no duty, legal, moral or social is cast upon them to promulgate the statements or rumours, and the aggrieved parties shall have no remedy against them? The law has not, and I am full well assured never will, sanction such an idea. The legislature never meant, as said by Brett, J., in Williamson v. Freer[27], \"that the facilities for telegraphic communication should be used for the purpose of disseminating libels.\" To exempt telegraph companies from liability as now claimed would be to clothe them with an irresponsible power for the perpetration of injustice and wrong wholly opposed to every principle of law or right.\nI am at a loss to understand how a newspaper proprietor can be liable for the publication of a libel and the party who prepares the libel and delivers it at the office of the newspaper for publication, and without whose acts no publication of the libellous matter could take place, can escape an equal liability with the printer or publisher of the paper: they are all engaged in one and the same transaction, viz: collecting, transmitting and publishing matter collected, the aid and participation of all being necessary to the publication.\nThat a libel may be published by transmission through the Electric Telegraph is a proposition for which I should think no authority was required, but the case of Whitfield v. S. E. Ry. Co.[28] is clear on this point, though not so strong a case in its circumstances as this. Plaintiffs were bankers carrying on business as such and issuing notes under the firm of the The Lewes Old Bank; the defendants were proprietors of, and by their servants and agents, managed a certain system of electric telegraph upon and over their line of railway for the purpose of enabling, and so as to enable, the defendants to transmit messages from one to another of their stations, and the defendants transmitted messages thereby and had the care and custody of all messages transmitted, yet defendants while plaintiffs were such bankers, &c., by means of said telegraph transmitted, sent and published from, to wit: Ticehurst Road Station to wit to Hastings Station and there falsely and maliciously caused to be written, printed, copied, circulated and published the false, &c., words and message following that is to say:\u2014\"The Lewes Bank,\" thereby meaning and intending the old Lewes Bank, \"has stopped payment.\"\nOn demurrer, judgment was delivered by Lord Campbell in favor of plaintiffs.\nIn Edwards v. Midland Railway Co.[29], Fry, J., said: \u2014\nThose who deny that the company can be made liable (the question being whether a railway company can be made liable in an action for malicious prosecution), rely principally on Baron Alderson's judgment in Stevens v. Midland Counties Ry. Co.[30], where he held that in order to support such an action it must be shewn that the defendant was actuated by a motive in his mind, and that a corporation has no mind. The two other judges, Barons Platt and Martin, did not agree with Baron Alderson's reasons, but decided in the company's favor on other grounds.\nHas Baron Alderson's opinion, which in that case stands alone, been followed by other judges? In Rex v. City of London, which is cited in a note to Whitfield v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[31] it was held on demurrer that an action would lie against the corporation of the city of London for maliciously publishing a libel, and though that decision is not of the greatest weight, being affected no doubt by political as well as legal considerations, still it was assented to by Chief Justice Saunders, an able and experienced judge. In Yarborough v. Bank of England[32], Lord Ellenborough referred to an earlier case of Argent v. Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's[33], and said that the instances of actions against corporations for false returns to writs of mandamus must be numberless. Again in Whitfield v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[34] Lord Campbell says that \"the ground on which it is contended that an action for a libel cannot possibly be maintained against a corporation aggregate fails,\" and \"considering that an action of tort and trespass will lie against a corporation aggregate and that an indictment may be preferred against a corporation aggregate both for commission and omission, to be followed up by fine, though not by imprisonment, there may be great difficulty in saying that, under certain circumstances, express malice may not be imputed to and proved against a corporation.\" In Green v. London General Omnibus Co.[35], it was held that a corporation aggregate may be liable to an action for intentional acts of misfeasance by its servants, provided they are sufficiently connected with the scope and object of its incorporation. There Chief Justice Erle says: \"The ground of the demurrer is, that the declaration charges a wilful and intentional wrong, and that the defendants, being a corporation, cannot be guilty of such a wrong, and therefore the action will not lie.\" In the case before me it is similarly argued that a corporation cannot act maliciously or intentionally, because malice and intention imply mind. Chief Justice Erle continues: \"The doctrine relied on that a corporation having no soul cannot be actuated by a malicious intention is more quaint than substantial.\" In other words, the ratio decidendi of Baron Alderson was in this case disregarded, and as his decision has not been followed in English Courts, I am at liberty to decide in conformity with the later decisions, and I hold, therefore, that the action will lie in this case.\nIn Scott & Janrigan's law of Telegraphs[36], it is said:\nA side from the statutory and common law duty of good faith in the transmission of messages for the public, there is another sense in which telegraph companies may become responsible for mala fides and malicious use of its functions. A libel is any false, malicious, and personal imputation effected by any writings, pictures, or signs tending to alter the party's situation in society or business for the worse, and a corporation may become responsible for its publication even in punitive damages. Citing many cases.\u2014\nIn the transmission of messages for publication, especially letters and news for the public newspapers, it would seem that telegraph companies assume a responsibility similar to that of the publishers. By this agency libellous matter would be necessarily brought to the knowledge of operators who otherwise would not have cognizance of it. By their immediate and indispensable agency, \"press despatches\" and the like are brought before the public. In communications specially designed for the press, we see no reason why they should not stand on the same footing with publishers. But in strictly private messages the reason for so stringent a rule does not obtain, perhaps should not be applied at all. See White v. Nicholls[37].\nI assent to a new trial, on the ground of the damages being excessive, with great doubt and some reluctance. The evidence may not be as full and precise as it might have been, but the extent of plaintiff's business as a wholesale importing house in Halifax, where the cause was tried, was doubtless well known to the jury, and they were, I should think, competent to estimate the injury to such a business by the promulgation of such a report, and to give, as I think they have done, general damages.\nIn Russell et al v. Webster[38], Bramwell, B., says:\nWhen it is left to the jury to say whether a statement is defamatory, and they find it to be so, then they may give general damages, that is, I suppose, damages, according to their discretion, under all the circumstances of the case.\nPigott, B., says:\nAs it is a libel on the conductors of the newspaper, there is no need to prove either malice or special damage and the jury are justified in finding general damages: Ingram v. Ingram[39].\nBut this is immaterial, as the rest of the court think there should be a new trial on the ground of excessive damages.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis being an action for libel, or written slander, actual damage is not an element of the cause of action, and consequently no allegation or proof of any was requisite to entitle the plaintiff to maintain the action. Even words spoken imputing insolvency to traders are actionable per se[40], and in such cases the plaintiff can recover substantial damages without alleging or proving any special damage[41]. If, however, the plaintiff, either in libel, or in actions for defamatory words actionable per se, seeks to prove any special damage, this must be alleged in the declaration, and in the absence of such an allegation evidence of it is not admissible[42].\nIn William's notes to Saunder's[43] it is said:\nBut if the plaintiff has sustained any special damage he must state it, for it is an established rule that no evidence shall be received of any loss or injury which the plaintiff has sustained by the speaking of the words, unless it be specially stated in the declaration. In 1 St. 666, Browning v. Newman, Lord Raymond took a distinction between the case when the special damage is the gist of the action and when the words are in themselves actionable; that in the former evidence of special damage is allowed, though the particular instances of such damages are not specified in the declaration, but in the latter case particular instances of special damage shall not be given in evidence unless particularised in the declaration. * * * However, modern practice does not warrant this distinction, for it seems now fully established that in each case the special damage must be alike particularly specified in the declaration.\nAnd this principle applies where the damage relied on is the act of a third party to the prejudice of the plaintiff, induced by the slander or libel complained of. In such a case evidence of the prejudicial act of the third person ought to be rejected if it is not pleaded in the declaration.\nThe declaration in the present case contains no averment of special damage caused to the plaintiffs by reason of the refusal of Carvell, McKeen & Co., to sell them exchange in consequence of the publication of the alleged libel. The evidence of Mr. Mather and Mr. McKeen was, however, notwithstanding the silence of the declaration in respect of the damage which they were called to prove, admitted against the objection of the defendant's counsel to its reception. It appears to me, therefore, that there was an improper reception of evidence which was sufficiently objected to at the trial, and that the rule nisi which was granted on these, as well as on other grounds, ought for this reason, if for no other, to have been made absolute; and consequently that this appeal should be allowed with costs\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nAs we have power now, by the last amendments to the Supreme Court Act, to order a new trial, we ought to exercise that discretion in this case. I may say that I have seldom seen any case in which there was so little evidence as in this. Certainly there is none to justify the verdict that has been given for $7,000. I take the view that it is excessive, and that a new trial ought to be ordered.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI agree with brother Strong and the learned Chief Justice, and, I presume, with a majority of this Court, that the evidence of publication by the defendant company was fully established. I think the party was entitled to recover damages and I do not feel that I should set aside this verdict on the ground stated by my brother Strong--that is, on the improper reception of evidence. I cannot recollect now exactly whether that was objected to or not, but whether it was or not I consider that it was legitimate evidence that might be given in the case. I am of opinion that the statute does not alter, nor was it intended to alter, the principles on which this court could set aside the verdict of a jury where the whole duty of finding damages is, as in cases of libel and slander, with the jury. There is nothing to shock one as to the extent of these damages. There is evidence here that the plaintiffs were extensive importing wholesale merchants in the city of Halifax, and it is in evidence that shortly after the publication of this libel they failed. Now the jury, taken from the city of Halifax where the plaintiffs reside, would have a much better opportunity of knowing what damages they should receive than strangers a thousand miles away, sitting in this court. I do not think it was the intention of Parliament, in that amendment to the statute, to alter the law with respect to the prerogative right of a jury to assess damages in a case like this. I think we have no right to interfere with the damages on that ground, and I think we have no evidence upon which we can arrive at the conclusion that these damages were improperly given by the jury. I think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.: \u2014\nI concur in Judge Gwynne's observations, and have come to the same conclusion upon the same grounds.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed, the verdict should be set aside and the Rule Nisi for a new trial be ordered to be made absolute in the Court below.\nI do not see how this verdict can be sustained, nor how the defendants can be held responsible for the publication in the St. John Daily Telegraph, which is the publication complained of, unless they are responsible in all cases for the use which the receivers of telegraphic messages transmitted over the defendants' line may make of such messages when received, and so to hold would, as it appears to me, be subversive of the telegraphic system and destructive of the benefits conferred upon the public by an invention without which it would be impossible that the affairs of the world could in the present age be conducted. The company by their charter are bound to transmit all despatches received by them for transmission in the order in which they are received, (subject to certain specific exceptions,) under heavy pecuniary penalties. It would be impossible for them to comply with this provision of the statute if they should be compelled, or it was a duty imposed upon them by law in order to their own protection, to enquire into the truth of matter stated in the despatches delivered to them for transmission at the peril, in case of neglect to do so, of being responsible in damages if such matter should be libellous.\nThe Legislature, alive to the fact that improper use might be made by the company's servants of the information received by them through the medium of telegraphic messages, affecting the private affairs of individuals, have made a provision which appeared to them to be adequate to prevent the injury by enacting that any operator or person employed by the telegraph company divulging the contents of a private despatch should be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction should be liable to a fine not exceeding $100, or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, or both, in the discretion of the court before whom the conviction should be had.\nThe third count of the declaration seems to be framed with the view of meeting the objection which I have suggested as to the company being made responsible for the use made by the receivers of telegraphic despatches of the information therein contained, for it is there alleged that the defendants themselves, that is that the corporate body, entered into an agreement with the proprietor of the St. John Daily Telegraph to become in effect his agents to collect, compile, and to transmit to him over the defendants' line of telegraph, news items, which, in case such proprietor should make use of them by publishing in his paper, he would pay the defendants an agreed upon sum for every hundred words used. The defendants file a plea denying that they made any such agreement, and they are entitled to have that issue disposed of by being found either in their favor or against them, and if the making of that agreement by the defendants be necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to recover under their third count, it is incumbent upon them to prove that such agreement was entered into in such a manner as to be binding upon a corporate body; a point which involves the necessity of proof that the collecting and compiling news items for the proprietor of a newspaper constituted part of the corporate purposes for which the defendants were incorporated.\nThe gist of this count seems to be that the plaintiffs contend that the telegraphic message containing the matter complained of was not delivered to the defendants by any individual, to be transmitted over their line by the defendants in the ordinary course of business, as transmitters merely of telegraphic messages delivered to them for transmission, but that the defendants themselves, as the agents of the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, originated the message and delivered it, as it were to themselves for transmission, and so that it was not a message which it was incumbent upon them to transmit under the provisions of their Act of incorporation, as to the transmission of despatches in the order of their receipt by the defendants.\nThe plaintiffs offer no evidence to prove, nor does the witness called by them, viz., the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph allege, that the defendants entered into the agreement of which he spoke in his evidence under their corporate seal, or that it was entered into in pursuance of any resolution of the board of directors, nor even with any officer of the company at their head office. He says that his transactions were entirely with Mr. Snyder, and that he does not think the name of the company was ever mentioned. Neither was there any evidence offered to show what the duties attached to the office which Mr. Snyder filled in the service of the company were, so as to enable the court or jury to say whether they were such as to enable him to bind the company to the extent which is claimed. It might well be within the limits of his ordinary duty in the employment in which he was engaged as a servant of the defendants to agree with the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph for the amount which he should pay for all telegraphic despatches coming over the defendants' line without his having any authority to enter into a contract such as that alleged whereby the defendants should become the agents of, and the compilers of news items for, the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph and chargeable therefore with all the consequences attaching by law to the assumption of such agency. It might even well be that, while Mr. Snyder should himself assume the agency and all the responsibilities attaching thereto, the defendants should permit him to contract upon their behalf as to the tolls which they should receive for the transmission of the messages brought to their office by Snyder or persons employed by him, without the defendants assuming any responsibility as to the collecting or compiling the news. The evidence of the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph is in my judgment quite consistent with this having been the nature of the arrangement. I can see nothing in the evidence from which it can, I think, be said as matter of law or of fact that the collection of news items by the defendants for the proprietors of newspapers and as their agents, is clearly part of the business for conducting which the defendants were incorporated, or which can make the act of Snyder, in entering into the agreement spoken of, the act of the defendants, or which would make the act of Snyder, or of any person employed by him, in collecting and compiling the news and bringing it to the defendants' office for transmission, the act of the defendants themselves. The plaintiffs should at least have offered evidence to show who it was that brought the message to the defendants' office at Halifax for transmission. Snyder (as the witness called, said) informed him it was a person employed by him to collect the news\u2014however the onus probandi lay upon the plaintiffs, and they and not the defendants must bear the consequences, whatever they may be, of the want of such evidence.\nBut assuming the agreement for the collecting and compiling the news items for the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph to be one within the scope of the purposes for which the defendants were incorporated, and that Snyder had sufficient authority to enter into it on behalf of the defendants, and that the latter assumed the agency, a question still remains which appears to be equally applicable to all the counts.\nIf the defendants collected, compiled, and transmitted news items for the proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, they did so as his confidential agents and at his request, just as if any individual and not the defendants had become agent of the proprietor of the paper for the like purpose. The agency of the defendants then was at an end when they delivered the despatch in question to the proprietor and publisher of the Daily Telegraph at St. John. The publication complained of, and for which the damages have been awarded against the defendants, is not the delivery of the despatch, but the publication of it in the paper. The defendants are charged with having published and caused to be published the matter complained of in the St. John Daily Telegraph, and the grievance is the circulation which it thereby obtained. Now, with that publication the defendants had, in fact, nothing to do. They did not request or procure the proprietor of the paper to publish it in his paper, nor was it inserted therein to gratify any purpose of the defendants. The proprietor admits that he, himself, exercised sole power to deal with these news despatches, as seemed fit to him in the sole and uncontrolled exercise of his own discretion. He, alone and for his own purposes, inserted the intelligence in his paper. He alone can be made responsible to third persons for acts done by him in the uncontrolled exercise of his own discretion. The case is wholly different from that of a person paying for, or for his own purposes requesting and procuring a publisher of a newspaper to give the benefit of the circulation of his paper to some matter which may prove to be libellous. There the publisher is the agent of the person so procuring the matter to be published and the maxim respondeat superior may well apply; but here the publisher, without any request or procurement of the defendants, and in the sole and uncontrolled exercise of his own discretion, for his own purposes, namely, the credit and profit obtained by his showing himself to be an industrious collector of news items, inserts the matter in his own paper\u2014that is his act for which he alone is responsible[44]; and such, his act cannot, as it appears to me, be said to be the act of the defendants, nor for such publication can the defendants be held responsible, unless as I have at the outset suggested, they are to be held responsible to all persons for whatever use the receivers of telegraphic despatches passing over their line may, for their own purposes and in the pursuit of their business, make of such despatches\u2014a responsibility for subjecting the defendants to which I think there is no warrant. These points, do not seem to me, to have received that consideration in the court below which the gravity of the liability sought to be imposed upon the defendants seems to demand.\nHowever, assuming the action upon the evidence given to lie against the defendants, this verdict upon the point as to damages alone cannot, in my opinion, be permitted to stand. The damages have not only been awarded in error upon evidence which was not admissible, but the enormous sum of $7,000 has been arbitrarily awarded to compensate injury alleged to be done to the plaintiff's trade, in the absence of any evidence whatever, that such trade was as matter of fact in any respect injured or diminished by the alleged slander, which was proved to have been corrected in the same paper the same day that it was published, and such correction repeated again in the issue of the same paper on the following day. The verdict is, in my judgment, irreconcilable with the idea that the jury proceeded upon any principle which should govern them in the discharge of their duty of estimating the damages, so as to make them bear some rational proportion to the evidence laid before them of the amount of injury done to the plaintiff's trade for recompensing which the action was brought.\nIt is said that the words complained of, having reference to the plaintiffs trade, are actionable per se without proof of any special damage, but though true it is that to impute insolvency to persons in trade is actionable per se, yet that does not relieve a plaintiff who seeks substantial damages for an alleged injury from the obligation of giving to the jury some evidence of the extent of that injury, so as to enable them to discharge the duty devolving upon them of apportioning the damages to the injury as shown to them to have been sustained. Where the injury complained of is injury to a trade of which the jury can know nothing without evidence, it is impossible for them intelligently to discharge their duty unless some general evidence be given of what the business was before, and that it became diminished after the publication, from which the jury can form some rational opinion of the extent of the injury for which they are called upon to give compensation. To hold that upon the mere allegation by the plaintiffs in their declaration that their trade has sustained an injury, to establish which allegation they offer no evidence, a jury may arbitrarily give as damages any sum however large, as for example $7,000, merely because words imputing insolvency to persons in trade, are actionable per se, would, as it appears to me, be a mockery of justice; and is a proposition in support of which I have not been able to find any reported decision.\nIn 3 B. & C. 427 is reported a case of Tripp v. Thomas where the words for which the action was brought imputed to the plaintiff a very grave indictable offence, namely, subornation of perjury, and the defendant allowed judgment to go by default. The jury assessed the damages at \u00a340. Upon a motion to set aside the assessment of damages, the rule was refused because the words being actionable per se and the charge was admitted by the judgment by default, and there was nothing in the small amount of damages given from which it could be presumed that the damages were estimated upon erroneous grounds. There, it is to be observed, from the nature of the charge itself which was admitted on the record by the judgment by default, a jury could form some estimate of the damages proper to be awarded, and they gave a moderate sum, which could not be said to be disproportionate to the injury naturally flowing from the words complained of and admitted; but in an action which (although for words which are actionable per se) is nevertheless brought to recover compensation for an injury alleged to have been sustained in the plaintiffs trade, how can a jury say what damage a trade has sustained if they are given no evidence of what the extent of the trade was before and what after the publication of the libel, which is said to have injured it? In actions of this nature it is always customary to give some general evidence of loss of trade following upon the publication, and I think it will be found that the contention has most frequently arisen upon attempts by plaintiffs to give evidence of what the defendant has insisted was particular damage not alleged and therefore inadmissible.\nIn Ingram v. Lawson[45], which was the case of a libel charging that a ship of, which the plaintiff was owner and master, and which he had advertised for a voyage to the East Indies, was not seaworthy, the plaintiff gave proof at the trial of what was the average profit of the Captain of a ship on an East Indian voyage and that upon his first voyage after the publication of the libel his profits were nearly \u00a31,500 below the average and the jury awarded \u00a3900. In that case upon a motion for a new trial, it having been objected that the evidence should not have been received, Coltman, J., said:\u2014\nWith respect to damages the jury must have some mode of estimating them and they could not be in a condition to do so unless they knew something of the nature of the plaintiff's business and of the general return from his voyages.\nAnd Erskine, J., said:\u2014\nIn order to enable the jury to form some judgment as to the effect the libel was calculated to produce I think it was reasonable to let them know the nature of the plaintiff's business and the amount realized by him in his various voyages.\nThe established rule in all cases, whether of actions for words actionable per se or actionable only when accompanied by special damage, is, that no evidence of particular damage can be given unless it is alleged in the declaration, and the general allegation of loss of customers is not sufficient to enable a plaintiff to shew a particular injury or the loss of a particular customer. This also is the law as laid down by the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Tobias v Horland[46]. In Rose v. Groves[47], Cresswell, J., says:\u2014\nIn actions for slandering a man in his trade, where the declaration alleges that he thereby lost his trade, he may shew a general damage done to his trade, though he cannot give evidence of particular instances.\nIn Evans v. Harries[48], which was an action for slander of plaintiff in his business of an inn-keeper, the plaintiff was permitted to prove that his business was less and that many customers, not particularizing any, had ceased to come to his house since the utterance of the slander. The jury gave a verdict for \u00a320. Upon a motion to set aside this verdict upon the ground that the evidence was, as was contended, special damages not averred, Martin, B., said:\nHow is a public house keeper, whose only customers are persons passing by, to show damage resulting from the slander unless he is allowed to give general evidence of loss of custom.\nIn Dixon v. Smith[49], which was an action by a surgeon for slander, by reason of which D. would not employ him as an accoucheur, and that the plaintiff was otherwise injured in the way of his business\u2014it was proved that the words were spoken by the defendant in conversation with D. The plaintiff's fee for attendance on D. would have been a guinea or two guineas, and the plaintiff also proved that since the utterance of the slander his business, particularly in midwifery cases, had fallen off to the extent of one-third. The learned judge, who tried the case, directing the jury as to their duty, told them that:\nThey might take into consideration how much the plaintiff's business fell off in consequence of what the defendant said, but that they must be cautious not to give damages for any injury not arising from the words of the defendant, and that he was not answerable for damage arising from repetitions of the slander.\nThe jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff with \u00a350 damages, a rule nisi was obtained to set it aside on the ground of the improper reception of evidence of general loss of patients and diminution of business; 2nd, for misdirection in telling the jury that they might take into consideration such loss in assessing the damages; and, 3rd, on the ground that the damages were excessive.\nAll the judges constituting the court were of opinion that the jury were not at liberty to give such general damages as they had given; that the evidence was admissible and the charge unobjectionable, but they were of opinion that the decline of plaintiff's business as spoken of in evidence could not have arisen from the speaking of the slanderous words by the defendant to D., and that for repetitions of the slander the defendant was not responsible, and therefore the damages were pronounced to be excessive. This case has a most important bearing upon the present case as establishing the duty of the jury to be to apportion the damages to the extent of the injury proved before them to be attributable to the act of the defendant, and as showing that the defendants here are not responsible for the act of the proprietor and publisher of the Daily Telegraph in publishing the information the defendants had given him, that being the uncontrolled and independent act of the publisher of the paper himself for which he alone was responsible. In Riding v Smith[50] the authority of Evans v. Harries, that general evidence of loss of business in an action of slander for words spoken of a plaintiff in reference to his trade is proper and admissible is recognised, and indeed such evidence to enable a jury intelligently to discharge their duty seems to me to be necessary to this extent that, although without any such evidence some moderate damages might be given as recoverable in law by reason of the words being actionable in themselves, yet if the jury should give damages of a large amount, such as the damages of $7,000 given here, their verdict cannot be supported but must be set aside as evidencing either ignorance or disregard of their duty on the part of the jury. This verdict therefore must be set aside as given in error upon the evidence of McKeen and Mathers which was inadmissible as pointing to a particular or special damage not complained of in the declaration. But the verdict should be equally set aside even if that evidence had been admissible, for that evidence, properly considered, does not warrant the attributing McKeen's direction to his agent Mathers to cease dealing with the plaintiffs to the publication in the Daily Telegraph of the 7th January, 1879, which is complained of, for granting the paper of that date to be the one which McKeen saw, all that it induced him to do was to write to his agent to make enquiries as to its correctness\u2014he asks him in his letter written upon seeing the publication\u2014\"what about Silver?\" and what Mr. Mathers did upon the receipt of this was to make private enquiries himself about the plaintiffs, and although he does not tell us what was the result of his enquiries, he, no doubt, did imform his principal, McKeen, who, as I gathered from the evidence, thereupon, and nine or ten days after the item now complained of had been corrected in the same paper in which the first and objectionable publication had appeared, forbids him to deal any more with the plaintiffs.\nNow, McKeen & Co. were never customers of the plaintiffs in the sense of being purchasers from them of any of the articles of their trade. Their sole business connection consisted in McKeen of Co. selling exchange to the plaintiffs, when the latter applied for it, taking the plaintiffs' promissory notes therefor. That the plaintiffs had any occasion for or wanted to purchase exchange, or applied to McKeen & Co. for that purpose after the 7th January, 1879, was not suggested. That they, in fact, failed shortly afterwards is admitted from, causes, it may be presumed, which existed prior to the 7th January, for it has not been suggested that the publication of that date in the Daily Telegraph contributed in the slightest degree to that event. The effect of McKeen & Co's. instructions to their agent Mathers was not to sell any more exchange to the plaintiffs, if they should apply for it, and it is obvious that if they should not want to purchase exchange, or should not apply for that purpose to McKeen & Co., the latter's instructions to their agent Mathers could do no injury to the plaintiff's trade, and these instructions, not having been given until after the expiration of several days after the publication complained of had been corrected in the same public manner in which the libel had been published, and after Mathers had made his own private enquiries into the affairs of the plaintiffs, and after, as we may presume, he had communicated the result to his principals, a strong presumption is raised that McKeen's prohibition to Mathers to deal any more with the plaintiffs is attributable to the result of Mathers enquiries being unfavorable to the plaintiffs, rather than to the publication in the Daily Telegraph, which had been corrected, so that, as it seems to me, it is impossible to regard the $7,000 given by the jury, even though the defendants should be liable for that publication, otherwise than as exorbitant in the extreme and unwarranted by any evidence.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Rigby & Tapper.\nSolicitors for respondents: Meagher, Chisholm & Ritchie.\n[1] 2 Russ. & Geldert 17.\n[2] 1 Moore 479.\n[3] L.

Ont., ch. 104\u2014Wrongful Distress for Mortgage money\u2014Attornment clause.\nA mortgage made in pursuance of the Act respecting Short Forms of Mortgages, R.S.O., ch. 104, in addition to all the clauses mentioned in the statute, contained the following provision and variation: \u201cAnd the mortgagor doth release to the company all his claims upon the said lands, and doth attorn to and become tenant at will to the company, subject to the said proviso.\u201d Among the statutory clauses in the mortgage were those providing that the mortgagees on default of payment for two months, might on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the lands; that they might distrain for arrears of interest, and that until default of payment, the mortgagors should have quiet possession.\nHeld, per Strong, Fournier and Henry, JJ., (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,)\u2014That upon the proper construction of the deed there was no reservation of rent entitling the mortgagees to claim a landlord\u2019s right, as against an execution creditor, of a year\u2019s arrears of interest on their mortgage before removal of goods on mortgaged premises by the sheriff.\nSir W.J. Ritchie, C.J., and Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ. contra.\nThe Court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1].\nThe following special case without pleadings was submitted by consent of the parties:\n\u201cThis is an interpleader issue directed by two several orders bearing dates respectively on the 22nd day of January, A.D. 1880, and the 18th day of February, A.D. 1880, and made by Robert G. Dalton, Esq., clerk of the Crown and Pleas, Queen\u2019s Bench, for the purpose of determining the right of the plaintiffs as against the defendants to the sum of $1,596.79 which has been paid into court in the cause of Lawrason v. Christie, and by the consent of the parties and by the order of the said Robert G. Dalton, bearing date on the 11th day of May, A.D. 1880, the following case has been stated for the opinion of the court.\n\u201c1. Under and by virtue of an indenture of mortgage, bearing date the 23rd day of March, A.D. 1877, and made between The Hon David Christie of the first part, the plaintiffs of the second part, and Margaret R. Christie, wife of the said Hon. David Christie, for the purpose of barring her dower only, of the third part, of which mortgage a true copy is hereto annexed, the plaintiffs became and have ever since the date of the said mortgage remained, mortgagees of the lands and premises in said mortgage described, for securing payment to them of the moneys which the said mortgage purports to secure at the times, and in the manner in the said mortgage provided for payment and the said mortgage was not executed by the said mortgagees.\n\u201c2. The said The Hon. David Christie remained in actual possession of the said lands under and pursuant to the provisions of the said mortgage from the date thereof until after the directing of the interpleader issue herein.\n\u201c3. Under and by virtue of a writ of fieri facias against, goods tested the 7th day of February, A.D. 1879, and issued out of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario, directed to the sheriff of the county of Brant for the having of execution of a judgment of that court recovered by the defendant Miller Lawrason in an action at his suit against the said The Hon. David Christie, and under another writ of fieri facias against goods, tested the 18th day of February, A.D 1879, and issued out of the county court of the county of Brant, directed \u2018to the said sheriff for the having of execution of a judgment of that court recovered by the defendants, William Burrill, John Heaton and Henry Wilson Darnley as executors of the last will and testament of George Wilson Darnley, deceased, in an action at their suit against the said The Hon, David Christie, and under two other several writs of fieri facias against goods tested respectively on the 18th day of February, A.D. 1879, and the 24th day of April, A.D. 1879, and issued each out of the county court of the county of Brant, and directed to the said sheriff for the having of execution of two several judgments of that court recovered by the defendant Cockshutt in two several actions at his suit against the said The Hon. David Christie, the said sheriff did in the month of December, A.D. 1879, seize and take in execution all the goods and chattels of the said? The Hon. David Christie, then lying and being upon the said lands, and he has since under and by virtue of the said writs sold and removed the said goods and chattels from the said lands.\n\u201c4. The plaintiffs, before the date either of such sale or of such removal, but some days subsequently to such seizure as aforesaid, and while the sheriff was in possession under such seizure, gave notice to the said sheriff that they claimed to be landlords of the said lands, and that the said the Hon. David Christie was their tenant, and that there was then due to them from and payable by the said the Hon David Christie for rent of the said lands for several years preceding the date of the giving of the said notice, a sum greatly exceeding $2,720, and that they required the said sheriff, before removing any of the said goods and chattels, to pay to them the sum of $2,720, as and for one year\u2019s rent of the said lands for the year next preceding the giving of the said notice.\n\u201c5. The said sheriff, after the giving of the said notice, applied to this court for relief under the Interpleader Act, when an order was made by the said Robert G. Dalton, bearing date 22nd day of January, A.D. 1880, and ordering the said sheriff to pay into court in the said cause of Lawrason v. Christie, and out of the proceeds of the sale of the said goods and chattels, a sufficient sum to cover the amount of the said execution of the defendant Lawrason, together with interest and costs up to the time of such payment, and the taxed costs of the application for the said order, to abide the result of an issue between the plaintiffs and the defendant Lawrason, and that he should pay over to the plaintiffs the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the said goods after deducting thereout his own fees, poundages and incidental expenses, together with the moneys so directed to be paid into court as aforesaid; provided that such balance should in all not exceed the said sum of $2,720.\n\u201c6. Afterwards, upon the application of the defendants Cockshutt, Burrill, Heaton and Darnley, an order was made by the said Robert G. Dalton, bearing date the 18th day of February, A. D. 1880, whereby it was ordered that the lastly mentioned order be amended, and that the sheriff should pay into court a further sum sufficient to cover the amount of the said several executions of the defendants Cockshutt, Burrill, Heaton and Darnley, together with interest thereon and costs up to the time of such payment, and that the said defendants should be added as parties defendants to said issue.\n\u201c7. The said sheriff has, in pursuance of the said orders, paid into court as thereby directed the sum of $1,596.79, and has paid to the plaintiffs the sum of $1,180.91, besides which sum the plaintiffs have not since the making of the said mortgage been paid anything on account of the moneys thereby secured, either for principal or interest, or by way of rent. The question for the opinion of the court is, whether the plaintiffs by virtue of the said mortgage or anything therein contained and of the facts hereinbefore set forth, are entitled as against the defendants to any portion of the money so paid into court as aforesaid in the cause of Lawrason v. Christie.\n\u201cIf the court shall be of opinion in the affirmative, their judgment shall be entered up for the plaintiffs for the amount of the said money so paid into court as aforesaid, together with the interest which shall then have accumulated thereon, and their costs of the said interpleader proceedings and of and incidental to their issue, to be paid by the defendants. If the court shall be of opinion in the negative, then judgment for the said moneys and accumulated interest, together with costs of defence to be paid by the plaintiffs, shall be entered up for the defendants.\u201d The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held that a tenancy at will was created by the mortgage at a fixed rent, equivalent to interest, for which the mortgagees had all the remedies of a landlord: The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of Queen\u2019s Bench and held there was no rent fixed for which there was power to distrain.\nMr. Marsh for appellant:\nThe main question that arises in the present case is one of construction of the mortgage. Is there a tenancy at a fixed rent? The statutory distress clause contained in the mortgage in question, coupled with the possession had by the mortgagees pursuant to the provisions of the mortgage, created the relationship of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and the respondents: Royal Canadian Bank v. Kelly[2].\nBy the wording of the distress clause in question, rent and interest are equivalent and interchangeable terms. The effect of this is to reduce the arrears of interest to the extent of whatever amount of interest may be collected by way of rent. This avoids the difficulty raised in some of the cases decided under other distress clauses, where it was objected that there was no provision for the application of the rent in payment of the interest. This equivalence of the rent to the interest also establishes the fact that the rent is fixed and certain, for there is no question but that the interest reserved by the mortgage is fixed and certain, and so must that be which is its equivalent. The distress clause provides that as soon as the interest falls into arrear it may be recovered \u201cby way of rent reserved.\u201d Upon reference to Webster\u2019s Dictionary, under the word \u201cway,\u201d it will be found that the phrase \u201cby way of\u201d is equal to the phrases \u201cas being,\u201d \u201cin the character of,\u201d which latter is the meaning given to it by Mr. Justice Gwynne in Royal Canadian Bank v. Kelly[3], where he considers that the rent is fixed by the use of this phrase. Upon substituting either of these two phrases, \u201cas being,\u201d \u201cin the character of,\u201d for its equivalent as used in the statutory distress clause, it will appear that the distress clause indicates not only the mode in which the overdue interest may be recovered; but also, the character in which it is to be recovered, viz., as a rent[4].\nThat part of the clause which provides that the time for payment of the principal money may be extended upon payment of arrears at any time before judgment shows that the clause in question was intended merely as a license to the mortgagees to commence action upon default, but that the mortgagees\u2019 right to treat the mortgagor as a trespasser is not complete until judgment is obtained, and in this case no action or suit was commenced after default and before the directing of the interpleader issue herein,\nClause 2 of the special case states that the mortgagor \u201cremained in actual possession of the said lands under and pursuant to the provisions of the said mortgage from the date thereof until after the directing of the interpleader issue herein,\u201d i.e., as tenant at will.\nA tenancy at will at a fixed rent having been created upon the execution of the mortgage, and the will never having been determined as is shown by clause 2 of the special case the same tenancy at the same rental still subsisted after the default[5].\nThe attornment clause in the mortgage expressly creates a tenancy at will, subject to the proviso for payment of interest, and the statutory distress clause provides that the mortgagees may distrain for interest\u201d by way of rent reserved,\u201d which should be constructed as and for rent reserved These three clauses, when read together, create a tenancy at will at a fixed rent.\nAn attornment clause in a mortgage creates the relation of landlord and tenant, with all its incident remedies.\nJolly v. Arbuthnot[6]; Morton v. Woods[7]; Re Stockton Iron Works Furnace Co.[8]; Exparte Bank of Whitehaven. Re Bowes[9]; see note to Keech v. Halt[10].\nAnother point taken is that we do not come within the provisions of 8 Anne, ch. 14, sec. 1, and as we claim under that statute we must show that we come within the meaning of that statute. There is an express case which proves conclusively that the statute of Anne extends to the case of a tenancy under an attornment clause in a mortgage. Yates v. Ratledge[11]. The same principle was acted in the case of Monroe v. Build[12].\nAnother objection taken was that appellants claim was prejudiced by the Chattel Mortgage Act In order that an instrument may be avoided by the Chattel Mortgage Act, it must be strictly within the terms of that act. The instrument in question here is not a \u201cmortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels.\u201d In England it has been held that such an attornment does not infringe upon the Bill of Sales Act. See re Stockton Iron Works Furance Co.[13]; re Bowes[14]; see also Patterson v. Kingsley[15]; and McMaster v. Garland[16]. The proper construction of this instrument may be best arrived at by applying the ordinary rules which judges have framed for the interpretation of written contracts. See Morton v. Woods[17]. The attornment clause here, if not construed together with the distress clause, so as to create a tenancy at a rent certain, will either be of no effect or will be a clausula damnosa so fax as the mortgagees are concerned, rendering them liable, in the character of mortgagees in possession, to account to subsequent incumbrancers for rents and profits which by the terms of the contract they have debarred both themselves and the subsequent incumbrancers from collecting. The instrument being intended solely as a security for money, it could never have been intended by the parties to it, that it should have any such prejudicial effect upon the mortgagees, and the above authorities show that it should not be treated as inoperative. It would therefore appear that the attornment clause and the distress clause must be so read and construed together as to create a tenancy at a fixed rent.\nPhillips on Insurance[18]; See Am. Express Co. v. Pinckney[19]; Harper v. Albany Mutual, &c., Co.[20]; Gumm v. Tyrie[21].\nThe mortgage in the present case conforms to the Statutory Short Form of Mortgages throughout, with the addition, however, of some further clauses, one of which is the attornment clause. If this latter clause should be thought to conflict with any of the clauses contained in the statutory short form, then upon the authority of the above citations, it should be treated as the governing clause. Moreover, it is stated in the special case, that the mortgagor \u201cremained in actual possession of the said lands and premises under and pursuant to the provisions of the said mortgage from the date thereof until after the directing of the Interpleader issue herein,\u201d and it also appears therefrom that default was made in payment of the mortgage moneys within a few months after the date of the mortgage, while an examination of the mortgage itself will show that the attornment clause contains the only provision under and pursuant to which the mortgagee could remain in possession after default.\nA point is made in the judgment of Patterson, J., also in the judgment of Burton, J., of the fact that in the long form of the statutory distress clause, from which the lastly quoted words are taken, the said words are followed by the clause \u201cas in the case of a demise,\u201d and it is argued from this that it is indicated by the lastly mentioned clause that the statutory short form of mortgage does not create the relationship of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and mortgagee. Whether this be a proper deduction or not it has no bearing on the present case, for here there is a demise, or what is equivalent to it, an attornment by the tenant. All that is here required is to show that there is a fixed rent.\nIt was also objected in the court below that the various statutory clauses relating to possession contained in the mortgage in question are inconsistent one with another, and inconsistent with the attornment clause. I submit, in case of any such inconsistency, the attornment clause should prevail. It is not necessary for the appellants to show the the exact nature of the tenancy under which the mortgagor held; it is sufficient if they show that there was a tenancy of any kind and that it was at a fixed rent. That there was a tenancy of some kind is sufficiently shown by the special case when it is admitted that the mortgagor \u201cremained in actual possession of the said lands under and pursuant to the provisions of the said mortgage from the date thereof until after the directing of the interpleader issue herein.\u201d Mr. Kerr, Q.C., and Mr. Wilkes for respondents:\nThe appellants in the case make their claim under the provisions of the statute of 8 Anne, ch. 14, sec. 1, and in order to succeed they must show: 1st. That the relation of landlord and tenant was created; 2nd. That there was a fixed rent; and 3rd, that the rent was fair and reasonable.\nThe mortgage is made in pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of mortgages[22], and the clause upon which appellants rely is what they allege to be the attornment clause. That clause does not refer to any rent, and if the intention of the parties had been that the interest should be the rent, it would be likely that the words \u201cat the rent fixed by this provision\" would have been added. That clause gives only the right to take possession of the land, and the distress clause in the mortgage in question is a mere license to the mortgagees to distrain the goods of the mortgagor for arrears of interest. The ground which the Court of Appeal took was, that if effect was given to this clause as creating the relation of landlord and tenant at a fixed rent, then it would be holding that the intention of the parties was to confer and secure a remedy against the goods of a stranger that might happen to be on the premises. If such had been the intention of the parties, would the mortgagees have allowed three years of interest to accrue; for the mortgage was given in 1877, and it was not until after the seizure by a judgment creditor, that the present appellants moved in the matter.\nThe mortgage in this case was given and accepted as a security for moneys lent on the security of the lands mortgaged, and the courts have always required any extraordinary right that may be reserved to the mort- gagee to be such as is a fair and reasonable one, having regard to the nature of the security.\nIt has been considered right that a mortgagee should have the same security for his debt when the mortgagor is in possession as he would have if the mortgagor\u2019s tenant or a stranger was in possession, the mortgagee being entitled, on default of payment of interest, to demand and recover from the tenant or stranger the rent which would otherwise be paid to the mortgagor, who was entitled to the possession of the premises until default should be made in payment of the mortgage. The clause of attornment of the mortgagor to the mortgagees was then devised, and has been very extensively used, and this was done because it was conceded that the proviso allowing the mortgagees to distrain for arrears of interest amounted to nothing more than a license to seize, and it has been well decided, it is submitted, that the term in the intended form of the covenant that the mortgagees may distrain, and by distress warrant recover, by way of rent reserved, as in case of a demise of lands, the interest due, together with the costs attending such distress as in like case of distress for rent, means no more than that the like proceedings may be taken to recover the interest as may be taken when a distress is made for rent. This proviso, as appears from the language used in the short form, is only intended to give the right to distrain for arrears of interest and not rent; and it is submitted that if any other construction is put upon this proviso, it will become repugnant to the other terms of the ordinary mortgage (apart from the attornment clause), all of which show that the essential matters provided for are payment of the principal money secured thereby, with interest thereon.\nThere is no demise of the premises by the mortgagees contained in this proviso, nor is there any agreement that on default a tenancy shall be created, and that the interest shall then become rent, nor is it alleged that there is any interest in arrear.\nThe case of Clowes v. Hughes[23], shows that there was no subsisting tenancy here. See also Walker v. Giles[24].\nMoreover, there is an inconsistency and repugnancy in the clauses of the said mortgage; for how can the tenancy at will be reconciled with the provision that in default of payment for two calendar months the mortgagees may, on one calendar month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the said land?\nUnder the attornment clause, the mortgagee is entitled, if at all, to the rental of the lands mentioned in the mortgage from its date, while under the other clause just referred to, the mortgagor, being entitled to quiet possession until default, the mortgagee cannot enter on and lease the said lands, in order that he may receive the rents and profits of the said lands, until there is default of payment for two months, and then only on giving one month\u2019s notice. The mortgagee, therefore, could not enter at will, as he would have the right to do if a tenancy at will was created.\nIf the mortgagor abandoned possession of the lands and default was made, the mortgagee could not obtain possession thereof and make a lease until after two months\u2019 default and one month\u2019s notice had been given. But if the attornment clause in the mortgage in question is held to be a valid one, the mortgagee would be entitled at any time to give notice of the termination of the tenancy at will and take possession. The attornment clause cannot be construed to confer two such: distinct rights inconsistent with each other.\nMy learned friends have relied on the case of the Royal Canadian Bank v. Kelly[25], but the judgment of the Court of Error and Appeal; in that case, reversed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas that the statutory distress clause in a mortgage, under the Short Forms Act, creates the relationship of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and the mortgagee.\nThen it is contended that the proviso as to distraining for interest applies and aids the attornment clause as before mentioned. This distressing clause cannot be held to be \u201cthe said proviso\u201d mentioned in the attornment clause. This attornment clause, however, contains no allusion to rent, and by itself it could give no power to distrain. It is an excrescence upon, not an integral portion of the mortgage, and there is no portion of the distress clause, either in its short or extended form, that gives the right to distrain for any rent.\nAnother reason why appellants cannot succeed is, that by the terms of the mortgage, upon default of payment of interest the principal became due, and default was made on the twenty\u2011third day of March, 1877, as the interest was payable in advance and the mortgage money became wholly due and payable prior to the said seizure, and the mortgagor still remaining in possession could not be a tenant, but was a trespasser, and the interest was assessable as damages only.\nFinally, we submit that it is against public policy that any such power as is claimed in this case should be given to mortgagees. Such a power is in direct contravention of the Chattel Mortgage Act, and if allowed would seriously impair the usefulness of that Act.\nMr. Marsh, in reply, relied on Morton v. Woods[26]; Re Threlfell[27]; Pinhorn v. Souster[28]; Brown v. Metropolitan Counties, &c., Society[29]; Turner v. Barnes[30]. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nWhatever may be the effect of the distress clause standing alone, upon which there appears to hare been a difference of judicial opinion, I think there can be no doubt as to the construction and effect of the attornment clause and the distress clause in the same instrument. In construing these two clauses, we must take into consideration the whole scope and object of the instrument, and not regard the position of the clauses; because, as James, L.J., says in ex parte National Guardian Assurance Co. in re Francis[31]:\nThere is no magic in the position of the clauses in the deed, every clause is part and parcel of the bargain between the parties.\nIt is said in Mill v. Hill[32]:\nThe general rule of construction is that the courts, in construing the deeds of parties, look much more to the intent to be collected from the whole deed than from the language of any particular portion of it. The intent must be collected from the deed itself, and not from evidence aliunde; and the courts consider themselves authorized and bound, where they can collect the intent from the language of the deed, if all the parts of the deed will admit of it, to construe that deed rather according to the general intent than according to any particular phraseology contained in it.\nAnd with reference to attornment clauses, Jessel, M.R. says In re Stockton Iron Furnace Co.[33]:\nAccording to the course of practice of conveyancers, when the mortgagor is occupying, so that there is no rent receivable to meet the interest on the mortgage debt, it is usual that he should agree to become tenant. There is nothing novel or remarkable in the mortgage. It is in the ordinary form.\nBacon, C.J., in ex parte Jackson, in re Bowes[34], says:\nThe case of In re Stockton Iron Furnace Co.[35] is valuable for the observations which it contains, which traverse the whole ground of these attornment provisions, and no disapprobation is expressed by the judges, either in that case, or even in ex parte Williams[36], of the use of an extensive attornment clause. Attornment clauses are in themselves valid. They can only be impeached, that is to say, the contract between the parties can only be set aside, if you can infer from the facts that there is an attempt to defraud the other creditors of the mortgagor in the event of bankruptcy happening. There is not a particle of evidence in this case which leads me to think that such an intention was present here.\nCotton, L.J.[37]:\nUndoubtedly, a mortgagor and a mortgagee have a right to insert in their mortgage deed a clause making the mortgagor attorn as tenant to the mortgagee, and thus by contract constituting the relation of landlord and tenant between \u201cthe two. Under such circumstances, where it is a real and not a fictitious or sham arrangement, the ordinary consequences of a tenancy follow, and there can be a distress for the rent agreed upon, which will be valid and effectual in the case of bankruptcy. As has been pointed out by Lord Justice Baggallay, this is quite reasonable, for the mortgagee has a right to take possession, and to turn out the mortgagor, whether he is in possession by himself or by his tenant. If the mortgagor is in possession by a tenant, then the rent which that tenant pays comes into the hands of the mortgagee. If the property is in the possession of the mortgagor himself, the mortgagee may turn him out and let the property, either to a stranger or to the mortgagor; and, therefore, there is nothing unreasonable, or that can be called a fraud on the law of bankruptcy, in allowing the parties to make a contract in the mortgage deed which they might validly and effectually make afterwards. If the mortgagee lets to a third party, no question can arise as to the amount of rent; and if the attornment clause is one which really constitutes the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and mortgagee, the court will not be nice in considering whether the rent is too great for the mortgaged property.\nThesiger, L.J.[38]:\nThere can be no doubt that such clauses contained in the mortgage deeds are valid and operative in themselves, and that they may, and ordinarily do, create the relationship of tenant and landlord between the mortgagor and mortgagee, and with it the ordinary right of distress which the law attaches to that relationship. And, more than that, it appears to me abundantly clear, both upon principle and authority, that attornment clauses will be valid and operative, although the rent reserved by them may be considerably in excess of what may be required to keep down the interest on the mortgage debt. I can even imagine a case in which the rent reserved may be sufficient to pay both principal and interest. But, while that is so, it must also be admitted that the object of attornment clauses is, while giving an additional security to the mortgagee, to place him, as regards the mortgagor who is left in possession of the property, and, in the matter of rent, in the same position in which he would have been if the mortgaged premises had been underlease to a third party.\nNow what was the intent of the parties in reference to this deed? Clearly their sole object was to secure to the mortgagor the repayment of the mortgage money and interest. The clauses in the deed, more especially those we are now considering, were unquestionably inserted with a view to that end in the interest of, and for the benefit and protection of the mortgagee. If it was intended that the right to distrain was merely a collateral license, assuming the distress clause gave no more than a license, to which the right to distrain the goods of a stranger on the premises would not be incident, nor would the right to claim a year\u2019s rent, under the statute of Anne, when the goods are seized by the sheriff, what possible object could there have been in the interest of either party in inserting the attornment clause. If the attornment does not establish the relation of landlord and tenant, it is meaningless. If it establishes the relation of landlord and tenant, but without the reservation of a fixed rent, and is to be read as separate and distinct from the distress clause, then instead of operating in the interest of the mortgagee, and in furtherance of his security, it would impose on him a most onerous burthen, and cast on him a duty of a character having the exact contrary effect, viz.: by making him a landlord it would constitute him a mortgagee in possession with all the corresponding liabilities attaching to that position, and more particularly in regard to any subsequent incumbrances, without conferring on him any other or greater rights or privileges than he would have without the insertion of such a clause, a state of things not benefiting but detracting from the security, a state of things not indicated by the deed, and which, I think, neither party could have contemplated or intended, and which will be avoided by giving legitimate effect to all the clauses of the instrument.\nBy reading these two clauses together as creating a tenancy at a fixed rent, distrainable as between landlord and tenant, the clauses are consistent the one with the other, and in accordance with the scope and object of the mortgage security. To read them separately and as having no connection with or bearing on each other is to render them wholly irreconcilable. To say that the mortgagor when he agreed to the insertion in the mortgage of a clause in these words: \u201cAnd the said mortgagor doth release to the company all his claims upon the said lands and doth attorn to and become tenant at will to the company subject to the said proviso,\u201d viz, the proviso for repayment of principal and interest, and, at the same time, inserted the statutory clause that the company might distrain for interest, which, extended by the terms of the statute, reads thus:\nAnd it is further covenanted, declared and agreed by and between the parties to these presents, that if the said mortgagor, his heirs, executors or administrators shall make default in payment of any part of the said interest at any of the days and times hereinbefore limited for the payment thereof, it shall and may be lawful for the said mortgagee, his heirs or assigns, to distrain therefor upon the said lands, tenements; hereditaments and premises or any part thereof, and by distress warrant to recover by way of rent reserved as in the case of a demise of the said lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises so much of such interest as shall from time to time be or remain in arrear and unpaid, together with all costs, charges and expenses attending such levy or distress as in like cases of distress for rent;\nTo say that he did not intend to make himself a tenant under the first clause, and did not intend under the second clause, read in connection with the first, to fix the amount of rent and times of payment as between landlord and tenant, and make the rent so fixed, rent distrainable by way of rent under the tenancy so created as a right of distress incident to a tenancy, is to say, it appears to me, that the instrument is incapable of a reasonable and consistent construction. I think the only possible object the parties could have had in inserting the attornment clause was to make the interest, when in arrears, rent, and give the landlord the same right, as if in so many words, the attornment clause had specified that the mortgagor became tenant at a fixed rent, viz: the amount of the interest in arrears reserved by the mortgage. Any allusion to rent in the attornment clause was rendered unnecessary, because the rent is fixed by the distress clause, which authorizes the interest to be distrained by way of rent reserved. Those clauses, as I said before, being read together, establish the relation of landlord and tenant, and in my opinion fix the amount of interest as rent for the purposes of the tenancy; or in other words, that the reason why the attornment clause was inserted was to prevent any doubt arising as to the right to distrain being treated under the distress clause as a mere leave and license, and not as a rent charge.\nIn delivering judgment on the appeal in Morton v. Woods,[39] Lord Chief Baron Kelly, after noticing the appellant\u2019s contention that there were certain defects in the form of the mortgage instrument there under consideration which rendered it invalid as a lease, says:\nIt might be so in the ordinary case of a lease; but in order to ascertain whether such a rule of construction has any application to the present instrument, we must take into consideration the whole scope and object of it. And when we find the main, and indeed only object of the deed is a mortgage, and that the creation of a tenancy and the relation of landlord and tenant with a reservation of rent are intended as a mere security for the repayment of the mortgage money and interest, the authority cited is no longer applicable; and we must look at the whole instrument taken together in order to ascertain the intention of the parties.\nand I agree that if the mortgage in question herein be construed according to the rule enunciated in Morton v. Woods, there can be no reasonable doubt that the relationship of landlord and tenant at a fixed rent was thereby created.\nTherefore, in my opinion, the occupation by the mortgagor, connected with the attornment clause and the provision that the mortgagee should have the power of distress for the interest in arrears by way of rent reserved, constituted the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and mortgagee, whereby the mortgagor became tenant at will to the mortgagee, at a fixed rent, viz: the amount of the interest payable at fixed times, and that under such demise, on default in payment of the interest, it became payable qua rent and liable to be distrained for as rent, the right to distrain not being a mere collateral license but a right of distress incident to a tenancy.\nAs the addition of the attornment clauses distinguishes this case from the Royal Canadian Bank v. Kelly[40], and makes whatever may be doubtful in that case clear in this, I refrain from discussing or expressing any opinion on the point there decided that without the attornment clause, the statutory distress clause has the same effect, as I think the two have in this case.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI am of opinion that we ought to dismiss this appeal. I entirely agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that, upon the proper construction of the mortgage deed, there is no reservation of rent. Nothing is said about rent in what is called the \u201cattornment\u201d clause, and, assuming, as I do for the present purpose, that either by the effect of this attornment clause, or by the operation of the covenant, that the mortgagor should \u201c retain possession until default, or by the combined effect of these two provisions, a tenancy of some kind was created there is no pretence for saying that there was, either by expression or implication, any reservation of rent as incident to that tenancy, unless it was contained in the distress clause. What we have to do, then, is to construe the extended statutory equivalent of the short form of proviso actually used by the parties in the mortgage deed itself. And here, I would observe, that the present case affords a very good example of the imprudence of using these short forms, which, in England, as I find it stated in writers of authority, are never adopted. The short form in the mortgage is:\nProvided that the company may distrain for arrears of interest.\nThere is no indication in these words of any intent to reserve a rent. If, therefore, we read the proviso, of which this short form is the symbol, as containing a reservation of rent, we are giving an effect to it which makes the use of this statutory form a share. If the statute had enacted in so many words that interest should mean rent, of course there would be an end of the matter; but, whilst it stops short of that, and so long as there is any ambiguity in the words of the enlarged covenant (though I am far from admitting that there is any ambiguity in the extended form here), I think we ought so to construe the extended form as to ascribe to it a meaning of which the short form may be said to be a fair general expression, and this we certainly should not be doing if we were, by the aid of the statute, to translate the word \u201cinterest\u201d as meaning or including rent. I do not, however, consider this as a conclusive reason, though, in my estimation, it certainly greatly strengthens the construction placed upon the extended form by the majority of the court below. Again, the very existence of an express clause of distress which would be totally unnecessary to entitle the mortgagee to distrain for rent, though not conclusive, is also a circumstance weighing against the construction contended for by the appellants. But I rest my judgment upon what appears to me, speaking with all respect for those who entertain different opinions, to be the plain meaning and intendment of the words of the proviso, taken in its extended form as given in the schedule to the statute, and which is as follows:\u2014\nIf the said mortgagor, his heirs, executors or administrators, shall make default in payment of any of the said interest, at any of the days and times heretofore limited for the payment thereof, it shall and may be lawful for the said mortgagee, his heirs or assigns, to distrain therefor upon the said lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises, or any part thereof, and by distress warrant to recover by way of rent reserved (as in case of a demise) of the said lands, tenements, hereditaments, and premises, so much of such interest as shall from time to time be, or remain in arrear and unpaid, together with all costs, charges and expenses attending such levy or distress, as in like case of distress for rent.\nReading this form, it is apparent at once that all depends upon what is to be considered as meant by the words \u201cto recover by way of rent reserved as in case of a demise of the said lands * * * so much of said interest,\u201d &c.\nNow, in the first place, it is to be observed that what is to be recovered by the distress, is not rent but interest eo nomine; what warrant is there then for saying that this arrear of interest is to be considered as rent reserved? The only answer which can be suggested is, that the words \u201cby way of rent reserved\u201d show that the interest is, so soon as it gets into arrear, to be considered as a reserved rent; but this is to beg the whole question for the words by way of rent reserved are not used in connection with the interest, but with the mode of recovering it; it is not said that interest in arrear is to be considered as rent reserved, but that when interest in arrear is to be recovered, it is to be so recovered in the same way that rent reserved on a demise is to be recovered, namely, by distress. And the latter words of the clause, providing that the costs of the distress shall be recovered \u201cas in like case of distress for rent,\u201d reflect light on the preceding expressions, and show, as clearly as language can express it, that the distress is not to be for rent, but for interest to be recovered in the same way as rent.\nThe case of Doe Wilkinson v. Goodier[41] is an authority amply sufficient to warrant this construction. In that case, the power of distress authorized the mortgagee to distrain for interest in arrear for twenty-one days \u201cin like manner as for rent reserved on a lease;\u201d and the court held that this did not amount to a reservation of rent, but was a mere personal clause of distress. I am unable to see any difference sufficient to make a reasonable distinction between the concluding words of the clause in question here, and which, as I have said, are a key to the construction of the expressions used in the earlier part of the proviso, \u201cas in like case of distress for rent;\u201d and the words in Doe Wilkinson v. Goodier, \u201cin like manner as for rent reserved on a lease.\u201d I am, therefore, of opinion, that for the reasons given by the majority of the Court of Appeal\u2014reasons to which I profess to add nothing, but merely to reiterate them in my own language\u2014this appeal should be dismissed.\nI have arrived at this conclusion, as already indicated, merely by a process of verbal construction, and without being influenced by any considerations of the impolicy or hardship of giving effect to the provision in question as amounting to a reservation of rent.\nAs I was a party to the decision in the case of the Royal Canadian Bank v. Kelly, in the Court of Appeal, I think it proper to say that I have given no weight to that decision as an authority in the present question; for this the want of any authentic report of the case would alone be a sufficient reason, but besides this, my recollection of that case is such that I could not properly act upon it. In Kelly v. Royal Canadian Bank there was not, as there is here, an express provision in the mortgage deed that the mortgagor should become tenant at will to the mortgagee\u2014in other words, there was no attornment clause\u2014the only clause contained in the deed from which a tenancy could be implied was the provision that the mortgagor should have quiet possession until default, and I am able to say that the grounds of my own judgment, which concurred with those stated by the Chief Justice, was that there was no tenancy to which a rent (as a rent service) could be incident, since the covenant that the mortgagor should have possession until default in payment\u2014in a case where the principal and interest were payable not at one fixed date but by instalments\u2014wanted that certainty which is requisite for the creation of a term. The judgment of the court in that case was the judgment of a large majority, but a majority which did not agree in the reasons assigned for their judgments, for whilst the judgments of some of the learned judges proceeded upon the grounds I have just mentioned those of others proceeded upon the ground upon which the Court of Appeal have rested their decision in this case, the proper construction of the clause of distress in the extended form given in the statute. This want of unanimity was probably the reason why the judgment was witheld from the reporter. I only mention it now as explaining why I attributed no weight to it in arriving at a decision of the present appeal.\nAlthough I rest my judgment in the present case entirely on the same grounds as those relied on by Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Patterson, in the Court of Appeal, I think it right to point out some further grounds for the conclusion that, notwithstanding the existence of the attornment clause in this mortgage deed, no tenancy to which a rent service could have been incident, was created. This attornment clause appears to be so utterly inconsistent with the proviso, that the mortgagor should have quiet possession until default, that the one or the other of these clauses must be void for repugnancy. The mortgage deed, operating as a conveyance to the mortgagee of the whole fee, these provisions are in the nature of redemises to the mortgagor, and, therefore, must be construed beneficially to the mortgagor, and strictly against the mortgagee, who is in the position of a grantor as regards them. Then it being impossible to reconcile a tenancy at will, that is, a tenancy determinable at the will of the mortgagee, under which the latter can, at any time, take possession, with a provision, though in form but a mere personal covenant, that the mortgagor shall remain in quiet possession until default in payment; one or the other of these two clauses must necessarily give way, and upon the principle of construction just stated, it is clear that this must be the attornment clause being less beneficial to the mortgagor. It is no answer to this argument to say that the tenancy at will can subsist with the collateral personal covenant of the mortgagee not to take possession until default, for such a covenant would be enforced specifically by a court of equity, which would restrain the mortgagee from taking possession in violation of its terms, and thus there would arise a direct repugnancy between such a provision and a tenancy at will. Then, in determining whether a tenancy is created or not, and what is the nature of the tenancy we must have regard at law as well as in equity to the terms of the whole deed, for to this extent at least the case of Walker v. Giles[42], though impugned in other respects, is still law, and is so recognized in the later cases of Pinhorn v. Souster[43], and Brown v. The Metropoliton Counties, &c., Society[44] That this is the effect of the authorities is also recognized in Davidson\u2019s Conveyancing[45], and in the 3rd edition of Fisher on Mortgages[46] the true principle to be extracted from the authorities is thus stated:\u2014\nAlthough a tenancy may be created by insufficient words in the deed it will not be allowed where the effect would be inconsistent with the general object of the deed.\nThen, the tenancy at will created by express words in the attornment clause being thus rejected we have only to deal with the provision that the mortgagor shall hold until default in payment of principal or interest at the times stipulated in the deed; if any tenancy is created it must be by that clause. Now, when I say that this clause is in the nature of a redemise, I do not mean to say that it creates a strict legal tenancy, that it confers upon the mortgagor a chattel interest amounting to a legal term, for it has been determined\u2014and upon long established principles of the law relating to leases and terms for years, it could not be otherwise held\u2014that the uncertainty in the duration of the term is fatal to such a construction, though, as I have before said, the covenant is one which a court of equity would undoubtedly enforce by restraining the mortgagee from ejecting the mortgagor before default. In the view which I thus take of the proper construction of the mortgage deed, after eliminating, for the reasons already stated, the clause purporting to create the tenancy at will, there is neither a tenancy created by the remaining provisions of the deed nor anything amounting to a reservation of rent.\nThe uncertain duration of the holding until default in any one of the half-yearly payments of interest during a period of five years, and then until default in the payment of the principal at the end of that time, makes the implication of a tenancy, in view of the requisites for the creation of a legal term, in my opinion, impossible.\nThere are, it is true, some decisions which may seem contradictory on this point, and Wilkinson v. Hall[47] is supposed to have determined otherwise. I think, however, that case is sufficiently distinguished from the present in the full and able discussion of the authorities contained in the note to Keech v. Hall in Smith\u2019s Leading Oases[48]. This distinction is that in Wilkinson v. Hall the mortgagor was to remain in possession until default made in the payment of the mortgage money at one certain time fixed by the deed\u2014not as here, until default should be made in any one of a number of half-yearly payments spread over a series of years. In a case\u2014such as that of Wilkinson v. Hall\u2014all the money, principal and interest together, being payable at a day certain, the duration of the term was fixed and ascertained as soon as the deed was executed to be until the one certain day named for payment. In a deed framed like the present, it is, however, impossible to say what the duration of a right of possession will be, which is dependent altogether on ex post facto events\u2014in the present case ten different contingencies. Therefore, for the reason that it wants that prefixed certainty which is essential to the creation of a term, I should be inclined to hold\u2014if the point had to be decided\u2014that the quiet possession clause in the present case does not create a legal tenancy. The editors of Smith\u2019s Leading cases state the following as a general conclusion from the authorities[49]:\nIt may, perhaps, be concluded in this review of the authorities that in order to make a redemise there must be an affirmative covenant that the mortgagor shall hold for a determinate time and that where either of these elements is wanting there is no re\u2011demise.\nThe mortgage deed in the present case does contain the affirmative covenant that the mortgagor shall hold, but not that he shall hold for a determinate time.\nIt is no answer to this to say \u201cid cerium est quod certum reddi protest\u201d for no principle of the law of property is better established than that which makes it indispensable to the creation of a term that its duration should be prefixed and certain from the beginning, and not fluctuating or uncertain according as certain contingencies may or may not happen.\nWe find it laid down that a lease for so many years as A shall live is void for uncertainty, though nothing can be more certain than that there is a limit to human life, but a lease fox twenty-one years if A shall so long live is good, being a lease for a term certain, determinable on a contingent event which may happen before the expiration of the term limited[50].\nSo in the case of a mortgage where the principal is payable in one sum, at one fixed date, and the interest is made payable in a number of half yearly payments, as in the present case, if the covenant should be that the mortgagor should have quiet possession until the time fixed for payment of the principal, with a proviso thatsuch right of possession should be determinable upon default in payment of the interest at any of the stipulated times, that, no doubt, would create a perfectly good legal interest in the nature of a term of years. This distinction may be thought very thin and meaningless, but it is well-settled law, and that is sufficient for the present purpose. I have made these observations, not as intending to rest my judgment upon them, but because it occurred to me that it might be useful to draw attention to the difficulty I should have felt, in holding that the quiet possession clause created a tenancy, as a suggestion that this clause, in mortgage deeds, should be so framed as to avoid the objection, as may easily be done.\nAs to the point that the quiet possession clause could, in no case, operate, because the mortgage was not executed by the mortgagees, I am clearly of opinion that, even as a strict legal objection, it is of no force, since the principle is, that a mortgagee or grantee is bound, even at law, to sustain the burden of covenants and provisions contained in a deed under which he claims to take a benefit, even though he has not executed the instrument[51], and, at all events, a court of equity would, on the ground of equitable fraud, restrain a party to a deed in such a position from repudiating any obligation or onerous provisions which the instrument imposed upon him.\nIt was suggested, that, although no tenancy was created to which a rent, as a rent service, could be incident, the distress clause might be construed as creating a rent charge. This point is sufficiently answered by the view which\u2014following the Court of Appeal\u2014I have taken of the proper construction and meaning of the clause in question a further and conclusive reason being that the mortgagor had no legal estate out of which such a rent charge could issue. My Conclusion is, that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with STRONG, J.\nHENRY, J.:\nI agree with my brother Strong, and entirely adopt the views of Mr. Justice Patterson and Mr. Justice Burton. I have come to the conclusion that the attornment was not to attorn further than to give a license to distrain which would enable the mortgagees to collect arrears of interest and did not create the relation of landlord and tenant so as to enable them to distrain strangers\u2019 property found on the premises.\nTASCHEREAU, J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nAt the time of the passing of the 27th and 28th Vic., ch. 31, it was the universal practice, I may say, in the Province of Upper Canada for mortgagees to insist, as a condition of all loans on mortgage, upon a clause being inserted in the mortgage whereby in express terms the mortgagor become tenant to the mortgagee at a rent which was the interest agreed upon for the principal sum secured by the mortgage, and the object of the act was simply, in my opinion, as its title indicates, to establish a short form, which could conveniently and at a trifling expense be registered in full. That the relation of landlord and tenant can subsist between a mortgagee and his mortgagor simultaneously with, and by virtue of the same instrument as creates the relationship of mortgagee and mortgagor, is not disputed. If then, the language of the short form given by the statute is sufficient to create the relationship of landlord and tenant at a rent, I cannot see upon what principle we should construe that language as conferring a mere license to distrain the goods of the mortgagor himself alone, and so deprive the mortgagee of the security which(upon the faith of the language of the statute being sufficient for the purpose), may have been an essential condition without which he would not have consented to lend his money; and I cannot see how a mortgagee\u2019s insisting upon his having the security, which a mortgagor becoming tenant of the mortgagee for the mortgaged premises gives to the latter, can be regarded as in fraud of the Chattel Mortgage Act. Now, the language of the statute when expanded as it is in column two of the Act is:\nAnd it is further covenanted, declared, and agreed by and between the parties to these presents, that if the said mortgagor, his heirs, executors, or administrators shall make default in payment of any part of the said interest at any of the days and times hereinbefore limited for the payment thereof, it shall and may be lawful for the said mortgagee, his heirs or assigns to distrain therefor upon the said lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises or any part thereof, and by distress warrant to recover by way of rent reserved as in the case of a demise of the said lauds, tenements, hereditaments and premises so much of such interest as shall from time to time be and remain in arrear and unpaid, together with all costs, charges and expenses attending such levy or distress as in like cases of distress for rent.\nNow this language is, to my mind, essentially different from the language used in Chapman v. Beecham[52]; Doe Wilkinson v. Goodier[53]; and Pollitt v. Forrest[54]. The covenant is not that the mortgagee may distrain for the interest \u201cin like manner as landlords are authorized to do in respect of distress for arrears of rent upon leases for years;\u201d nor \u201cin like manner as for rent reserved by lease;\u201d nor does the covenant impose a penalty for which the mortgagee may distrain \u201cas for rent in arrear\u201d as in Pollitt v. Forrest, but it is that the mortgagee may distrain upon the lands and for the interest, and recover it by way of rent reserved as in the case of a demise, thus, as it appears to me, plainly declaring that the interest shall be deemed to be rent reserved and recoverable as such. But it is said that the introduction into the clause of the words \u201cas in the case of a demise of the said lands, &c.,\u201d is quite inconsistent with the relationship of landlord and tenant being created; but on the contrary, the language appears to me to be sufficiently appropriate to the object in view, which was not to create an indenture of demise merely, which the legislature knew to be an instrument which in its terms is different from an indenture of mortgage, but in an indenture of mortgage to attach the relationship of landlord and tenant to that of mortgagee and mortgagor, with all the incidents of the former relationship as in the case of a demise\u2014just as if the parties should have said that although this is an indenture of mortgage, and the parties to it are called mortgagee and mortgagor, the relationship of landlord and tenant shall also exist between the parties, and the interest payable by the mortgagor shall be paid to and recoverable by the mortgagee by way of rent reserved upon the indenture of mortgage, just as in the case of a pure indenture of demise. The language of the statute appears, to my mind, to be abundantly sufficient to superadd the relationship of landlord and tenant to that of mortgagee and mortgagor, upon the authority of West v. Fritche[55]; Doe Dixie v. Davies[56]; Tinhorn v. Souster[57]; Doe Bastow v. Cox[58]; Brown v. Metropolitan Counties, &c., Society[59]; Morton v. Woods[60]; and being sufficient for that purpose I do not think that we should be justified in diminishing its force. However to a clause which, to my mind, is in itself sufficient, the parties to the mortgage before us, to make assurance doubly sure, have introduced a further clause whereby the mortgagor in express terms attorns to, and becomes tenant at will to the mortgagee, subject to the proviso for redemption contained in the mortgage. I am unable to see how we can declare that the relationship of landlord and tenant, with all its incidents, does not exist without declaring that the plainly expressed intention of the parties shall not prevail. The appeal therefore must, in my opinion, be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench be restored.\nAppeal dismissed without costs,\nSolicitors for appellants: Macdonald, Macdonald and Marsh.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hardy, Wilkes, Jones and D.

By the fourth clause he gave the sum of $1,600, without condition, to each of his sons, Alexander and Duncan. By the 5th clause he devised to his sons Douglas and Robert Oliver two lots; and after giving several legacies to his daughters, he proceeded, \u201cand further, that Alexander and Duncan work on the farm until their legacies become due.\u201d Alexander left the farm in 1871, and entered into mercantile pursuits.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Ritchie, C.J., and Henry, J., dissenting, that the direction that Alexander should work on the farm was a condition precedent to his right to the legacy of $1,600.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the decree of Proudfoot, V.C. The question which arose on this appeal was whether, under the provision of the will of one William Oliver (deceased) a legacy of $1,600, bequeathed to his son Alexander under certain conditions, was payable to the assignee in insolvency of the said Alexander Oliver.\nThe clauses of the will relating to the matter in question are fully set out in the judgments hereinafter given.\nJames Bethune, Q.C., for appellants, and Bruce for respondent.\nThe cases cited and relied on by the counsel are reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIn the introductory clause of the will the testator thus expresses himself:\u2014\nAs it is the wishes of my family, all except my son Daniel Oliver who seems dissatisfied, and it is also my will, that the remainder of my family remain united one and all, as at present, until the mortgage is paid upon my farm in the township of Brantford, and other just debts paid, after said debts and mortgage are paid, the rest and residue of my property I give, devise, and dispose of as follows, that is to say:\u2014\nNo intention is here indicated that should any of the family change their minds and not remain united, any forfeiture was to accrue in consequence. Then we have the bequeathing clauses:\u2014\nI give and bequeath to my son, Daniel Oliver, the sum of $1,200, along with the stock and money he has already received; and to my daughter, Flora Oliver, the sum of $400; also, to my daughter Mary, the sum of $400; and I direct and order the said legacies to be paid to the said legatees in the following manner, viz., to my son Daniel, $600 on or before the 1st January, 1873, and the sum of $600 on or before the 1st January, 1874; to my daughter Flora, $400 on or before the 1st January, 1875; to my daughter Mary, $400 on or before the 1st January, 1876.\nThen by the clause second the testator says:\u2014\n2nd. I give and bequeath unto my two sons, Thomas and William Oliver, my farm in the township of Brantford and county of Brant, Ontario, being composed of Lots 2, 3, 4 and 5, in the Ox Bow Bend of the Grand River, containing by admeasurement 144 61-100 acres, together with all the heriditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, to be equally divided between them, share and share alike, and under the following conditions, viz., that they do pay to my executors thereinafter named, the following sums of money herein described, viz., the sum of $300 each on or before the 1st January, 1873; and the sum of $300 each on or before the 1st January, 1874; also, the sums of $200 each on or before 1st January, 1875; and the sum of $200 each on or before the 1st January, 1876.\nHere we have a bequest on a condition clearly expressed, as we have in the next clause 3:\u2014\n3rd. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, and mixed, of which I shall be seized, possessed, and entitled to at the time of my decease, to my wife Agnes Oliver, and four sons and two daughters namely, Alexander, Duncan, Douglas, Robert, Helen, Agnes Oliver, my property in the township of Onondaga, and county of Brant, consisting of lots 8 and 9 in the third concession, east of Fairchild\u2019s Creek, county of Brant, Ontario, together with all other property above named (except so much of the stock on both farms as shall form one-third of the whole, which I hereby give and bequeath to my sons Thomas and William Oliver, to be equally divided between them), and this bequest shall be made when the mortgage on my farm, on Ox Bow Bend, shall be fully paid, to have and to hold the same for their use from the year 1872, until the youngest child becomes 21 years of age, subject to the following conditions, viz.:\u2014that they unite in paying over to my executors on or before the 1st January, 1877, the sum of $1,600, and also the sum of $1,600 on or before the 1st January, 1882, said sums to pay Alexander and Duncan Oliver\u2019s shares as herein provided for.\nIt may well be contended that the testator intended that the effect of the breach of this condition should exclude any of those who did not so unite from participating in this bequest or devise, but there is nothing whatever, by expression or implication, to indicate any intention that should some or all refuse to unite, the bequests referred to, and subsequently provided for, to Alexander and Duncan, were to lapse or become forfeited. Then comes clause 4, as follows:\u2014\n4th. I give and bequeath to my son Alexander Oliver, the sum of $1,600; to my son Duncan Oliver, the sum of $1,600; to my daughters Helen and Agnes Oliver, the sum of $400 each as herein provided, and I order the said sums to be paid to the respective legatees as follows:\u2014Alexander, on or before 1st January, 1877; to Duncan Oliver, on or before 1st January, 1882.; and to my daughters Helen and Agnes Oliver, on or before 1st January, 1886.\nHere we have a clear, separate, absolute bequest, without qualification, limitation or condition. Seeing that in clauses 2 and 3, where the bequests are intended to be conditional, the conditions are clearly, unequivocally and absolutely expressed, is it not a fair and legitimate inference that in the clauses 1 and 4, where the bequest is in clear and decisive terms without any conditions or qualifications, the testator intended the bequest should stand and be acted on as it is unequivocally and absolutely written. Up to this point in the will, no question can, it appears to me; arise as to these bequests to Alexander and Duncan being without condition.\nThe wish expressed in the preamble, or opening clause of the will, that the family should remain united, had no connection with, or control over, the bequests in either the 1st or the 4th clauses.\nThen comes sec. 5:\n5th. I give and bequeath unto my sons Douglas and Robert Oliver, their heirs and assigns, my two lots of land in the township of Onondaga and county of Brant, composed of lots Nos. 8 and 9, township aforesaid, to be divided as follows: Douglas Oliver to have lot No. 9 and Robert Oliver lot No. 8; Douglas Oliver to pay sister Helen $400 as above provided, and to his sister Agnes the sum of $400 as above provided; and further, that Alexander and Duncan Oliver work on the farm until their legacies become due, and when the youngest child becomes the age of 21 years, Douglas and Robert Oliver each to get possession of his lot specified, and of one-half of the stock and implements which shall be at that time on the said lots, and the other half shall be equally divided between my sons Alexander and Duncan Oliver, yet be it fully understood that I reserve for my wife, Agnes Oliver, the sole use of so much of the dwelling house and furniture situated on lot No. 8, where I now reside, as she may desire so long as she shall remain my widow, an she shall receive the sum of $180 per annum from my son Robert Oliver\nIt is contended that the provision or stipulation that Alexander and Duncan shall work on the farm until their legacies become due, control and over-ride the preceding section, and on they or either of them neglecting to do so, their legacies respectively became void.\nHad the testator so intended, I think the frame and phraseology of the whole will indicate that he would have so expressed it in clause 4 in which the bequest is made, or failing, that he could have done it in this clause 5, and not have left the matter in uncertainty or to inference. It may well be that if Alexander and Duncan neglect or refuse to work on the farm, they will lose all benefit of the bequest in clause 5, which contains the injunction for them to do so, and still the legacy in clause 4 be payable to them. I can discover no language from which it can be clearly and certainly concluded that a non-compliance with a stipulation in clause 5, was intended to work a forfeiture of a bequest in clause 4; the only reference to the bequest in clause 5 being that the times of the payments of the legacies, the dates of which are found in clause 4, are named as the periods until which they should work on the farm. No provision is made in case of a forfeiture for the disposition of these legacies, nor any intention exhibited that the testator intended them to form part of his residuary estate, which he disposes of by clause 3. On the contrary, the bequest of the residuary estate is on the express condition, without limitation or qualification, that they the devisees unite in paying over to the executors, on or before 1st January, 1877, the sum of $1,600, and also the sum of $1,600 on or before the 1st January, 1882, said sums to pay Alexander and Duncan\u2019s shares as herein provided for. Here is a positive and absolute condition which, according to the present contention, is again made conditional on the performance of an alleged condition on the part of Alexander and Duncan. But where do we get any language of the testator\u2019s to indicate that he had any such intention; and we have nothing whatever to show that the testator contemplated dying intestate as to these two sums of $1,600. There is a well established principle of law that, I think, should govern this case.\nIt is a rule of the courts, in construing written instruments, that where an interest is given, or an estate conveyed, in one clause of the instrument in clear and decisive terms, such interest or estate cannot be taken away, or cut down by raising a doubt upon the extent and meaning and application of a subsequent clause, nor by inference therefrom, nor by any subsequent words that are not as clear and decisive as the words of the clause giving that interest or estate. See Biddulph v. Lees[2]; Young v. Turner[3]; Wright v. Wilkins[4]; East v. Twyford[5]; Grey v. Fryer[6]; Key v. Key[7].\nIn Doe Luscombe v. Gates[8] the court says:\u2014\nWe are to consider that this is a proviso introduced to defeat an estate already vested for the breach of a condition subsequent, and is in the nature of a forfeiture, and consequently that the words of it must, according to general rules and principles, be construed strictly, and effect must not be given to it unless the supposed in tention of the testator be expressed in plain and unambiguous language.\nIn River v. Oldfield[9], Per Lord Justice Knight-Bruce:\u2014\nThis will, although singularly penned, clearly gives a fourth part of the property in question to the plaintiffs, or one of them, and this share cannot be taken from them except by language equally clear.\nIn Thornhill v. Hall[10] the Lord Chancellor says[11]:\u2014 I hold it to be a rule that admits of no exception in the construction of written instruments, that where one interest is given, where one estate is conveyed, where one benefit is bestowed in one part of an instrument by terms, clear, unambiguous, liable to no doubt, clouded by no obscurity, by terms upon which, if they stood alone, no man breathing, be he lawyer or be he layman, could entertain a doubt,\u2014in order to reverse that opinion, to which the terms would, of themselves and standing alone, have led, it is not sufficient that you should raise a mist; it is not sufficient that you should create a doubt; it is not sufficient that you should show a possibility; it is not even sufficient that you should deal in probabilities; but you must show something in another part of that instrument which is as decisive the one way as the other terms were decisive the other way; and that the interest first given cannot be taken away either by tacitum or by dubium, or by possibile, or even by probabile, but that it must be taken away, and can only be taken away, by expression et certum.\nIf there ever was a case in which the principles here enumerated should be acted on, I think this is the case. Can it be said that these clear bequests to Alexander and Duncan have been limited by language, or even inferences, equally clear? The court of first instance, presided over by Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, decided that the legacy was not subject to the condition precedent of his working on the farm; three judges out of the four in the Appeal Court of Ontario held the same and even the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal says: \u201cThis will is so inartificially drawn that it can be no matter of surprise to find different views taken of its meaning.\u201d Under all these circumstances, in view of well established principles, I am unable to bring my mind to the conclusion that the judgment should be reversed. It is scarcely necessary to say I agree with all the judges in the courts below, that the evidence fails to establish the agreement referred to in the second of the reasons of appeal in the court below.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIn the view which I take of the proper construction of this will, the direction that the testator\u2019s sons, Alexander Oliver and Duncan Oliver, should work on the Onondaga farm until their legacies became due, constituted a condition precedent to the payment of those legacies. After 1872, when the mortgage on the Brantford farm would be paid off, and until which date the family were directed to remain together, the use of the Onondaga farm is devised to the testator\u2019s widow, and the six children named as residuary legatees, until the youngest child came of age, subject to what the testator calls a condition that all the legatees should unite in providing a fund for the payment of the legacies to Alexander and Duncan. The effect of the words \u201csubject to the following conditions,\u201d and those which follow them at the end of the third clause of the will was, to make the legacies given to Alexander and Duncan charges upon the beneficial interest\u2014an interest in the nature of a term commencing in 1872 and ending upon the youngest child coming of age\u2014given to the widow and six children in the Onondaga farm. That this is the proper construction a moment\u2019s reflection will show, for if land is devised to A upon condition that he pay a sum of money to B, the money so to be paid constitutes a charge, though expressed in the form of a condition. And there is nothing by which we can make any distinction in principle, between the case presented to us by the provision in the 3rd clause of this will, and the more simple form of bequest just put. If there had been nothing more in the will restricting this charge to the actual profits of the land, to be raised by its actual occupation and cultivation as a farm, it would have been one which might have been raised either by the sale or mortgage of the term, or beneficial interest in the nature of a term, which had been devised, or out of the annual rents and profits, either those accruing from a lease or those derived from actual occupation, at the election of the devisees. The subsequent clause of the will, which directs that \u201cAlexander and Duncan work on the farm until their legacies become due,\u201d shows, however, clearly that the enjoyment is to be a personal one, and not an enjoyment of the rents and profits derived from a lease or otherwise; in other words the expression \u201cuse\u201d in the 3rd clause is to be taken in its popular, and not in its technical signification. The effect is the same as if the testator had directed, in terms, that the legacies to Alexander and Duncan should be payable out of profits to be derived from the working and cultivation of the farm; to raise which Alexander and Duncan were to contribute, not only their shares of the use and enjoyment of the farm, but also their labor; whilst the other residuary legatees, i.e., the widow and four other children, were only to contribute their shares in the profits of the farm to be thus raised by the personal services of Alexander and Duncan. This seems to me to make it clear, that it was a condition precedent to the payment of legacies to Alexander and Duncan that they should comply with the direction of the will. If a testator bequeaths a pecuniary legacy, and then directs for its payment the provision of a fund to be formed by the contribution of the legatees to whom the legacy is given as well as others, as, for instance, if a man bequeaths $1,000 each to his widow and six children, and gives a further sum of $1,000 to his widow, and then directs that for the payment of this last legacy a fund should be provided to which all, including the widow herself, should contribute in money payments of equal amount; in such a case it would be out of the question to say that the widow could insist upon the payment of the full amount of the second legacy, and resist any reduction from it in respect of the sum she was directed to contribute to the fund to be provided for its payment. The rights of the parties in this simple case would be administered by merely deducting the amount of the widow\u2019s contribution from the legacy given to her. The principle of construction is the same in the present case, but as the services of the sons were of uncertain value, and inasmuch as by the devotion of their time and labor to the farm the whole amount of the legacies given to them might have been raised without any contribution from the other legatees beyond the relinquishment pro tanto of their use and enjoyment of the profits of the farm, the obligation imposed on Alexander and Duncan could not be dealt with as a charge as in the case of a money payment. The only mode in which effect could be given to the testator\u2019s direction that they should work on the farm, is by treating it as a condition precedent. That they should take the legacy cum onere, was, I am satisfied, by the considerations I have already pointed out, the clear intention of the testator, and I am equally clear that no other mode can be suggested by which the performance of the obligations of personal service so imposed can be ensured, but by treating them as conditions precedent to the payment of the legacy. This being so, all difficulty in thus construing the will is at an end, for, if we do not adopt the construction indicated, we must treat the direction in question as wholly nugatory and ineffectual, and every principle, applicable to the interpretation of wills, forbids us to do this.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and the decree of the Court of Chancery, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming it, must be reversed with costs to the appellants in both of those courts.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nIn this case I agree with the view taken by Mr. Jus- tice Patterson in the court below, and am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nUnder the pleadings in this case the decision of the issue depends upon the construction of the will of William Oliver, late of the township of Onondaga in the county of Brant and province of Ontario, farmer, deceased.\nThe respondent is the assignee of the estate and effects of Alexander Oliver and Douglas Oliver, sons of the testator, to whom bequests are made in the will. The question before us is as to the bequest to Alexander Davidson of $1,600, as made in the fourth clause of the will, which provides that the legacy should be paid to him on or before the 1st January, 1877.\nThe words of the bequest are \u201cI give and bequeath to my son Alexander Oliver the sum of $1,600.\u201d It is, therefore, wholly unconditional so far as contained in that clause. There are, however, other provisions and directions in the will, by which it is claimed that the bequest was intended to be, and is, conditional. In the first part of his will the testator says:\u2014\nAs it is the wishes of my family, all except my son Daniel, who seems dissatisfied, and it is also my will, that the remainder of my family remain united one and all, as at present, until the mortgage is paid upon my farm in the township of Brantford, and other just debts paid; after said debts and mortgage are paid, the rest and residue of my property I give, devise and dispose of as follows:\u2014lst. I give devise and bequeath to my son, Daniel Oliver, the sum of $1,200 along with the stock and money he has already received.\nHe then gives and bequeaths to two of his daughters $100 each, and directed when the legacies were to be paid.\nIn the second clause of his will the testator bequeaths to his two sons, Thomas and William Oliver, a farm in the township of Brantford, but on condition of their paying to his executors two thousand dollars by certain instalments therein mentioned.\nHe then in the third clause gives, devises and bequeaths:\u2014\nAll the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal and mixed, of which I shall be seized and entitled to at the time of my decease, to my wife Agnes Oliver and four sons and two daughters, namely, Alexander, Duncan, Douglas, Robert, Helen and Agnes Oliver, my property in the township of Onondaga and county of Brant, consisting of lots 8 and 9 in the Third Concession, east of Fairchild\u2019s Creek, county of Brant, Ontario, together with all other property above named, (except so much of the stock on both farms as shall form one-third of the whole, which I hereby give and bequeath to my sons Thomas and William Oliver, to be equally divided between them). And this bequest shall be made when the Mortagage on my farm on Ox Bow Bend shall be fully paid; to have and to hold the same for their own use from the year 1872 until the youngest child becomes 21 years of age, subject to the following conditions, viz., that they unite in paying to my executors on or before the 1st January, 1877, the sum of $1,600, and, also, the sum of $1,600 on or before the 1st January, 1882, said sums to pay Alexander and Duncan Oliver\u2019s shares as herein provided for.\nIn the 5th clause of his will he bequeaths to his two sons, Douglas and Robert Oliver, the two lots 8 and 9 previously bequeathed in the 3rd clause\u2014Douglas to pay his sister Helen $400 and his sister Agnes $400 \u201cas above provided.\u201d \u201cAnd further, that Alexander and Duncan Oliver work on the farm until their legacies become due.\u201d The clause then provides that \u201cwhen the youngest child (Robert) becomes the age of 21 years, Douglas and Robert each to get possession of his lot specified, &c.\u201d\nThe question then is: Do the words which direct that Alexander and Duncan should work on the farm until their respective legacies should fall due, avoid the bequest to Alexander, he having failed to work on the farm as that part of the clause provides? No part of the will so provides in express terms, and we are, there- fore, to ascertain from the whole will whether or not that was the testator\u2019s intention. That intention must be found from strong language that should have no reasonable doubt.\nThe bequest to Alexander in the 4th clause of the will is absolute, and subject to no condition whatever. We must therefore, from some other part of it find, that although so made, a condition was annexed. We are not allowed to speculate as to it where the words relied upon are in themselves doubtful. The testator has spoken plainly in the 4th clause. His intention is clear and unmistakeable, and unless we find it equally clear that he intended to annex a condition, we are, I think, bound to sustain the bequest as unconditional.\nIn Clavering v. Ellison[12] the Vice-Chancellor says:\nNow, with regard to contingent limitations or conditions, which are to have the effect of defeating a vested estate, it is a plain rule that such limitations must be construed strictly. That rule is of very old standing.\nAnd again:\u2014\nIf such be a clear rule, it appears to me to be an equally clear principle that the contingency on which such a limitation is to take effect should be something definite and certain; that the contingency should be so expressed as not to leave it in any degree doubtful or uncertain what the contingency is which is intended to defeat the prior estate.\nIn River v. Oldfield[13] Lord Justice Knight-Bruce, in giving judgment, says:\u2014\nThis will, although singularly penned, gives a fourth part of the property in question to the plaintiffs, or one of them, and this share cannot be taken from them except by language equally clear.\nIn Thornhill and others v. Hall[14], Lord Chancellor Brougham, when giving judgment in the House of Lords, said: [His Lordship read the extract][15].\nI think this clearly applies to the case before us. I hold that the moment a doubt is raised, the previous absolute bequest should be adjudged as uncontrolled by any thing subsequent. In a subsequent part of the same judgment his lordship said:\nHere is that which may apply to either; here is that which is doubtful; here is that which is not of necessity, or by necessary implication to be held to cover Robert\u2019s interest, and you are called upon, in the face of a devise clearly giving to Robert an absolute interest, to elect between two possibilities to convert what is doubtful into a certainty, and to convert that which is absolutely certain into absolute dubium or something the very reverse of certainty.\nIn view of the principles of construction adopted in the several judgments I have quoted from, and many others I might have referred to, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the will in this case to show that the testator would have declined to make the bequest to Alexander unless on the condition contended for. In the first part of his will he states the fact of his son Daniel being dissatisfied and declining to remain united with the rest of the family, but he nevertheless bequeaths him $1,200 in addition to stock and money he had previously received as advancement, in all probability a bequest much larger than that to Alexander. The latter, at his father\u2019s death, was but seventeen years old, and while thus dealing liberally with Daniel, his elder brother, are we necessarily to conclude that he would have cut Alexander entirely off from any participation in his estate had he, like Daniel, been dissatisfied and declined to remain. On the contrary I think we should conclude, in the absence of anything shown to the contrary, that he would have made no distinction between the two brothers. The testator, however, shows by the particular words used, that the idea of the family remaining united did not originate with him. \u201cAs it is the wishes of my family, all except my son Daniel,\u201d &c., \u201cand as it is my will,\u201d &c. These expressions would lead to the conclusion that as it was their wish to do so, he would make the necessary provision for their doing so, independently of any particular desire on his own part. If that be the proper construction of the language referred to, it would go very far to negative the proposition that the subsequent provision that Alexander and Duncan should work on the farm until their legacies became due, was intended as a condition upon which they were entitled to the legacies made to them. As I, however, consider the rule of construction to be as I before stated it, there is no occasion, in my opinion, to resort to the view I have just given. According to the construction contended for by the appellants, if Alexander had worked on the farm for the whole period up to a week or a few days before his legacy fell due, and then left, such leaving would be the means of forfeiting the whole of it. To adjudge such a result, we should have such an intention on the part of testator stated in the most unequivocal terms, and we would not be justified while a doubt remained, but must be satisfied that the language of the will necessarily called for such a decision. It will be observed that the testator in the fifth clause makes use of no words such as \u201cI direct,\u201d \u201cI order,\u201d or \u201cIt is my will,\u201d preceding and referring to \u201cthat Alexander and Duncan work on the farm,\u201d &c. These words immediately follow gifts and bequests to his sons Douglas and Robert, upon condition to pay two of their sisters sums of money therein stated, and then proceeds \u201cand further that Alexander and Duncan Oliver work on the farm,\u201d &c. As I view the rule of construction, it would not be sufficient if the testator had in the most positive terms ordered and directed his sons Alexander and Duncan to work on the farm, unless he added something to avoid the bequests to them if they failed to do so. Besides, he made no disposition over of the sums bequeathed to them, which, it must be concluded, he would have done had he intended to limit their right to the legacies by a condition that they should work on the farm. The absence of such a provision is evidence, I think, sufficient to raise the presumption that he intended the bequests to them to be unconditional. Apart from the rule of construction before stated, were we permitted to speculate as to the intention of the testator, I would be inclined, even in that case, to doubt that intention to have been the annexing of the condition. The onus, even in the latter case, of shewing such an intention beyond any reasonable doubt, was on the appellants, and I think that they have failed to do so. The bequest in the first instance is clear and certain, and cannot be avoided by words of doubtful meaning that are capable of two interpretations and which may be construed differently, as it appears has been done in this case before it came to this court. For the reasons given, I am of the opinion the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014We must consider the testator\u2019s will as a whole, and collect therefrom his intention irrespective of the fact that his will is divided into paragraphs, and so doing we cannot fail to see that the legacies of $1,600 to each of the testator\u2019s sons, Alexander and Duncan, mentioned in the fourth paragraph, are the same legacies as those of like amount which are mentioned in the third paragraph, in which the testator indicates how he contemplated that the fund to pay these legacies should be raised. The right of Alexander and Duncan to those legacies would be complete under the third paragraph without the addition of the fourth, which, in truth, adds no force to the gift as contained in the third, but defines the time when these legacies shall become payable. By the third paragraph it is apparent that the testator contemplated that the term which he granted to his widow, and Alexander, Duncan, Douglas, Robert, Helen and Agnes, should be instrumental in creating the fund out of which the legacies to Alexander and Duncan should be paid, for it is granted on condition that they all shall unite in paying those legacies. Now, the testator never could have contemplated that the grantees of this term should contribute to this fund simply by a money payment, and that so contributing they should have power to alien and dispose of them as they should think fit, for in such case, as Alexander and Duncan were themselves to contribute to the fund out of which their legacies were to come, if the contribution contemplated was such a money payment, they would not receive their $1,600 each. When, then, we find in the 5th paragraph the testator, in connection with these same legacies, declaring his intention and will to be that Alexander and Duncan respectively shall work on the farm, which is mentioned in the third paragraph and in respect of which the term is granted, until the respective periods, in that paragraph also mentioned, at which their respective legacies shall become payable, this declaration of the testator\u2019s will, plainly enough, I think, indicates his intention and will to be that they shall not enjoy the benefit of the bequest unless they shall respectively conform to this direction, and shall so contribute to the creation of the fund out of which the testator contemplated that payment of their legacies should be made. By conforming to this direction, they become, as it appears to me, relieved from any further obligation to continue working on the farm after their respective legacies became payable, but it is, I think, sufficiently apparent upon the face of this inartistically made will, that the testator\u2019s intention was that Alexander and Duncan respectively should continue to work on the farm, at least until the period named for their respective legacies becoming due, and that this intention was conceived, partly in the interest of the testator\u2019s widow and younger children, who, at the time of his death, were incapable of taking part in the management of the farm, and partly that Alexander and Duncan should, by their labour, contribute to the creation of the fund out of which the testator contemplated that their legacies should be paid.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, and that the plaintiff\u2019s bill in the Court of Chancery, as affects the legacy in question here, should be dismissed with costs to the appellants in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Fitch & Lees.\nSolicitors for respondents: Bruce, Walker & Burton.\n[1] 6 Ont.

Ritchie, Knight, c. J., and Fournier Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nAPPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\n41 Vic., chs. 6 & 7 (N. B.)\u2014By-law of city of St. John.\u2014Building erected in violation of.\u2014Negligence of contractor.\u2014Liability of employer\u2014Several defendants appearing by same attorney.\u2014Separate counsel at trial\u2014Cross-appeal\u2014Rent, loss of.\u2014Damages.\nOn the 26th September, 1877, S. contracted to erect a proper and legal building for W. on his (W.'s) land, in the city of St. John Two days after, a by-law of the city of St. John, under the act of the legislature, 41 Vic., c. 6, \"The St. John Building Act, 1877,\" was passed, prohibiting the erection of buildings such as the one contracted for, and declaring them to be nuisances. By his contract, W. reserved the right to alter or modify the plans and specifications, and to make any deviation in the construction, detail or execution of the work without avoiding the contract, &c., &c. By the contract it was also declared that W. had engaged B. as superintendent of the erection\u2014his duty being to enforce the conditions of the contract, furnish drawings, &c., make estimates of the amount due, and issue certificate. While W.'s building was in course of erection, the centre wall, having been built on an insufficient foundation, fell, carrying with it the party wall common to W. and McM., his neighbour. On an action by McM. against W. and S. to recover damages for the injury thus sustained, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for general damages, $3,952, and $1,375 for loss of rent. This latter amount was found separately, in order that the court might reduce it, if not recoverable. On motion to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a non-suit or new trial, the verdict was allowed to stand for $3,952, the amount of the general damages found by the jury. On appeal to the Supreme Court and cross-appeal by respondent to have verdict stand for the full amount awarded by the jury\u2014\nHeld, (Gwynne, J., dissenting), 1. That at the time of the injury complained of, the contract for the erection of W.'s building being in contravention of the provisions of a valid by-law of the city of St. John, the defendant W. his contractors and his agent (S.) were all equally responsible for the consequences of the improper building of the illegal wall which caused the injury to McM. charged in the declaration.\n2. That the jury, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, could adopt the actual loss of rent as a fair criterion by which to establish the actual amount of the damage sustained, and therefore the verdict should stand for the full amount claimed and awarded.\nPer Gwynne, J., dissenting, That W. was not, by the terms of the contract, liable for the injury, and, even if the by-law did make the building a nuisance, the plaintiff could not, under the pleadings in the case, have the benefit of it.\nThe defendants appeared, by the same attorney, pleaded jointly by the same attorney, and their defence was, in substance, precisely the same, but they were represented at the trial by separate counsel. On examination of plaintiff's witness, both counsel claimed the right to cross-examine the witness.\nHeld (affirming the ruling of the judge at the trial), that the judge was right in allowing only one counsel to cross-examine the witness.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] discharging a rule nisi for a non-suit or a new trial.\nThe facts of the case are, shortly, these: The respondent and the appellant Walker are owners of lots adjoining each other situate on the east side of Prince William Street in the city of St. John, the buildings on these having been swept away in the great fire of June, 1877. The respondent commenced to erect a building on his lot, one Spears being the contractor, and shortly afterwards the appellant Walker entered into a contract with Spears to erect the mason work of a block of stores to be erected on his lot, the stores to be brick. Miller and Nice had a contract to build, finish and complete the carpentering, painting and plumbing of the buildings,\u2014this being an entirely independent contract from that of Spears; it is dated the same day. Under these contracts, Spears, Miller and Nice went on with the building of appellant's building, and the walls were up to the top and ready for roofing; the floors were laid three stories. Under Act of Assembly 41 Vic. chs. 6 and 7, the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, on the 26th Sept. A.D., 1877, had passed a by-law relating to the construction of buildings. The walls to be built according to the contract contravened the provisions of the by-law. On the 6th Dec., 1877, a heavy rain storm took place, and in the afternoon the centre wall of Walker's building gave way, bringing down the other walls, tearing away the party wall between the building and respondent's building, and doing considerable damage to respondent's building. The foundation, it would appear, was defective and improperly built, but had been approved by the architect. For this damage the respondent commenced an action in the Supreme Court, to which the appellants pleaded several special pleas; in these pleas the principal allegation is that the buildings so being erected were not in possession of or under the control of the appellants, or either of them, but in the possession and under the control of Spears.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Weldon and a special jury at the St. John circuit, November, 1879, when the jury, under the charge of the learned judge, found a verdict for the plaintiff for $5,327.32, including $1,375 for loss of rent.\nThe motion for a new trial was made on a variety of grounds, and the first ground was the refusal of the judge to permit the counsel of each defendant to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses and to address the jury for the defendant.\nThe defendants appeared by one attorney and united in their defence, which was substantially the same; but on the trial they appeared by different counsel, but during the progress of the trial no different defence was set up by either defendant. The other grounds were: improper reception of evidence; improper rejection of evidence; the refusal of the judge to order a non-suit; misdirection.\nAfter argument for a new trial the court refused the rule, the verdict being reduced by the amount of the rent. The appellants thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the respondent, by way of cross-appeal, claimed that the verdict should stand for the full amount awarded by the jury, $3,952 for general damages, and $1,375 for rent.\nMr. Kaye, Q.C., and Dr. Tuck, Q.C., for appellants, and Mr. Weldon, Q.C., and Dr. Barker, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe principle arguments urged and authorities cited are reviewed at length in the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Mr. Justice Gwynne. See also report of the case in New Brunswick reports[2].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\n[After having stated the pleadings, proceeded as follows:]\nAll the pleas are by defendants, by S. R. Thomson, their attorney, and are signed by Mr. Kaye as counsel for defendants.\nAt the trial it is said in the case:\nMr. Weldon and Mr. Barker for the plaintiff.\nMr. Thomson for Walker.\nMr. Kaye for Spears.\nMr. Thomson cross-examines the first witness. Mr. Kaye proposes to cross-examine witness as his counsel Mr. Spears. This being objected to by plaintiff's counsel.\nJudge:\u2014I rule, as the defendants have not severed in their pleadings there is no right that the defendants' counsel can be heard to cross-examine the witness, the plea is for both, one attorney and one counsel.\nThe witness appears then to have been further cross-examined by Mr. Thomson. Plaintiff's second witness was cross-examined by Mr. Kaye, when, at the close of his cross-examination, Mr. Thomson claimed the right, as counsel for Mr. Walker, to cross-examine the witness, Mr. Kaye being counsel for Spears.\nThe learned judge stated that, in accordance with his previous ruling, only one counsel could cross-examine the witness.\nAs the defendants appeared by the same attorney, pleaded jointly by the same attorney, and the pleas were all signed by the same counsel, and the same attorney and counsel appeared on the trial, and the defence, being in no material sense different and distinct, but on the contrary the defence of both being in substance precisely the same, under the circumstances I think the judge was right in refusing to allow the defendants to be represented separately at the trial. This was a matter relating to the conduct of the suit, and was in his discretion, and in my opinion no fault can be found in the way he exercised that discretion.\nAs to the merits:\nOn the 5th September, 1877, 41 Vic., c. 6, \"An Act to amend the law for the better prevention of conflagrations in the city of St. John,\" and 41 Vic., c. 7 were passed.\nSec. 7 of 41 Vic., c. 7 is as follows:\n7. The inspector shall have full power to decide upon any questions arising under the provisions of this Act, and of the by-laws passed under the authority of this Act, relative to the manner of construction or materials to be used in the construction, alteration or repair of any building in the city of St. John, and he may require that, plans of the proposed erection, alteration or repairs shall be submitted for inspection before issuing his permit; provided, however, that should any question arise between the inspector and the owner or architect of any building, or should the owner or architect object to any order or decision of the said inspector, the matter shall be referred to the arbitrament of three persons (who shall be either architects or master builders), one to be chosen by the inspector, one by the owner or other person interested, and these two shall choose a third, and the decision of these referees, or any two of them, submitted in writing, shall be final and conclusive on the matter referred.\n8. The inspector shall examine all buildings in the course of erection, alteration or repair throughout the city, as often as practicable, and make a record of all violations of any provision of this act, or of the by-laws made under the authority of this act, together with the street and number where such violations are found, the names of the owners, lessee, occupants, architect and master mechanics, and all other matters relative thereto.\n27. No building shall be erected hereafter in any part of the city of St. John, without a permit being first obtained from the inspector of buildings, and no addition or alteration to any building, subject to the regulations of this act, shall be made without a permit from the said inspector.\n30. The Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of St. John, in Common Council, are hereby authorized and empowered from time to time to make, ordain, amend and rescind by-laws and ordinances regulating the mode of constructing buildings in the city of St. John, and any part thereof, with a view to ensuring the sufficient, safe and proper construction thereof, and the security of life and limb, and protection against fire.\n31. Whosoever shall commit or make any act or default contrary to the provisions of this act, or contrary to any of the provisions of any by-law or ordinance made under the authority of this Act, shall be liable to a penalty of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars for every such act or default, to be recovered by proceedings to be taken in the name of the inspector of buildings, before the police magistrate of the city of St. John, or other magistrate sitting at the police office in the said city; and in default of payment, the person convicted shall be committed to the common gaol of the city and county of St. John for a period of not more than two calendar months, in the discretion of the committing magistrate. 32. Whosoever, having been convicted as last aforesaid, shall permit the continuance of any matter or thing contrary to the provisions of this act, or contrary to any of the provisions of any bylaw or ordinance made as aforesaid, shall, for each day's continuance after such conviction, be liable to a further penalty of not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars, to be recovered before the police magistrate of the city of St. John, or sitting magistrate at the Police Office in said city, in the same manner and with the like effect as hereinbefore mentioned in the last preceding section provided.\nOn the 24th September, 1877, defendant entered into a contract with J. & W. C. Spears for the erection of a building on his lot adjoining that of plaintiffs, and signed the following:\u2014\nThis agreement, made this twenty-fourth day of September A.D., 1877, between J. & W C Spears, parties of the first part, and James Walker, party of the second part, witnesseth, the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the payments to be made by them by the said second party as hereinafter provided, do hereby contract and agree to furnish all the material, labor, tools, machinery, etc., and to build, finish and complete for the said second party all the masons' and other trades of the block of stores to be erected on Prince William Street, east side, between Princess and King Streets, to be described as in the foregoing specifications, and according to the plans and drawings therein especially referred to; which plans and drawings are declared to be a part of this agreement.\nAnd the second party, for and in consideration of the said first party fully and faithfully executing the aforesaid work, and furnishing all the materials therefor, as specified, so as to fully carry out the design according to its true spirit, meaning and intent, and in the manner and by and at the times set forth in the foregoing specification, and to the full and complete satisfaction of John C. Babcock, superintendent as aforesaid, doth hereby agree to pay to the said first party as the work progresses, and as the same shall be certified to by the said superintendent, the sum of ten thousand four hundred and forty-one ($10,441) dollars, to be paid in the following manner: On demand, as the work progresses, in payments amounting to seventy-five per cent. of the amount as set forth and specified above, and as the same shall be certified by the superintendent, and the balance of twenty-five per cent. as shall be found due as hereinafter provided.\nIt is further agreed by the parties that the twenty-five per cent. aforesaid agreed to be reserved by second party from the value of work executed, shall be held by second party until the full completion of the work to the satisfaction of the superintendent aforesaid, as security for the proper execution of the contract by first party, and as indemnity, as far as the same is sufficient, to be applied on the liquidation of any damages arising under this contract.\nIt is further agreed by the parties hereto that all the foregoing conditions and stipulations shall be mutually binding upon executors and administrators.\nIn witness whereof, the parties hereto have set their hands the day and year first above written.\nJAMES WALKER,\nJ. & W. C. SPEARS.\nJOHN C. BABCOCK.\nAnd in the specifications referred to we find;\n\"\u00a7 V. The proprietor has engaged John C. Babcock as superintendent of the erection and completion of said building; his duty being faithfully to enforce all the conditions of the contract, and to furnish all necessary drawings and information required to properly illustrate the design given; also to make estimates for the contractor of the amounts due to him on the contract, in no case estimating any materials or work which are objectionable, or have not become permanent parts of the work; and when the building is completed, to issue a certificate to the contractor, which certificate, if unconditional, shall be an acceptance of the contract, and shall release him from all further responsibility on account of the work.\n\u00a7 VI. It is to be understood by the contractors that the building or work is entirely at their risk until the same is accepted, and they will be held liable for its safety to the amount of money paid by the proprietor on account of the same.\n\u00a7 VII. In case of any unusual or unnecessary delay, or inability, by the contractor in providing and delivering the necessary materials, and performing the necessary labor at the time the same is required, so as to insure the completion and delivery of the building or work at the time hereinafter set forth and contracted; then, and in such case, the proprietor, within three days after having notified the contractor of his intention so to do, shall have the right to enter upon the work and procure such necessary materials or labor to be furnished or performed, as the case may require; and remove from the same all defective materials or workmanship as in the judgment of the superintendent may be found necessary, and carry on the work to completion in such way as shall be proper and right, charging the cost thereof to the contractor, and deducting such charges from the amount of the contract price.\n\u00a7 VIII. The proprietor reserves the right by conferring with the superintending architect, to alter and modify the plans and this specification in particular, and the architect shall be at liberty to make any deviation in the construction, detail, or execution, without in either case invalidating or rendering void the contract. And in case such alteration or deviation shall increase or diminish the cost of doing the work, the amount to be allowed to the contractor or proprietor shall be such as may be equitable and just.\nOn the 26th September, 1877, by-laws were passed by the mayor, &c., of the city of St. John, in common council, under the authority of the 30th sec. of 41 Vic., ch. 7, regulating the mode of constructing buildings in the city of St. John. In the latter part of September the building was commenced, the centre wall of the building having been misplaced was taken down and rebuilt; it is admitted on all hands that this wall was not built in compliance with the acts or by-laws and was not properly built. On the 6th December, this wall gave way, fell, and with it brought down the wall of plaintiff's building. The defendants contend that having contracted with a competent person they were not liable for the damage done plaintiff's building by the falling of this wall.\nThere was evidence to show that a large quantity of sand for building purposes had been put in the building for the convenience and use of the contractors, and that a somewhat continuous rain having come on, and the building not being roofed, the weight of the water and the sand contributed to the fall of the wall, though Mr. Causey, an experienced builder called by the defendants, and who rebuilt the wall, says:\nI went to rebuild in the trench. The original was twelve inches astray. I saw indications on the clay. He said if the wall had been built in its present position as laid out on the plan it must have been on the clay. Half of it in the front part. It had not gone down to the rock in the right place. I re-built as laid down in the plan. I got down to the rock. I got the rock for it from the cellar floor. The wall had got to the solid rock in front. Other part on clay. I should say it was not a proper job. I think Spears could not have known from the character I have heard of him. If so badly built it is a wonder to me it held until it got to the top.\nThe work was superintended by Mr. Babcock, defendants' architect, and Spears his agent. For the work done on the building the architect, under sec. 5 of the specifications, gave certificates as follows:\u2014\nSt John, November 2nd, 1877.\nThis certifies that Messrs. J. & W. C. Spears are entitled to the payment of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) for labour and material supplied to building of James Walker, Esq., east side of Prince William Street, between King and Princess Streets, St, John, according to contract.\n\"$3,000.00.\nJOHN C. BABCOCK.\nReceived the above amount,\nJ. & W. C. SPEARS.\nSt. John, November 24th, 1877.\n\"This is to certify that Messrs. J. & W. C. Spears are entitled to a payment of twenty three hundred dollars ($2,300.00) for labour and material furnished to building of Dr. Jno. Walker, on the east side of Prince William Street, between King and Princess Streets, Saint John, N. B., according to contract.\n\"$2,300.00.\nJOHN C. BABCOCK.\nArchitect and Superintendent.\nJ. & W. C. SPEARS.\nI think it is clearly established that injury was occasioned by the centre wall of the Walker building giving way, and there was conclusive evidence that this wall was improperly built on an improper foundation, was too weak, and was contrary to the statute and the by-laws.\nSimeon Jones, in his evidence, says:\nI know the buildings and recollect the occasion. I was on Prince William street near King. I heard a noise and saw the Walker building apparently settle down in the middle and fall, and I think the side of McMillan building fell out. Settled down in the middle and fell down. I could not see the rear of the building. Michael W. Maher:\nI reside in St. John. Am Inspector of buildings since September, 1877. I knew the properties of McMillan and Walker before they fell. They are east of the street Prince William. I am practical builder for 40 years. I have been architect and practical builder. * * * I saw the Walker building a story above the street. I went to visit it. I think they were putting on the beams. I went there; I saw Mr. Spears and enquired who had charge of the building. I hunted up Mr. Spears and told him that the walls were not according to the law, and the vibration in the walls. Mr. Spears said he thought it good enough. I saw Spears near Yeats' iron store. I saw him at the building the next day or soon after, and met Spears, I think it was by appointment. I told him what I required. Spears, Babcock and John McMillan. I think Mr. Spears asked if I would not allow to get the building covered in when he would do it. I would not for or against. I wanted several courses of the\u2014 Mr. Spears spoke of spikes and ordinary concrete would do better. I spoke to Mr. Spears. He said he was the inspector of the building. I did not say anything; I was rather taken aback. The character of the building for storage and warehouse buildings. I stated what the law required me to have done, and then Mr. Spears said he\u2014\"\nThe sentence breaks off here, but I presume it has reference to what he said a moment before. Spears had said that he was the inspector of the building.\nJoseph Pritchard says:\nI reside in St. John. I know the Walker building. I have had conversation with Mr. Spears. He asked me what I thought of the building. I told him they looked very well, a few days before they fell, as far as they were. I said if the building was mine I would not have those shores in front. I said I would not trust them. He said that they were going to put iron pillars there. I said in the meantime the posts would have to support the whole of the building above. He asked to go and see it, and said it is stronger than you think it is. I told him I would not like to trust them myself to be under. The shore was under the front floor. There was no wall in front. The shore looked like a piece of scantling or deal. I was on the opposite side of the street.\nThe evidence of Spears, the contractor, is as follows:\nI arranged for the building on the Walker lot. I spoke of John C. Babcock; he was here before I came. I entered into a written contract with Dr. Walker for the building on the lot adjoining McMillan's. (Called for and produced by defendants). This is the contract. Only one signed. This is my signature of the firm and Dr. Walker, signed in presence of Babcock (the architect).\nNo. 2 contract.\nBabcock same person I spoke of. I went on to construct this building. Miller & Nice had the contract for the carpenter work; it went on as I progressd with my contract. I began latter part of September to build; I went on. Babcock furnished me with plans\u2014this is one. (One produced. No. 3.) * * * * * * * * This plan was given to me by Babcock as the working plan. The building is 65 feet high, 26 feet from the face of the McMillan wall to the face of the centre wall, and 26 feet to the face of the south wall. I worked under that plan from the commencement. I commenced the foundation, and I had to excavate extra to the rock in front, and ran to the rear. I built the stone wall and was ready for the first tier of beams. Walker and Spears were both there occasionally. I should judge a small space. There was a mistake in the plan. I went to the Babcock office as he was away. There was a foot of a mistake; it was a foot too near the McMillan building. Babcock suggested me to build another wall alongside this. I told him it would be, my judgment-would be, against the doing this, as it would be on two separate foundations\u2014better way to take down and re-build it; and it was done. I was directed, but can't state the language he used. I had previously built according to the plan. I took it down and re-built it. I then went on with the building. Mr. Spears was there while the building was in progresse Dr. Walker was there occasionally. Mr. Spears every day, some times several times a day. * * * Mr. Maher was in there one day and Mr. Spears and Babcock were there. We were in the front. Maher said the space was wider than the law provided, and the centre wall was not strong enough, that was his opinion. Mr. Spears had some words, and said he would make himself superintendent of the building, and Mr. Maher went away. Afterwards Maher came and told Mr. Spears that the wall, cellar wall, must be increased in thickness. This was the second time, Spears came and he wanted Maher to allow him to enclose the building, and he would increase the wall. Maher did not allow this to be done, I was asked for my, opinion, was by driving a spike three inches into the wall and bricks four inches, and by that way add four inches to the wall. Maher or Spears asked me if I could build a wall, in the way I stated, to be as strong as if 16 inch. I declined an opinion. The centre wall was left 16 inches as it originally was. Some weeks\u2014three or four\u2014the building fell. When Maher first came it was one story; the second time I think a second story was up. I notified Mr. Babcock to have the roof put on to protect the building, but it was not done Mr. Spears came there\u2014was annoyed at my not having more men as the work was not progressing. I told him it was going up faster than it ought to in my judgment. He said it was necessary to get the top on before the winter set in. I said in my judgment I would not put them along as fast as they were going. I told there was a great mass of green material and it was put up too fast in my judgment. I had not been in New Brunswick before; I had only built in New York and Brooklyn, McMillan's building fell 6th December about four o'clock, * * * Before the rain storm came on the building was allright. I received from Mr. Spears on the contract $5,300. I had certificates from Mr. Babcock which I gave to Mr. Spears when I got these payments. (These certificates called for). I never got the certificates back again.\nNo. 3. November 2, 1877, John C. Babcock certificate for $3,000.\nNo. 4. November 24, 1877, John C. Babcock certificate for $2,300.\nThese amounts paid by Mr. Spears to me. Mr. Spears paid me before on the Walker estate, all paid by him to me. The building was nearly all up as before described. I think the upper story was up, the rear and side walls and the centre wall when I got the $3,000; that is all I received. The certificates was given after the conversation between Walker, Spears, Babcock and myself, It would have taken $1,500 to complete my contract with Walker. I built the McMillan party wall; it was well built. The witness makes a plan, shews the jury.\nI spoke of Mr. Maher having said such wall was too slight.\nMaher spoke to me, I spoke to Mr. Spears.\nSpears was hurrying previous to walls being up.\nJohn McMillan another witness:\nMy father and myself are the firm. Dr. Walker in possession of adjoining lot to the lot occupied by my father. I was present when our building was the second story. Walker at first story, adjoining the party wall. Mr. Spears, Mr. Babcock and Mr. Maher called my attention to the centre wall. Mr. Spears said Maher had called his attention to the centre wall and would have it wider, which he thought was absurd. He said he knew as much as Mr. Maher, and he would have himself made inspector. I soon left, and Maher went with me. I did not know Spears until he came here. We had a temporary place on Canterbury street. The building was nearly completed. The outside wholly completed. Preparing the internal fittings. Finally got in about 1st January. What rent were you to pay?\nObjected. (I am of opinion it is somewhat doubtful whether the question is allowable, as the damages on this ground would be too remote; but I think by allowing it and the damages are agreed rent, the question may be put; no injury can be done in such view of it) Mr. Thomson objects to this.\nThe firm of J. & A. McMillan had agreed to rent the building from the plaintiff. The rent was to be 10 per cent. on the outlay, $3,000 a year. 1st January, 1878, to the time we got into it after its being repaired would be $1,250. The latter part of June we got into it. * * * * * * *\nCross-examined:\nI am quite sure of the conversation I had with Spears in Maher's presence was in the Walker building.\nJames McMillan, plaintiff, says:\nThis building I had put up to be occupied by the firm.\nThe defendant's case.\nWilliam Miller:\nI am a carpenter. I did the Walker building carpenter work. There was with me George Nice as co-contractor. Spears did the mason work. Sand was put in the Walker building, next to McMillan. Sand was brought in and dumped against the wall. I spoke to Mr. Spears and told him it would spring the floor. He said it would not do so, and he spoke to Mr. Babcock. He put the shores within 3 feet of the centre wall,\nGeorge Nice, in his cross-examination, says:\nWeight close up to the wall. Babcock told him to spread it over the floor about eighteen inches. The weight would be on the end of the beams. The shores would take the weight off the walls. Spears had been there two or three weeks, it had been screened over a fortnight, * * * Contract was made by Mr. Babcock's directions. He was there every day, and Mr. Spears there every day, and Mr. Walker not so often. I got my money from Mr. Spears.\nRe-examined by Mr. Thomson:\nI was there at the laying of each floor. They were not against the wall nor allowed to do so. They were rough boards and would come down as it fell. No. After sand was in made. Babcock said spread over the floor. Beams 3 x 15. John C. Babcock\nI am an architect. Principally engaged in New York City on my own responsibility. I profess to be a skilled man. Built a great many under my superintendence. I am a witness to the contract. I saw Walker sign and W. C. Spears. I am the architect who prepared the plan; all prepared by me\u2014contract by the contractor. When my plan was made no work done on McMillan's. My plan was made with reference to a particular wall. I had nothing to do with a partition wall. I think it would be a suitable building according to my plan. I have no doubt if my plans were followed. This plan shews the dimensions. This central space constructed. It was to be carried to the rock. I was at the ground when the wall in the centre was commenced. The excavation made. The plan shews here the cellar wall was to be placed from the Wiggins side fifty-five feet. This was to the centre of Wiggins wall to McMillan wall centre fifty-five feet. I did not measure the distance when the trench was dug. Commenced from the centre of Wiggins twenty-four inches. Twenty-four inches on Walker lot. Width of north cellar, 25.6. To McMillan wall twenty-four inches. Cellar wall not located by these figures. I did not know the trench dug was in centre line of my plan. It had gone to the rock. The rock was about four feet from the centre line of the building and came to a foot in rear. The wall was carried up to the street level. I think I was the first to discern it was wrong. The McMillan wall carried up some distance, cannot say how far. When I discerned I had to see how the mistake occurred. I put it right in the rear, but not in the front. Wall to rear of McMillan building at the front. I pointed this out. We concluded to take it down and build it right. I saw Mr. Spears about it. It may be first or second day of May. It was done very quickly. I saw some portions taken down, not all. When I next saw it, it was nearly re-built. I had not seen it between those two periods. It would be necessary to excavate the trench for the alteration. I did not see it done. I suppose it had been done; I did not know it was done. I did not tell Spears' foreman I had discovered a mistake.\n(Mr. Kaye reads from his notes of evidence what Mr, Spears said in his evidence, and he asks the witness if that is true. This being objected to by Mr. Barker, I express my opinion that it is not regular, but the witness is to state what took place between him and Mr. Spears and not what is read by Mr. Kaye and taken down by him. The witness may give his version of the conversation).\nThere was some measurement made as to see how much it was out of line, and some suggestions made as to whether the error could not be redressed in the first story by moving over the wall. I could not agree to that, and I ordered the wall to be taken down. I did not suggest to Mr. Spears to build any other wall alongside of it. It would not be practicable. When you sent for Spears a general conversation took place, but I can't recollect exactly what was said. I regretted the error had been made in locating the wall. I did not tell Spears it was my mistake. The wall was not built in the first instance according to the plan. Some time after the accident I did discover the new wall had not been built on the rock, or some of it. After the accident I discovered a part had not been built up from the foundation (trench, rock). The beams were sixteen inch from centre in second, third and fourth floors, to twelve inch to centre of beam in first floor. The beams bore five inches in the under. The beams are bevelled below to save the walls in case of fire. The flooring was laid across the beams. Ordinary rough spruce boards. Rough stuff the 1 1\/4. On the floor. The beams are cut to allow a deflection. The boards were laid on the beams; nailed, but open so water would pass through. Not roofed; all the rain that I ever saw in that building passed through the floor. I don't think the rain would pass over the floor to the side at the walls. I heard Miller and Nice's statements. Can you, from the work done in that building by Miller and Nice, speak as to their capacity as carpenters?\n(Objected to); I only judge from that work. The carpenters, in my opinion, were competent to do the work they contracted for.\nI saw sand on the building, in the north side, from front to rear, fifteen or twenty feet from the front. It was placed adjoining to the central wall the highest and sloped to McMillan's wall. It went to the vault, about fifty feet in length. When first put in half the distance in the width, but afterwards spread out. Between McMillan and the centre the cart passed through. A considerable quantity in when I first saw it. It was added to. I gave directions to Mr. Spears regarding it a week or ten days before the accident. I could not say exactly the quantity. And to spread over the surface to a depth of more than eighteen inches. I first ordered it to be taken away, and therefore allowed it to remain if spread over the building. Sand laid on a four inch ledge. A large portion of the sand was levelled off as I directed. I directed on several occasions. I said I thought it dangerous to place so much sand, it might injure the walls. I am not aware of any assent being given before the sand was brought in. What would be the effect of a body of sand? It would affect the wall. I thought there was sand enough for the building or more. A cubic yard of wet sand 1 1\/2 ton. I should think between seventy-five and one hundred tons there of sand. After the accident I found a part of the front portion of the wall had not been carried to the rock. The base of the wall was a little wider than the wall, and the ground widened the bearing on the wall. If there had been no sand, the rain in my opinion would not carry down the wall. It lad received injury from the sand before the rain. The wall had been effected by the sand before the rain came. I generally visited the building every morning, most generally twice a day. I did not actually see everything done. The rain would strike the wall and run down it. I heard Captain Pritchard give his testimony. I said there was no wooden shore in front. Iron columns was in before the accident, not less than a week. No boards on the roof of the Walker building. The fire walls not complete. Side and rear complete. I think no unnecessary delay in putting on the roof. I have recollection of McMillan's roof; rain fell through it. I can't say about the fire wall being carried out. Board could be put on before the parapet were put. I allowed a girder to run fore and aft in the cellar, resting on brick piers in lieu of the timber in the specification, which it was impossible to get. I saw McMillan's wall and party wall. 8.4.8 beams rested practically on an eight inch wall. Not so strong as a sixteen inch solid wall. This stopped at second story. Vaulted up two stories and then carried up fifteen inch solid. The sixteen inch would balance on the side of the 8.4.8. The upper part of the wall would be stronger than below, in my opinion. A large portion of the McMillan fell out by the withe anchor of ours, and one wall giving way. The sixteen inch wall or stronger than the hollow wall of 2.8. I think the party wall was defective in this respect. 26th September, the date of the contract; plan made before, I think. Spears' men worked in the buildings of McMillan and Walker. I knew Mr. Spears before he built here. He had erected, etc.\nI observed a shore on McMillan's building, in front of the iron column. I saw nothing the matter with it.\nCross-examined by Mr. Weldon:\nI came to St. John in July, after the fire. The Spears were builders, and had given satisfaction to the work done. I recommended them to come. My plans were made before the contract. The figures and details are on the plans to work by. I gave them measurements. They are bound by them and the figures on the plan. The contractor will not err when it is followed. I gave one to Spears from the centre wall to the centre of the wall or from face to face 27.6. Right through from face to face 25.6. Explain the measure 13.9 altered. I don't think the alteration was made after the mistake was discovered. Either plan would. I can't tell the alteration when made. Altered from 25.6 to 26.6. No mistake in the figures. The alterations in the plan were made in my office. I can't say whether the alteration was made before or after. I think the alteration was made after the commencement of the wall. He had no right to take from that side. I think 25.6. On 24.6. There is a discrepancy. I don't think I was wrong. 2.24.6. 26.6.2. 13.3 to locate the pier after first wall was built. There is an alteration, 13.3 to 39. The wall ready for beams. The trench was to the wall. I discovered a break in the wall, and the error would diminish one foot to nothing in the distance of sixty feet of the height to a sharp pointed wedge. It had to go ten inches beyond the trench. I had to give certificates, and the work was done to my satisfaction. I knew I employed a competent man to do it, and I expected it was done. I think I found out the error first. I relied on my plan in my office. Mr. Watson was my assistant. Did you tell Spears. I had taken a wrong point? I did not. I do not think the error is the original. The other working plan is corrected by it.\nI gave the certificate up to 24th November. 2nd November. There was a permit got. The party wall was, I think, up. I think the wall of McMillan was up. I made some objection. I had solid done when I wanted. It was rear. There was, I think, over three feet. The joist did not always strike the withes. More beams put up stairs. Below twelve inches apart. Would the milky water indicate water running down the wall? There must be milk. It would indicate lime. Would it percolate the foundation? It would not, I think, the brick, it might the stone. Not many alterations made. Spears was the agent, he paid for Walker. I obeyed Mr. Spears' directions. Did Mr. Maher call your attention to the wall? He did. He did not tell me it was an unsafe wall. I did not hear the conversation between Mr, Maher and Spears. Maher did not tell me the wall would not do. We were to do. It was to be done. No terms were fixed between Wiggins and us. There was an old wall twenty-four inches. We had nineteen inches as a party wall in Walker's. It is, I think, the dividing line at the centre of the wall. It was intended as a sixteen inch, but large brick made it an eighteen inch wall.\nI think Maher was there twice. A second time he insisted his direction were to be carried out. He kept increasing it. I never told Spears to put up the shores. I did not know it until after the accident. I did not tell Spears. I found under wall on the sand side was gone. Perfectly' sound on other side. The sand was. The centre wall gave way and the building fell. Sand levelled before the accident. I think engaged in taking. Fifty cubic yards, 1 1\/2, 75 tons. Dry sand much less. I think McMillan's roof was not tight. I think it was three inch deal in front of McMillan. Thirty feet width of McMillan. A stick eighteen and twenty-four would not' carry it without deflection. A brick tier and iron column. I don't know how the weight was distributed. The beam and anchor well in the wall. It brought down the whole by the withes. We do not use hollow party walls in the States. I have seen them. The withes are not equal to the solid wall. 13.9 is my figure.\nRe-examined by Mr. Thomson:\nThese figures are the original in my office. The plan may have been in the office. One cellar is a foot wider than the other if the wall was located from that line. I discovered the deflection. The building would be a foot narrower in the front or rear He had it partly up. It was his duty and he thought so. I found it after the building fell. I believe the effect of the sand. No danger of dry sand in a proper place. I gave a certificate after as percentage to make good if any irregulation. All party walls are carried up solid. The solid wall would increase the weight. No such indication as a milky wall. I examined the wall after the accident. I am satisfied they were close was such they as my saying I had made a mistake; It made no matter who made the mistake, it would have to be altered. Soft crust ought to go to the rock; I saw a shore in front: The\nBy a Juror\u2014Is it customary to cover that wall with boards?\nI can't say it was, I don't know.\nTUESDAY, 25th November;\nWhat did you mean by I obeyed Mr. Spears' directions? I obeyed meant such directions as one would give to his architect. I had received directions to prepare plans and specifications, and, secondly, to receive tenders; also, what tender to accept, and prepare agreement with that party to arrange for commencement of work and order of payment. That is the usual directions. After the contract was made he did not interfere with me in any particular. Mr. Spears was away a good deal of the time:\nCross-examined by Mr. Barker:\nI did not tell him a mistake had been made; he must have known it. He was in Halifax a part of the time. Spears was often there. I think he complained of the work not going on as fast as he could. I spoke to Spears: It was not necessary, in consequence of what Mr: Spears said. It was partly, not to a very great extent, by his influence: I can't tell you. I won't say it was not. I spoke before the beginning of the building. Was not Spears there constantly? He was there about the building, I thought I had no conversation about the wall, I won't swear I had not. It was my own judgment about the wall. After work had progressed I got the permit, (Mr. Thomson\u2014It was in writing. You have already said so, have'nt you?)\nRe-examined:\nThis wall was ordered down by my directions. He, Spears, gave no order, neither directly or indirectly:\nWilliam Causey:\nI am a mason. In St John forty to fifty years. I have looked at the contract. I don't presume to be much of a judge of the carpenter work. The foundation was built and what the contract describes. All foundation walls to bed in solid rock, which will be levelled off and shaped off as directed or required, laying all footings on large flat stone, bedded in cement when rock may not show sound or fit to be removed, and concrete substituted. Would such a foundation, if made, would it be proper and sufficient? (Objected to by Mr. Barker). It would be proper for such a building and fit and sufficient.\nstone wall ready for coutract. The work would be quite sufficient.\nThe usual way of doing it as described in contract. Head of granite pier sufficient. The usual way. Freestone. The general way. Specification.\nThe brick wall would be sufficient if properly built. A 16 inch wall would be sufficient for offices and stores anchored as required. The contract is such if carried out would, in my opinion, be sufficient. Walls secured by anchor would be sufficient. I have done walls as thus described. I am of opinion it is sufficient. A building so constructed would, in my opinion, be sufficient. I had to examine after the building fell next morning. I could not for the debris. I went to re-build in the trench. The original was twelve inches astray. I saw indications on the clay. He said if the wall had been built in its present position as laid out on the plan it must have been on the clay. Half of it in the front part. It had not gone down to the rock in the right place. I re-built as laid down in the plan. I got down to the rock. I got the rock for it from the cellar floor. The wall had got to the solid rock in front. Other part on clay. I should say it was not a proper job. I think Spears could not have known from the character I have heard of him. If so badly built it is a wonder to me it held until it got to the top. * * *\nCross-examined by Mr. Barker:\nI found a trench down to the solid rock sufficient for a two foot base, which was brick, I found it half in the clay; the one part on rock, one on clay. I re-built by a plan according to the dimensions of this plan. My centre wall was a two foot wall. This plan is a sixteen inch. The space would be less. No such vibration on a building used for offices or for iron. This is for storage of heavy goods. Supports would be underneath. Sixteen inch for offices would be sufficient. A wall might dry in a month. Built according to the specification it would take some time in the flat near the ground.\nJames Walker:\nI am a defendant. I had to trust to my architect. I am neither a builder nor contractor, I trusted to my contractor. I believe if Mr. Babcock's specification had been followed there would have been no trouble. I did not interfere more than giving advice to take every precaution to prevent accidents.\nCross-examined by Mr. Weldon:\nBabcock is my architect, and William M. Spears looked after it and attended to it much more than I did. I live five miles from town. I went to the building as it was going along, saw the cellar walls after they re-built them.\nCross-examined:\nSpears made no complaint to me, nor Mr. Maher. Spears endeavoured to allay any suspicious in my mind about the building. Very particular in wanting stone and cement. I once remarked I wanted stronger mortar. He said he understood his business. It was my suggestion, I had to be satisfied. Did not interfere.\nRe-examined:\nThere was talk about the wall. I told Babcock there was a new law, and Babcock had some conversation with Mr. Maher, and he had made it all right. I did not understand what it was.\nRe-examined by Mr. Thomson:\nThis was about the building, and to get a permit, and he told me he had done, and I was told.\nWilliam M. Spears:\nI am one of the defendants. I was acting for him as his agent. After the contract was made. I did not interfere directly or indirectly. I think I saw the building going up from day to day with the contractors. I have too much respect for Captain Pritchard to say I did not say what he said I did, but I have no recollection of it.\nNo. 7. 22nd September, J. Harris & Co., contract for iron work.\nI have no recollection in stating of what Mr. Maher said; if so, it was only in a joke. I have no knowledge of mason work.\nNo idea of taking charge or interfering. I was away two or three weeks every month while the building was progressing. I was executor of the late John Walker, and had to go to Halifax. I did not observe the building. I saw the sand there. Was knowing Spears' men going from one building to another. I had no fear of it, neither of the weight, height or depth of the sand. I cannot remember the quantity there. I merely saw sand what was usually hauled from a wood-boat.\nThe only recollection I have is the taking of the wall down. I saw them altering. Neither consulted or directed anything about it. I did not know the cause for what I had seen until after the accident.\nCross-examined;\nWhile I was in St. John I was there every fine day, sometimes half a dozen times a day, looking after it for Dr. Walker; he spoke to me to do so. I was in Halifax in November probably not less than a fortnight. I was in Halifax half-a-dozen times. I was in Halifax two or three times after the contract was signed, 27th September. I was not there in October. I am not prepared to say that I was more than once in Halifax.\nThere every fine day and several times on some days. I did not know anything about the wall being shifted until after the accident. Building on the Potter property. I don't remember when the conversation when Babcock spoke of. I remember Maher asked what the building was designed for. I went and got a permit from Mr. Maher. I was not present when the I was present when Mr. Maher asked what the building was designed for. He considered a 16 inch wall would be insufficient if converted into warehouse or stores, but if for offices it would be sufficient. Did not Mr. Maher speak of it being contrary to law? I don't remember he did. I will swear that at no time I was doing I suppose Maher was speaking about the regulations. I think this was after we got the permit.\n* * * * * * * * * *\nI think the matter was referred to more than once. I do not ask Mr. Maher to allow me to complete. The centre wall would be made heavier afterwards. There was no arrangement with Mr. Maher or Babcock that I was to strengthen the centre wall. Is it not new to you that Mr. Maher stated to you that the centre wall was not according to law? He did say it was not sufficient for a warehouse, I don't remember, but I won't' swear he did or did not.\nI suppose Maher only came as city inspector. He had nothing that I knew of.\nIf Maher, as city inspector, required you to make alteration? I did not refuse nor did I assent. He inquired if the building was to be used for other purposes than offices. I was to do certain things. It was intended for offices as much as for other purposes. Was it intended for offices?\nIntended for both offices and warehouse purposes.\nThen Mr. Maher's opinion was that if it was for warehouse purposes it was not sufficient? That was a part of the contract for warehouse purposes. It is for warehouse purposes, I never heard otherwise. It was built for wholesale purposes. I did not know it was for that purpose when I had the conversation with Mr. Maher. I did give Mr. Babcock instructions for the building. They were prepared under my directions. I did not know the contract was for wholesale business. I thought it was to be strong enough. So far as my recollection goes I said it was intended to be used for offices, and, if so, it was sufficient. The central wall was not then completed. There was no position demanded to carry it out. I really do not remember what impression was made in my mind. I said I might have said so, but I was not serious in saying I had control.\nI did not take any steps to alter it from what Mr. Maher said. I heard nothing from Mr. Spears. I do not remember speaking to Mr. Babcock after what Maher said. I had a conversation with Mr. Babcock before or after Maher was at the building. I had not much opinion about it and I made no change. I do not remember Babcock made any change in the timber on the girder. I do not know sufficient about the specifications to make, nor of any alteration made. I made no objections. The season was getting late and I was anxious the building to proceed, and I may have spoken to Spears. I did not talk to the parties about the work. I do not recollect speaking to Spears more than once.\nAssuming the work to have been lawful if done in a proper way, and that defendant had entered into a contract with a third person for the performance of the work, and that, therefore, he would not, under certain circumstances, be liable for any negligence on the part of the person with whom he had contracted in the performance of the work, it is very obvious in this case that the work was done under the immediate superintendence of Babcock, the defendant's architect, and defendant's agent, Mr. W. M. Spears, who, plaintiff says, \"looked after it, and attended to it much more than I did.\" The work done on, and materials in, the wall which fell were estimated and certified for under the contract as being properly done by the architect, the contract expressly providing that \"in no ease was he to estimate any materials or work which are objectionable,\" and were paid for by the agent. The evidence clearly shows that, independent of the statutes and bylaws, the work was so improperly done as to create a nuisance which caused the damage to the adjoining proprietor. There can be no doubt, the wall fell from being improperly constructed, and this the jury must be taken to have found, as the judge in his charge said:\nIf you are of opinion that the centre wall was improperly built, and the accident occurred by the falling down by reason of its weakness, or that a sufficient foundation had not been provided to bear the weight necessary for a warehouse, I am of opinion the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the defendants are liable. If the foundation was not on the solid rock or not a sufficient foundation after the inspector pointed it out, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\nOn this ground it would be difficult for defendants to escape liability, but there is another ground on which I prefer to rest my judgment, viz., that the erection of the centre wall which fell and did the damage was an illegal erection, and that all engaged in its erection are liable; Walker, who caused it to be erected; Sears, who superintended its erection, and the party who actually erected it.\nI think it was within the competency of the local legislature to pass these acts.\nThe prohibition imposed was for a public purpose, for the better prevention of conflagrations in the city of St. John, and to regulate the construction of buildings in the city of St. John, and to provide for the due inspection thereof\u201441 Vic., c. 6, being \"An Act to amend the law for the better prevention of conflagrations in the city of St. John,\" and 41 Vic., c. 7, being \"An Act to regulate the construction of buildings in the city of St. John, and to provide for the due inspection thereof.\"\nThese acts were passed for a public purpose, their policy was purely restrictive for the purpose of guarding against fire, and to secure the erection of proper buildings in a city such as St. John. Any erections contrary to the regulations therein imposed being clearly unlawful, beyond all question it was unlawful to contract to do that which it was unlawful to do, and any contract which, though lawful in its inception, by a change in the law became unlawful to fulfil, is necessarily at an end.\nThere can be no doubt that this building was a direct violation of the law and in defiance of the inspector, and was consequently an unlawful erection, and the contract entered into for the erection of such a building was put an end to by the law prohibiting its being carried out, and though a person employing a contractor to do a lawful act may not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of the contractor or his servants in executing that act, yet, if the act itself is wrongful, the employer is responsible for the wrong so done by the contractor or his servants, and is liable to third persons who sustain damage from the doing of that wrong, as was held in Ellis v. The Sheffield Gas Co.[3]. For, can it be doubted that if one person commits an unlawful act or misfeasance under the direction of another both are equally liable to the injured party?\nThere was a statutory duty imposed on owners of property in that part of the city of St. John as to the character of the buildings to be erected and the mode of erection, and the non-compliance with such statutory duty and the erection of a building in contravention of the statutes and by-laws and in defiance of the inspector of buildings, clearly rendered the building a nuisance, had there been no section in the act declaring such erection a nuisance.\nSuch being the case the owner of the land, Walker, and his agent, Spears, and the contractors, Spears & Co., were all, in defiance of an express law and regulation to the contrary, engaged in the erection of a building, the centre wall of which fell and caused the injury complained of, and permitting and causing such wall to be erected, all parties engaged in such unlawful erection were liable for the damage occasioned to the neighboring property by the falling of the wall so erected, such damage being the result of work unlawfully done. Therefore the owner, for whom and at whose instance the work was done, the owner's agent, who superintended and directed and paid for the work, and as he says:\nWhen I was in St. John I was there every fine day, sometimes, half-a-dozen times a day, looking alter it for Mr. Walker, he spoke to me to do so;\nand as Walker says:\u2014\nMr. Wm. M. Spears looked after it and attended to it much more than I did,\ntogether with the parties who were employed to do the work, are equally responsible for the consequences of the improper building of the dangerous and illegal wall which caused the injury to plaintiff charged in the declaration.\nThis case seems to me to come clearly within the principle established in Bower v. Peate[4], and Angus v. Dalton[5]:\nThat where a defendant has employed a contractor to do the work which in its nature is dangerous to a neighbouring property, and damage is the result of the work done, the employer is liable though he has employed a competent contractor and given him directions to take precautions in executing the works.\nHere all the parties were engaged in an illegal act, for when a statute prohibits a particular work being done, a party cannot procure the work to be done and avoid responsibility by contracting with another to do that work. The erection of, or causing to be erected, this wall contrary to law by Walker on his property, being the creation of a nuisance and contrary to the statutory duty imposed on owners of property in respect to erections on their properties in the city of St. John, and mischief having resulted therefrom, it is no answer that the mischievous results arose by reason of the manner in which the owner's contractor performed his work in connection with the erection of the illegal structure. In Stevens v. Gourlay[6] it was held that \"a contract for the erection of a building in contravention of the provisions of the Metropolitan Building Act 18 and 19 Vic., c. 122, cannot be enforced.\" Erle, C. J., in that case said:\nThe contract was for the erection of a building known to the plaintiff to be, or whether known or not, at all events it was in violation of the Metropolitan Building Act 18 and 19 Vic., c. 122.\nAnd, after discussing whether the structure was a building within the meaning of that statute he says:\nUpon the whole, I think this case a contract for the erection of a fabric or structure in violation of the statute, and that the parties being in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis.\nWilliams, J., says:\nAssuming then that this shop was a \"building\" within the statute, the rest of the case is clear. There has been a plain infringement of the act, and the plaintiff is disentitled to recover upon the principle laid down in the case of Foster v. Taylor[7] where it was held that the vendor of butter in a firkin that was not branded as required by 36 Geo. 3, c. 86, could not recover the price of it. That case is a distinct authority to show that the plaintiff cannot be allowed to enforce in a court of justice a contract which has been entered into in violation of the provisions of an Act of Parliament.\nCrowder, J.:\nI am also of opinion that this rule must be made absolute on the ground that the contract declared on was entered into and carried into effect in express violation of the Metropolitan Building Act. In Brooms Legal Maxims[8]:\nIf an exercise of public authority render impossible the further performance of a contract which has been in part performed, the contract is ipso facto dissolved.\nAnd also[9]:\nAgain, we find it laid down where H. covenants not to do an act or thing which was lawful to do, and an act of Parliament comes after and compels him to do it, the statute repeals the covenant. So, if H. covenant to do a thing which is lawful and an act of Parliament comes in and hinders him from doing it, the covenant is repealed. But if a man covenants not to do a thing which then was unlawful, such act of Parliament does not repeal the covenant.\nIn the Bank of U. S. v. Orr[10] the Court said:\nBut when the restrictive policy of a law alone is in contemplation we hold it to be an universal rule that it is unlawful to contract to do that which it is' unlawful to do.\nIn a case in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Sturgess v. Society of Theological Education[11]:\nDefendant having occasion to construct a sewer from the cellar of its building to the common sewer, employed a contractor to do the work. In constructing this sewer it was necessary to cut through a plank barrier which had been constructed beneath the surface of the street to prevent the tide flowing into cellars in that locality. The contractor so negligently performed this part of his work that the tide-water came through the opening made by him and flowed into the cellar of a building owned by plaintiff, adjoining that of defendant. It was held that defendant was liable for the injury done by the tide-water to plaintiff's premises. The owner of a building, who has used due care in the employment of an independent contractor, is not responsible to third persons for the negligence of the latter occurring in his own work in the performance of the contract, such as the handling of tools or materials or providing temporary safeguards while doing the work. Hilliard v. Richardson[12]. Connon v. Hennessy[13]. As to such matters, pertaining to the mode in which he does the work, he is not the servant of the owner. But where the thing contracted to be done from its nature creates a nuisance, or when being improperly done, it creates a nuisance and causes mischief to a third person, the employer is liable for it. Gorham v. Gross[14] and cases cited. In the case at bar the defendant had a right to make an opening through the barrier for the purpose of laying a drain, but it was his duty to close it securely so that the collars should be protected from the tide. Having employed an independent contractor, it is not responsible for his negligent acts while doing the work, because in respect of such acts he is not its servant; but if the work, after it was done, created a nuisance and caused injury to the plaintiff, it is responsible. Sturges v. Society of Theological Education. Opinion by Morton, J.\nAnd in the case of King v. Davenport[15]:\nThe delegation of legislative power to a city to prohibit the erection, placing or repairing of wooden buildings within limits prescribed by ordinance without permission, and to direct and prescribe that all buildings within the limits prescribed shall be made or constructed of fire proof materials, and generally to define and declare what shall be nuisances, and to authorize and direct the summary abatement thereof, etc., is within the competency of legislative power, and authorizes the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the erection or repairing of any building within the fire limits with combustible materials, and providing for the summary abatement or removal of the same. Unwholesome trades, slaughter-houses, operations offensive to the senses, the deposit of powder, the application of steam power to propel cars, the building with combustible materials, and the burial of the dead, may be prohibited in the midst of dense masses of population, on the general principle that every person ought so to use his property as not to injure his neighbour, and that private rights must be subservient to the general interests of the community. An ordinance of a city passed in pursuance of legislative authority, establishing fire limits and declaring that a wooden roof put on a building thereafter within the fire limits to be a nuisance, and requiring the city marshal, under an order from the mayor, to remove the same, is reasonable exercise of the police power of the state, and has the force and effect of a statute when set up in justification by the marshal in removing such a roof.\nAs to the rent:\nThe loss of the use of the building during the time the damage was being repaired, was the direct and immediate result of defendant's act, and though damages may not be recoverable as rent, or rent as rent recoverable as damages, I know no better way of establishing the exact amount of the damage sustained, than by shewing the actual amount that the plaintiff (but for the defendant's wrongful act) would have received from the occupation of the building during the time reasonably required to repair the injury (in this case the actual time it took to repair was shewn), and as defendant offered no evidence on this point to shew that the amount claimed and found by the jury was unreasonable or in excess of the actual loss, and did not raise any question for the jury in relation thereto, though the judge offered to submit to them any question on which counsel might desire to take their opinion, I can see no reason why the jury should not, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, adopt the actual loss of rent as a fair criterion by which to establish the actual amount of the damage sustained as the legal and natural consequence of defendant's wrongful act, and to enable plaintiff to recover for such loss as was proved to be the direct result of the wrong to be redressed.\nThe appeal will therefore be dismissed, but inasmuch as the damages claimed in the declaration amount only to $5,000, and as the amount found by the jury was in excess of that sum, and as the declaration has not been amended, the verdict can only be entered for $5,000.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis action was brought originally against the defendant Walker and one Spears, and judgment in the court below was against them both, and both appealed. Upon the argument before us it appeared to us that there was really nothing to support the judgment as against Spears, and this being admitted by the learned counsel for the respective parties, it was agreed that a nolle prosequi as to Spears should be entered in the court below, and that the case should be treated here as the appeal of Walker against a judgment rendered against himself alone.\nThe point arising for adjudication, without setting out the lengthy pleadings spread upon the record, may be stated thus:\u2014A and B, being owners of contiguous lots of land, purposing to erect houses on their respective lots, agree with each other that there shall be erected on the line between their lots a party wall common to both buildings, the erection of which A assumes; and they respectively enter into written contracts with C for the completion of the mason's work of their respective buildings. By the contract between B and C the latter agreed to furnish all the materials, labor, tools, machinery, &c., and to build, finish, and complete for B a building as described in certain specifications set out in the contract, according to plans and drawings in the specifications referred to, which plans, drawings and specifications were declared to be part of the contract.\nBy the 4th article, it was provided that the contractor should in all cases be his own judge as to the amount of diligence and care required for the proper execution of the various constructions.\nBy the 5th, it was declared that B had engaged John C. Babcock (an architect) as superintendent of the erection and completion of the said buildings; his duty being faithfully to enforce all the conditions of the contract, and to furnish all necessary drawings and information to properly illustrate the design given; also to make estimate for the contractor of the amounts due to him on the contract, in no case estimating any materials or work which are objectionable, or have not become permanent parts of the work, and when the building is completed to issue a certificate to the contractor, which certificate, if unconditional, shall be an acceptance of the contract, and shall release him from all further responsibility on account of the work.\nBy the 6th, it was declared that the building or work should be entirely at the risk of the contractor until the same should be accepted, and that the contractor should be held liable for its safety to the amount of the money paid by B on account of the same.\nBy the 7th, it was provided that in case of any unusual or unnecessary delay or inability by the contractor in providing and delivering the necessary materials, and performing the necessary labor at the time the same is required, so as to insure the completion and delivery of the building or work at the time hereinafter set forth and contracted; then and in such case the proprietor, within three days after having notified the contractor of his intention so to do, shall have the right to enter upon the work and procure such necessary materials or labor to be furnished or performed as the case may require, and remove from the same all defective materials or workmanship, as in the judgment of the superintendent may be found necessary, and carry on the work to completion in such way as shall be proper and right, charging the cost thereof to the contractor and deducting such charges from the amount of the contract price.\n8th. The proprietor reserves the right, by conferring with the superintending architect, to alter and modify the plans, and this specification in particular; and the architect shall be at liberty to make any deviation in the construction, detail or execution, without in either case invalidating or rendering void the contract, and in case such alteration or deviation shall increase or diminish the cost of doing the work the amount to be allowed to the contractor or proprietor shall be such as may be equitable and just.\n9th. The contractor is to co-operate with the contractors for the other parts of the work, so that, as a whole, the job shall be a finished and complete one of its kind, and he is to arrange and carry on his work in such a manner that any of the co-operating contractors shall not be hindered or delayed at any time; and when his part of the work is finished, he shall remove from the premises all tools, machinery, debris, &c., and so far as he is concerned, leave the job clear and free from all obstructions or hindrances.\nWhile both buildings were still in course of erection by C, a centre wall of B's house fell, either by reason of the persons employed by C not having built that wall upon rock foundation as was required by the plans and specifications\u2014a fact which did not become known to B. or his architect until after the wall fell\u2014or by reason of sand to be used on the building having been brought by persons employed by G on to the floor of B's building so in course of erection, and having become saturated with rain and too heavy for the floor to bear, and the falling wall taking with it the floor upon which the sand was so deposited, brought with it the party wall erected by C under his contract with A, in which A and B were mutually interested, thereby damaging also the front wall of A's building erected for him by C under his contract. In such a case will an action lie at the suit of A against B for the damage so done to the party wall in which A and B. are so mutually interested, and to the front wall of A's building so in course of erection? And can A recover from B monies paid by A to C for re-erecting and restoring the party wall and other wall so damaged? or other damages alleged to have accrued to A by reason of his not having had his building completed ready for occupation at the time at which it might have been completed if B.'s wall so erected by C had not fallen, and, in falling, done the damage aforesaid? At the trial there was much evidence given attributing the falling of the centre wall of B's building to the weight of the sand piled upon the floor of the building, and other evidence, which attributed the fall to the fact of the wall not having been built, as required by the plans and specifications, upon rock foundation. At the close of the case, the learned counsel for the defendant moved for a non-suit upon the ground that the action did not lie against B\u2014that he was not responsible for the neglect, default or misconduct of the persons employed by C, the contractor, such persons not being servants of B.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried refused to nonsuit the plaintiff upon the ground that, as he held, articles 5 and 8 of the contract, quoted above, had the effect in law of making the defendant responsible, as retaining control by his architect to receive or reject what was proper or what improper work, and that therefore it became a duty imposed upon the defendant to take care that the work was properly executed according to the specifications\u2014that it was the duty of the architect, acting for the proprietor of the building and engaged by him, to take care that the work was properly done, and that if the work was improperly done, the defendant, having taken control over the contractor, rendered himself liable in law as a party to the act and injury sustained by the plaintiff; and he so charged the jury; and he added that if they should think that the wall fell from not having been built upon the rock, as required by the contract, they must find for the plaintiff. The jury found for the plaintiff.\nIn the following term a motion was made upon behalf of the defendant for a nonsuit, or for a new trial, upon several grounds stated, and among others, for misdirection in the learned judge having directed the jury as above, and a rule nisi was granted, which, after argument, was discharged.\nIt is against the rule discharging the rule nisi that this appeal is taken, and I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, and that the rule in the court below must be made absolute for a new trial.\nThe ruling of the learned judge before whom the case was tried, on the motion for a nonsuit and his charge to the jury cannot, in my opinion, be upheld consistently with a sound application of the principle which is recognized in modern times as governing the case, both in the decisions of the English courts and in those of the courts of the United States.\nIn Bush v. Steinman (1799)[16], where A, having a house by the roadside, contracted with B to repair it for a stipulated sum, and B contracted with C to do the work, and C with D to furnish the materials, and the servant of D brought a quantity of lime to the house and placed it on the road, by which the plaintiff's carriage was overturned, it was held that A was answerable to the plaintiff for the damage sustained. C. J. Eyre, before whom the case was tried, was of opinion at the trial that the action was not maintainable; and although after argument he yielded to the opinion of his brothers in holding that the action was maintainable, he confesses his inability to state upon what precise principle it can be supported. Heath, J., founded his judgment upon the single ground that all the sub-contracting parties were in the employ of the defendant, and he illustrates the case by an obiter dictum which he lays down, namely, that:\nWhere a person hires a coach upon a job, and a job coachman is sent with it, the person who hires the coach is liable for any mischief done by the coachman while in his employ, although he is not his servant.\nAnd Rooke, X, rests his judgment upon the position taken by him, namely: that he who has work going on for his own benefit, on his own premises, must be civilly answerable for the acts of those whom he employs. The case, then, comes not recommended by any concurrence of opinion of the learned judges by whom it was decided in the principle upon which their judgment can be supported.\nIn Laugher v. Pointer (1826)[17], where the owner of a carriage hired of a stable keeper a pair of horses to draw it for a day, and the owner of the horses provided a driver, through whose negligent driving an injury was done to a horse belonging to the plaintiff, the latter, having brought an action for such injury against the owner of the carriage, was non-suited by Abbott, C. J., and upon argument, the court being divided, the non-suit was maintained. In that case, Littledale, X, who concurred with the C. J., that the action did not lie, and the C. J. both repudiate the obiter dictum pronounced by Heath, X in Bush v. Steinman; while Holroyd and Bailey, J. J., who maintained that the action did lie, did so upon the ground that, as they held, the driver of the horses while engaged in driving the defendant was the servant of the defendant, and that so the maxim respondeat superior applied. And Littledale, J., for the purpose of showing that Bush V. Steinman had no application to Laugher v. Pointer, points out the fact which had been relied upon by Rooke, X, as the ground of his judgment, that in Bush V. Steinman the injury was done upon or near, and in respect of the property of the defendant, of which he was in possession at the time, and granting that the rule of law may be that in all cases where a man is in possession of fixed property he must take care that his property is so used and managed that other persons are not injured, and that whether his property be managed by his own immediate servants, or by contractors and their servants, that had no application to Laugher v. Pointer. He does not express his opinion to be that there is any such rule of law, but assuming there to be such a rule, the judgment in Bush v. Steinman was not a binding authority in Laugher v. Pointer, and as to that judgment he points out its weakness by reference to the doubt expressed by Eyre, C. J., as to what principle could be urged in its support, and he proceeds to show that Bush v. Steinman was mainly grounded upon Littledale v. Lord Lonsdale[18], which was a clear case of master and servant, and Leslie v. Pounds[19], in which the defendant's liability was put upon the ground of his having personally interfered in the superintendence of the repairs which were being done to his house by his tenant, in whose occupation the house was, and at whose cost and charges the repairs were being made, in the progress of which the plaintiff received injury. Whatever, then, may be the ground upon which Bush v. Steinman may be sought to be supported, the judgment in that case acquires no confirmation from Laugher v. Pointer.\nIn Randleson v. Murray (1838)[20], where a warehouseman employed a master porter to remove a barrel from his warehouse, the master porter employed his own men and tackle, and through negligence of the men the tackle failed, and the barrel fell and injured the plaintiff, it was held that the warehouseman was liable in case for the injury. It is to be observed that in this case the learned counsel for the defendant admitted that Bush v. Steinman had been questioned, and contended only that the defendant would be liable, if the master porter and his men could be considered as the servants of the defendant and the case was decided upon the ground, that they clearly were so under the circumstances of that case. Lord Denman, C. J., says:\u2014\nHad the jury in this case been asked whether the porters, whose negligence occasioned the accident, were the servants of the defendant, there can be no doubt they would have found in the affirmative.\nThat case then proceeded upon the principle that the master is responsible for the tort of his servant, wholly irrespective of the fact that the premises upon which the tort was committed was the property of the defendant.\nIn Quarman v. Burnett (1840)[21], the very point which was raised in Laugher v. Pointer was decided in accordance with the opinions of Littledale, J., and Abbott, C. J., as given in that case, notwithstanding that, as pointed out by Littledale, J., in his judgment in Laugher v. Pointer, there might be a rule of law that where a man is in possession of fixed property he must take care that his property is so used and managed that other persons are not injured, and that whether his property be managed by his own immediate servants or by contractors with them or their servants; but the court does not lay down that there is any such rule of law so that the dictum of Rooke, J., in Bush v. Steinman, that there is such a rule, has acquired no confirmation or force from the judgment in Quarman v. Burnett.\nIn Milligan v. Wedge (1840)[22], the Court of Queen's Bench, approving and following the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, in Quarman v. Burnett, held, where the buyer of a bullock employed a licensed drover to drive it from Smithfield, and the drover employed a boy to drive it to the owner's slaughterhouse, and mischief was occasioned by the bullock through the careless driving of the boy, that the owner of the bullock was not liable for the injury, for the reason that the boy was not in point of law his servant. Lord Denman, C. J., in this case takes the opportunity of casting a doubt upon that portion of Quarman v. Burnett referring to the judgment of Littledale, J., as to the distinction in cases of fixed property which Rooke, J., had relied upon as the foundation of his judgment in Bush v. Steinman. He says:\nI think we are bound by the late decision in Quarman v. Burnett which was pronounced after full consideration. It may be another question whether I should agree in all the remarks delivered from the bench in that case. If I felt any doubt it would be whether the distinction as to the law in the cases of fixed and of movable property can be relied upon.\nWilliams, J., then says the difficulty always is to say whose servant the person is that does the injury; when you decide that, the question is solved. To say that that party is liable from whom the act ultimately originates is indeed a rule of great generality, and one which will solve the greater number of questions, but its applicability fails in one case.; For where the person who does the injury exercises an independent employment the party employiug him is clearly not liable. And Coleridge, J., says, the true test is to ascertain the relation between the party charged and the party actually doing the injury; unless the relation of master and servant exists between them the act of the one creates no liability in the other. This case did not raise for judicial decision the question whether the injury being done on property which was the fixed real property of the defendant, would make the owner liable irrespective of the existence of the relation of master and servant between him and the person who is directly the cause of the injury; but the principle upon which an action of this nature is maintainable against a person not directly the cause of the injury is so clearly placed upon the existence of the relation of master and servant as plainly to cast a doubt upon the correctness of the principle as to the injury occurring upon fixed property of the defendant, which Rooke, J., relied upon in Bush v. Steinman as the foundation of his judgment.\nIn Rapson v. Cubitt (1842)[23], the defendant, a builder, was employed by the committee of a club to execute certain alterations at the club house, including the preparation and fixing of gas fittings. He made a subcontract with B, a gas-fitter, to execute this part of the work. In the course of doing it, through B's negligence, the gas exploded and injured the plaintiff, and it was held that the defendant was not liable, upon the ground that the person whose negligence had directly caused the injury did not stand in the relation of a servant to the defendant, but was a sub-contractor. Lord Abinger, C. B., says:\nI think the true principle of law, consistent with common sense, was laid down in the case of Quarman v. Burnett, in which all previous cases on this subject were cited and considered, and some distinguished and some overuled.\nIt is true that Parke, B, in that case distinguishes it from Bush v. Steinman in the language used by Littledale, J., in Laugher v. Pointer. In Burgess v. Gray (1845)[24], B, the owner and occupier of premises adjoining a highway, employed C to make a drain therefrom to communicate with the common sewer. In the performance of the work the workman employed by C placed gravel on the highway, in consequence of which A, in driving along the road, sustained personal injury. Before the accident the dangerous portion of the heap was pointed out to B, who promised to remove it, and B was held liable to A. Bush v. Steinman was relied upon by the plaintiff's counsel, as also were the observations in relation to it made by Littledale, J, and Parke, B., in the above cases. Sergeant Byles, on the contrary, for the defendant, insisted that Bush v. Steinman was not law, and that the sole test of liability was to enquire whether the relation of master and servant existed. The court in pronouncing judgment seem to take special care to avoid resting their judgment upon Bush v. Steinman. Tindal, C. J., says:\nThe only question in this case is, whether there was any evidence to leave to the jury? The matter left for the consideration of the jury on this declaration was whether or not the defendant wrongfully put and placed or caused to be put and placed in a large heap or mound great quantities of earth, gravel, &c., upon a certain highway, and so caused the accident of which the plaintiff complained.\nand he adds:\nI think there was evidence to leave to the jury in support of that charge. If indeed, this had been the simple case of a contract entered into between Gray and Palmer, that the latter should make the drain and remove the earth and rubbish, and there had been no personal superintendence or interference on the part of the former, I should have said it fell within the principle contended for by my brother Byles, and that the damage should be made good by the contractor, and not by the individual for whom the work was done.\nHe then goes through the evidence showing the evidence from which the jury were justified in concluding that the defendant had actually interfered in causing the dirt to be heaped where it was, and that it was, in fact, placed there with the defendant's consent, if not by his express direction, and Cresswell, J., going through the evidence in like manner, comes to the conclusion that there was abundant evidence to show that the defendant at least sanctioned the placing of the nuisance on the road, and that therefore he was responsible for its consequences. Now, this case is a clear enunciation of the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas, that if an owner of fixed property enters into a contract with an independent contractor for work to be done upon the property, the proprietor is not liable because of his being owner of the property, to a third person, for injury arising to him from an act or default of a person employed by the contractor, nor unless there be evidence of the proprietor having himself personally interfered by authorizing or sanctioning the very act or default which was the cause of the injury. It is therefore in antagonism with the principle enunciated by Rooke, X, as the foundation upon which he rested his judgment in Bush v. Steinman. In Allen v. Hayward (1845)[25] the Court of Queen's Bench, referring to the above quoted cases, say:\nIt seems perfectly clear that in an ordinary case the contractor to do work of this description is not to be considered as a servant, but a person carrying on an independent business, such as the commissioners were fully justified in employing to perform works which they could not execute for themselves, and who was known to all the world as performing them. We find here none of the reasons which have prevailed in cases where one person has been held liable for the acts of another as his servant. The doubt is raised by the contract which expressly requires that all such parts of the said work to be done by Butten (the contractor) as are not in particular manner specified and described in the contract, or the plans and specifications, shall be executed in such manner as the surveyor of the said works for the time being shall direct, and in a good and workmanlike manner. * * * This passage of the agreement would appear to take power from the contractor and keep it in the hands of the commissioners or their surveyor; but whatever may be its proper construction or effect, it has no application to the present case, for the bank which failed is part of the works so specified and described, and for which, therefore, if ill done, the contractor is liable, and not the commissioners.\nIn Reedie v. London & North Western Railway, Co. and Hobbitt v. the same (1849)[26], where the company, empowered by act of parliament to construct a railway, contracted under seal with certain persons to make a portion of the line, and by the contract reserved to themselves the power of dismissing any of the contractor's workmen for incompetence, it was held that the company were not responsible to the administrator of a person passing along a highway who had been killed by the negligence of a workman employed in constructing a bridge over the highway for the company under the contract, and that the terms of the contract made no difference.\nRolfe, B., pronouncing the judgment of the court, referring particularly to the distinction drawn between fixed property and moveable chattels, and pointing out that the circumstances of Laugher v. Pointer or of Quarman v. Burnett were not such as to make it necessary to overrule Bush v. Steinman, says:\nOn full consideration, we have come to the conclusion that there is no such distinction unless perhaps in cases where the act complained of is such as to amount to a nuisance, and, in fact, that according to the modern decisions Bush v. Steinman must be taken not to be law.\nand he proceeds to say that, if the owner of real property be responsible in any cases for nuisances occasioned by the mode in which his property is used by others not standing in the relation of servants to him or part of his family, the liability must be founded on the principle that he has not taken due care to prevent the doing of acts which it was his duty to prevent, whether done by his servants or others, but such principle could not apply to the wrongful act which caused the injury in the case before the court, which could in no possible sense be treated as a nuisance, for that it was a single act of negligence, and that in such a case there is no principle for making any distinction by reason of the negligence having arisen in reference to real and not to personal property, and referring to the observations of Littledale, J., in Laugher v. Pointer, that the law does not recognize a several liability in two principals who are unconnected, if they are jointly liable; you may sue either, but you cannot have two separately liable, he says:\nThis doctrine is one of general application irrespective of the nature of the employment, and applying the principle to the present case it would be impossible to hold the present defendants liable without at the same time deciding that the contractors are not liable, which it would be impossible to be contended.\nThis last observation seems to be the logical conclusion necessarily deducible from the liability in cases like the present being made to depend upon the relation of the master and servant and the maxim respondeat superior, for it is plain that a workman employed by, and the servant of, an independent contractor can no more be said to be the servant of the contractor and his employer jointly than he can be the servant of the employer alone, there could, therefore, be no joint liability of the contractor and the employer. If there was, the defendants in the above case might have been sued alone. Then as to the terms of the contract, Rolfe, B., says:\nOur attention was directed during the argument to the provisions of the contract whereby the defendants had the power of insisting on the removal of careless or incompetent workmen, and so it was contended they must be responsible for their non-removal, but this power of removal does not appear to us to vary the case; the workman is still the servant of the contractor only, and the fact that the defendants might have insisted on his removal, if they thought him careless or unskillful, did not make him their servant.\nHence it follows that the control, which, being retained by an employer of work done upon his premises, over the work, which would make him liable as the superior, upon the principle which governs in cases of this kind, must be such a control as to make the person actually causing the injury the servant of the person sought to be charged; the supervision of an architect in the ordinary discharge of the duties of his profession to see justice done by the contractor to their joint principal can never make that principal liable for the negligence of the person standing in relation of servant to the contractor alone.\nIn Knight v. Fox (1850)[27], where a railway company had entered into a contract with A to construct a portion of their line, and A contracted with B to erect a bridge on the line, and B entered into a contract with C (who acted as the surveyor and manager of B's business in London at an annual salary), by which C agreed to erect for \u00a340 a scaffold which was necessary for the building of the bridge, the scaffold was erected upon the footway by C's workmen and a portion of it improperly projected, by reason of which D fell and was injured. It was held that B was not liable to D, for that the act of C was not done by him in the character of servant of B. There Alderson, B., says:\nThe real question and the only one, is whether the negligent act by which the injury was occasioned to the plaintiff, was the act of C as the defendant's servant; but the evidence shows that when the negligent act was occasioned by C he was acting in the character of a sub-contractor, and that he did the work on his own individual account. The plaintiff's remedy is against C.\nIn Overton v. Freeman (1851)[28], A had contracted with parish officers to pave a certain district, and entered into a sub-contract with B, under which the latter was to lay down the paving of a street, the materials being furnished by A and brought to the spot in his carts; preparatory to the paving, the stones were laid by laborers employed by B on the pathway and there left unguarded at night in such a manner as to obstruct the same, and C fell over them and broke his leg, and it was held that B, and not A, was responsible to C.\nIn giving judgment, Cresswell, J., there says:\nIt seems to me that the modern cases of Rapson v. Cubitt; Reedie v. The London & N. W. Rwy. Co. and Knight v. Fox are conclusive. In Reedie v. The London & N. W. Railway Company, Rolfe B. delivering the judgment of the court says: The liability of any one other than the party actually guilty of any wrongful act proceeds on the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se; the party employing has the selection of the party employed, and it is reasonable that he who has made choice of an unskilful or careless person to execute his orders should be responsible for any injury resulting from the want of skill or care of the person employed, but neither the principle of the rule nor the rule itself can apply to a case where the party sought to be charged does not stand in the character of employer to the party by whose negligent act the injury has been occasioned.\nAnd Williams, J., says:\nThis is not the case of master and servant, but of contractor and sub-contractor, The plaintiff's counsel has rested his argument upon a broad and intelligent ground, viz: that the act complained of is a public nuisance. Some of the cases, it is true, would seem to justify the distinction, but it seems to me we cannot give any weight to it without overruling Knight v. Fox.\nAnd upon this point Cresswell, J., added that\nIf indeed the act contracted to be done would itself have been a public nuisance of course the defendant would have been responsible.\nIn Peachey v. Rowland et al (1853)[29], A employed B to construct a drain from certain houses of A's across a public highway. B employed C to fill in the earth over the brickwork and to carry away the surplus, C, in performing this work, left the earth raised so much above the level of the road that D, driving in the dark, was thereby upset and sustained injury, and it was held that A was not responsible to D for the negligence of C. Maule, J., in giving the judgment of the court, says:\nIt would be extremely inconvenient if this case could be successfully distinguished from Overton v. Freeman, which proceeded upon the decision of the Court of Exchequer in Knight v. Fox; the true result of the evidence here was that the defendants had nothing whatever to do with the wrongful act complained of; they employed somebody to do something which might be done, either in a proper or an improper manner, and he did it in a negligent and improper manner, and injury resulted to the plaintiff. I am of opinion that if the jury had, upon this evidence, found that the defendants did the wrong complained of, their verdict would have been set aside as not warranted by the evidence; there was, in truth, no evidence for the practical purpose in hand.\nHe adds:\nThe rule is very well stated by Rolfe, B., in Reedie v. L. & N. W. Ry. Co.[30]\nIn Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Co. (1853)[31], it was held that the Gas Company who had no right to open the streets of Sheffield, and the opening of which was a public nuisance, could not shield themselves from responsibility to a person receiving injury from the nuisance by shewing that the nuisance was committed under a contract entered into by the company with contractors for that purpose. Lord Campbell, C. J., there says:\nI am clearly of opinion that if the contractor does the thing which he is employed to do, the employer is responsible for that thing as if he did it himself, affirming the principle stated by Cresswell, J., in Overton v. Freeman.\nAnd Erle, J., says:\nThe cause of the accident was the very thing done in pursuance of the specific directions of the defendants contained in their contract, and that, in my opinion, makes the distinction between the present case and those cited in which the cause of the accident was the negligence of those doing the thing, not the thing itself.\nAnd in Sadler v. Henlock (1855)[32], where the defendant was held liable, upon the ground that the person who caused the injury there complained of, by digging through a public highway, was the servant of the defendant, Lord Campbell points out that Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Co., which was relied upon by the plaintiff, had no application, for it proceeded on the ground that the act done there could not be done at all without committing a public nuisance, which the person committing it was employed by the defendants to commit, whereas in Sadler v. Henlock the drain which was being cleansed might have been cleansed without the committing of any nuisance; and he, therefore, puts the case then before him upon its true principle, namely, the relation of master and servant, and Wightman, J., says:\nThe question is whether. Pearson (the laborer who did the work) is to be considered as the defendant's servant or as a contractor exercising an independent employment; the whole evidence is that the former is the correct view.\nIn Steel v. The South Eastern Railway Co. (1855)[33], it was held that where work is done for a railway company under a contract, parol or otherwise, the company are not responsible for injury resulting to a third person from the negligent manner of doing the work, though they employ their own surveyor to superintend it, and to direct what shall be done.\nCresswell, J., there says there was no evidence that could properly be left to a jury to show that the defendants or their servants had been guilty of any such negligence as to make them responsible. He says:\nIf it could have been shown that that plaintiff's land was flooded in consequence of something done by the orders of the company's surveyor it might have been said that was the same as if the surveyor had done it with his own hands, and then the company would have been responsible.\nAnd Crowder, J., says:\nThe only persons responsible for the acts complained of are Furness or Eaves, the circumstance of the work being done by Furness under a contract negatives his being a servant of the company. The evidence of Eaves showed that he was acting quite independently of the company, though receiving orders from their surveyor; there clearly was no evidence to fix the defendants.\nIn Hole v. Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway Co. (1861)[34], where a railway company were authorized by their Act of Parliament to construct a railway bridge across a navigable river, and the Act provided that it should not be lawful to detain any vessel navigating the river for a longer time than sufficient to enable any carriages, animals, or passengers ready to traverse, to cross the bridge and for opening it to admit such vessel, the defendants employed a contractor to construct the bridge in conformity with the provisions of the Act of Parliament, but before the works were completed the bridge, from some defect in its construction, could not be opened, and the plaintiff's vessel was prevented from navigating the river; it was held that the railway company was responsible for the damage thereby caused to the plaintiff, upon the authority of Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Co., because the very thing which was contracted to be done for the company, namely, the erection of the bridge, was the thing which caused the obstruction and nuisance of which the plaintiff complained as obstructing his right to navigate the river, contrary to the express terms of the Act of Parliament, in virtue of which alone the railway company had any right to erect the bridge.\nPollock, C. B., says:\nThere is a wide difference between a liability arising from the relation of master and servant, and that which exists in the present case. The defendants are authorized by Act of Parliament to construct certain works, and they cannot transfer that authority to another person without being responsible for the proper execution of them. This is a case in which the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se applies.\nAnd he adds:\nWhere a person is authorized by act of Parliament or bound by contract to do a particular work, he cannot avoid responsibility by contracting with another person to do the work.\nThen quoting what was said by Lord Campbell in Ellis v. The Gas Co., that where the contractor does the thing which he is employed to do, the employer is responsible for that thing as if he had done it himself, he says:\nHere the contractor was employed to make a bridge, and he did make a bridge which obstructed the navigation, so causing the injury complained of;\nand he proceeds to draw the distinction between the thing itself contracted to be done causing the injury, and injury caused by an act arising incidentally in the course of the performance of the work contracted for, that is to say, between the thing itself contracted for, causing the mischief, and mischief arising only from the manner in which a thing in itself innocuous, if properly constructed, is constructed. He says:\nWhere the act complained of is purely collateral and arises incidentally in the course of the performance of the work, the employer is not liable, because he never authorized that act, the remedy is against the person who did it; that, however, generally affords but a poor compensation to the party injured, for the wrong doer is usually a common workman. Then comes the enquiry, who is the master?\u2014the contractor. In such case the employer is not responsible; but when the contractor is employed to do a particular act the doing of which produces mischief, another doctrine applies. Here the legislature empowered the company to build the bridge; in building that bridge the contractor erected an obstruction to the navigation, and for that the company are liable.\nThat the principle applied to the determination of this case has no application to the case now before us appears from the judgment of the same court in Butler v. Hunter (1862)[35], which was decided by the same judges as had decided Hole v. Sittingbourne and S. Ry. Co.\nThe plaintiff and defendant being owners of adjoining ancient houses, it became necessary for the defendant, in consequence of a fire, to repair his house, and he employed an architect to superintend the making the repairs. The architect having considered it necessary to pull down and rebuild the front wall, agreed with a contractor to do the work for an estimated price, and the workmen of the contractor, in pulling down the wall, removed a brest-summer which was inserted in the party wall between the defendant's and plaintiff's house without taking any precautions by shoring or otherwise, in consequence of which the front wall of plaintiff's house fell, and it was held that the contractor and not the defendant was the person responsible to the plaintiff for that injury.\nMartin, B., says:\nThe contractor's negligence in removing the brest-summer caused the plaintiff's wall to fall. When a person employs a builder to do certain work and he does it negligently, the employer is not liable unless he personally interferes.\nAnd again,\nThe relation of master and servant must exist before any other person can be made responsible than the person who did the act which caused the mischief.\nPollock, C. B., says:\nThe argument of Mr. Denman amounts to this: That where a person employs a tradesman to do work which may be dangerous to another, he is bound to show that he directed all care to be taken and specifically pointed out in what way the danger was to be guarded against; or, at all events, to show that he did enough to exempt himself from responsibility. No doubt where the act is in itself a nuisance. And this term nuisance is to be read in the sense declared by Parke, B., in Knight v. Fox, to be attributed to the same term in Reddie L. & N. W. Ry. Co., namely, a private nuisance as connected with a man's house or fixed property. The party who employs another to do it is responsible for all the consequences, for there the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se applies, but where the mischief arises not from the act itself, but the improper mode in which it is done, the person who ordered it is not responsible, unless the relation of master and servant exists.\nAnd Wilde, B., says:\nIt seems to me the case is very plain. Hole v. S. S. Ry. Co. is distinguishable. There it is said that where the act itself has caused the injury, the person who ordered it is responsible, but where the injury happened from something collateral in the course of carrying out the order, he is not responsible.\nAnd, again, as to the fact of the defendant having employed an architect, he says:\nIn the case of almost every house that is built the owner employs an architect.; the architect employs a builder, and the builder employs workmen, but the owner of the house is not responsible for the negligence of the workmen.\nPickard v. Smith (1861)[36] proceeds upon the same principle as that which was involved in Ellis v. Gas Co. and Hole v. S. & S. Ry. Co. Williams, J., pronouncing the judgment of the court, puts the case thus:\nIf an independent contractor is employed to do a lawful act, and in the course of the work he or his servants commit some casual act of wrong or negligence, the employer is not responsible. That rule is, however, inapplicable to cases in which the act which occasions the injury is one which the contractor was employed to do; and by parity of reasoning to cases in which the contractor is entrusted with a duty incumbent upon his employer and neglects its fulfilment whereby an injury is occasioned, which was the case before the court.\nIn Bower v. Peate (1876)[37], where plaintiff and defendant were respective owners of two adjoining houses, and plaintiff's house was entitled to the support of defendant's soil, and the defendant employed a contractor to pull down his house, excavate the foundations close to plaintiff's wall and rebuild defendant's house, it was held that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for injury occasioned to his wall by reason of the means taken by the contractor to prevent the injury having been insufficient, upon the principle, as stated by Cockburn, C.J., delivering the judgment of the court\u2014that\nA man who orders a work to be executed from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences to his neighbour must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented, is bound to see to the doing of that which is necessary to prevent the mischief, and cannot relieve himself from responsibility by employing some one else to do what is necessary to prevent the act he has ordered to be done from becoming wrongful.\nIn that case injury to the plaintiff was, in the natural course of things, to be expected to follow from the excavation ordered to be made by defendant for his house unless the plaintiff's house should be properly shored up during the progress of the excavation for and the building of defendant's house; the defendant, under these circumstances, owed the duty to the plaintiff involved in the maxim Sic utere tuo ut alienum non l\u00e6das, and so apparent was the danger to plaintiff's property that the defendant took a covenant of indemnity from the contractor.\nBetween such a case and the case now before us there is a manifest distinction, as was pointed out by Cockburn, C. J., in pronouncing judgment against the defendant in the above case, at p. 326, where he says:\nThere is an obvious difference between committing work to a contractor to be executed, from which, if properly done, no injurious consequences can arise, and handing over to him work to be done from which mischievous consequences will arise unless preventive measures a adopted, while it may be just to hold the party authorizing the work in the former case exempt from liability from injury resulting from negligence which he had no reason to anticipate, there is, on the other hand, good ground for holding him liable for injury caused by an act certain to be attended with injurious consequences if such consequences are not in fact prevented, no matter through whose default the omission to take the necessary measures such prevention may a e.\nButler v. Hunter was not cited, not because the learned counsel who argued Bower v. Peate may be assumed to have been ignorant of it, but because, as I think, it had no application to the question arising in Bower v. Peate, which was rested upon a wholly different principle than that governing Butler v. Hunter, namely, on the principle involved in Ellis v. The Gas Co., Hole v. S. & S. Rwy. Co., Pickard v. Smith, and Grey v. Rullen, while Butler v. Hunter comes within that class of cases which is contrasted by Cockburn, C.J., in principle with the principle governing Bower v. Peate. The defendant in Butler v. Hunter, so far as appeared in evidence, was in the position of a man who had simply authorized and contracted for the execution of a work from which, if executed with due care and in a proper manner, no injury was or could reasonably have been anticipated, and who, therefore, was not responsible, because of injury having arisen in the progress of the work from the negligence of the contractor or his servants; whereas, in Bower v. Peate the injury which did happen was naturally to be expected to happen as the direct and immediate consequence of the work ordered by the defendant to be done unless special care should be taken to prevent its happening; and the probability of the occurrence of the injury was so apparent that the defendant required the contractor to indemnify the defendant in case it should happen. This view is confirmed, as it appears to me, by what fell from the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, and in the House of Lords upon this point in the recent case of Angus v. Dalton[38]. That case was identical in its circumstances with Bower v. Peate, and was determined wholly, so far as this point is concerned, upon the authority of Bower v. Peate.\nLord Justice Thesiger, in Angus v. Dalton[39], says:\nIt is properly admitted by the defendant's counsel that the case of Bower v. Peate is undistinguishable from the present, and I am of opinion that the law there laid down by the Lord Chief Justice in delivering the considered judgment of the court is correctly stated and placed upon proper principles, and that the defendants in the present case who have ordered work to be executed from which in the natural course of things injurious consequences to the plaintiff's factory might be expected to arise unless means to prevent them were adopted, are, if the plaintiffs are entitled to recover at all, responsible for the damage which has in fact arisen owing to the means adopted having proved to be insufficient.\nAnd Lord Justice Cotton, at p. 188, says:\nI agree with the decision in Bower v. Peate, that where a defendant has employed a contractor to do work, which in its nature is dangerous to a neighboring property and damage is the result of the work done, the employer is liable, though he has employed a competent contractor and given him directions to take precautions in executing the work.\nAnd in the House of Lords[40], Lord Blackburn says:\nEver since Quarman v. Burnett, it has been considered settled law that one employing another is not liable for his collateral negligence unless the relation of master and servant existed between them, so that a person employing a contractor to do work is not liable for the negligence of that contractor or his servants. On the other hand, a person causing something to be done, the doing of which casts on him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching on him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to a contractor.\nAnd at p. 831, Lord Watson says:\nThe operations of the commissioners were obviously attended with danger to the building in question. * * * When an employer contracts for the performance of work which, properly conducted, can occasion no risk to his neighbour's house, which he is under obligation to support, he is not liable for damage arising from the negligence of the contractor, but in cases where the work is necessarily attended with risk, he cannot free himself from liability by binding the contractor to take effectual precautions.\nThe courts in the United States have adopted the law upon the subject as expounded by the English courts. In Blake v. Ferris (1851), the Court of Appeals of the state of New York[41], reviewing all the English cases up to that time, came to the conclusion that Bush v. Steinman was not law in England, or in the State of New York, and they held that persons who, having a license from the proper authorities of the city of New York to construct at their own expense a sewer from their house into the public street, engaged a contractor to construct it at a stipulated price for the whole work, were not liable to third persons for any injury resulting from the negligent manner in which the sewer was left at night by the workmen employed by the contractor, upon the ground that the contractor or his servants were not servants of the defendants. In Barry v. The city of St. Louis (1852)[42], the Court of Appeals of the State of Missouri, after a like review of all the English cases, came to a like conclusion as to Bush v. Steinman, and held that the defendants, who had entered into a contract with a contractor for the construction of a sewer, whereby the contractor covenanted for a consideration agreed upon to furnish all materials and do all the work, were not responsible to a third person for the negligence of the contractor in not properly guarding the excavation at night, upon the ground that the contractor was not the servant of the defendants, and it was held further that the contract having contained a provision that the work was to be done under the inspection of the city Engineer made no difference. In Pack v. The Mayor, &c., of the city of New York in (1853)[43], the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, following Blake v. Ferris, held the city corporation was not liable for injury to third persons occasioned by negligence of workmen engaged in grading a street under a person who had entered into a contract with the corporation to furnish all the materials, and perform the work in conformity with certain specifications mentioned and described in the contract, and further to conform the work to such further directions as should be given by the Street Commissioner and one of the city Surveyors, and it was further held that this last clause made no difference as it did not change the relation between the parties and constitute the contractor or his servants the servants of the corporation. In Hilliard v. Richardson (1855)[44], the Supreme Court of the State of Massachusetts, reviewing all the English cases to that time, came to the same conclusion as to Bush v. Steinman as the Court of Appeals of the State of New York had in Blake v. Ferris, and held that the owner of land who employs a carpenter for a specific price, to alter and repair a building thereon, and to furnish all the materials for the purpose, is not liable for damages resulting to a third person, from boards deposited on the highway in front of the land by a teamster in the employ of the carpenter, and intended to be used in the repair of the building.\nIn Gilbert v. Beach (1858) the Court of Appeal of the State of New York[45] say the question whether an owner can be held responsible for damages occasioned by the unauthorized act of builder or contractor could not arise in the case until the question of fact, whether the act was or was not authorized by the owner, should be first disposed of and settled, and a new trial was ordered. On the case coming up again[46] the court, following Blake v. Ferris, held that the owner of a lot of ground who has contracted with masons, carpenters and other mechanics of competent skill for the erection of a building thereon in a safe and proper manner, is not responsible to an owner of adjoining property for injury occasioned by water from the defendant's property flooding the plaintiff's cellar, occasioned by the negligence of the servants of the contractor engaged in the prosecution of the work contracted for. Clark, J., in delivering the judgment of the court, referring to Blake v. Ferris, and the principle thereby adopted, says:\nI cannot conceive that it makes any difference when the injury happens to have been committed on the premises of a person sought to be charged, if he had no direct agency in the commission of it, or has not sanctioned it in any way. If the person doing the injury is not his servant but the servant of another, there is no better reason why the latter should be relieved from responsibility than if the injury was committed in the street.\nIn Blackwell v. Wiswall[47] the Supreme Court of the State of New York held the only principle upon which one man can be made liable for the wrongful acts of another to be that\u2014\nSuch a relation exists between them that the former is bound to control the conduct of the latter. The party sought to be charged must stand in the relation of superior to the person whose wrongful act is the ground of complaint.\nIn Storrs v. The City of Utica (1858)[48] the Court of Appeals of the State of New York draws the distinction which exists between injury arising from the work itself authorized to be done, and that which arises from negligence only in the manner of performing the work; and proceeding upon the same principle as the courts in England proceeded in Ellis v. The Gas Co., Hole v. S. and S. Ry. Co., Bower v. Peate, and Angus v. Dalton, held that a municipal corporation, by reason of its owing a duty to the public to keep its streets in a safe conditon for travel, were liable to persons receiving injury from neglect to keep proper lights and guards round an excavation which it had caused to be made in the street, although that excavation was made under a contract entered into with a competent contractor, and that the corporation could not escape responsibility for putting a public street in a dangerous condition for travel at night, by interposing the contract by which they had authorized the very thing which created the danger. Says the court:\nThe danger arises from the very nature of the improvement, and yet can be avoided only by special precautions, such as placing guards or lighting the street. The corporation which has authorized the work is plainly bound to take those precautions.\nThis is the precise principle laid down in Bower v. Peate, and Angus v. Dalton.\nIn Potter v. Seymour (1859)[49], where an owner being about to erect a building on his lot entered into a contract with one Adair, whose business was to put up marble fronts to buildings, to furnish and set the marble for the front thereof agreeably to certain specifications, and the plaintiff passing along the street sustained injury in consequence of the fall of a derrick erected on the top of the building by persons employed by Adair for the purpose of raising the marble, and counsel for the defendant required the learned judge who tried the case to direct the jury\nThat if they should find that a contract had been made with Adair to put up the marble front, and that he was exercising an independent employment under such contract, and the accident was the result of his negligence or that of his servants, the defendant in law was not liable, or that if the negligence of Adair's servants had caused the accident, and the defendant had not the right to choose said servants, the defendant was not liable in law;\nAnd the learned judge refused to give such direction; it was held that by so refusing he had erred, and that he should either have treated the contract with Adair as a defense, or should have left some such question as he was requested by counsel for the defendant to do as above, and a new trial was ordered.\nIn Benedict v. Martin (1862)[50], in an action brought by plaintiff to recover damages for injury done to his property by reason of the falling of a wall which the defendant the owner of the adjoining lot was having built for him under a contract entered into with a competent contractor, the Supreme Court of the State of New York held that the learned judge before whom the case was tried erred in leaving the case to the jury, and in overruling the contention of defendant's counsel that the defendant was not liable, and that plaintiff should be nonsuited, as the persons actually engaged in erecting the wall were servants of the contractor, and not of the defendant, and the court, holding that, as there was no conflict of testimony as to the relation between the defendant and the contractor, there was nothing to leave to the jury, ordered a new trial.\nIn Hunt v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. (1866)[51], the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held, that where a railroad company had contracted with a builder to do the work of a building in a substantial and workmanlike manner, and in accordance with plans, specifications and instructions furnished by the company, the latter were not liable to a third person for injury arising from the negligence of a person employed on the building by the contractor, for that notwithstanding the above provision that the work was to be done in accordance with instructions furnished by the company, the contractor was left to his own skill and judgment as to the mode of accomplishing the work, and he was bound to bring to its execution the degree of skill and care necessary to perform his contract; and the persons to be employed on the work were necessarily to be hired by the contractor, and so were his servants, and not the servants of the company.\nAs to the case of Gorham v. Gross[52], which contains expressions of the court which appear to be in antagonism with the above cases, it is not necessary to express an opinion whether it was well or ill decided, for that case appears to be distinguishable in this that there the masons had completed the wall, and it had been accepted by the defendant as completed in accordance with the contract, from which circumstance it seems to have been considered that there became a duty imposed upon the defendant to maintain it in such a state of efficiency that it should not fall and do damage to neighbouring property. Unless thus distinguishable it appears to be in antagonism with all the above decisions as well of the American as of the English courts.\nNow, in the case before us it appears to me to be clear that the 8th article of the specifications (relied upon by the learned judge who tried this case as subjecting the defendant to liability), whereby the defendant reserved the right by conferring with his architect to be at liberty to make any deviation in the construction, detail or execution without invalidating or rendering void the contract, cannot be construed as having invalidated the contract so far as to make the defendant responsible for the negligence of the contractor's servants, and for which the defendant would not be responsible if the 8th article had not been introduced; that article, (even if what is there contemplated had been done) could not relieve the contractor from the obligation assumed by him of furnishing all materials and labor, of executing the work to be contracted for with due care and skill, and in a perfect manner, and of incurring all risk until completed as was provided in other articles, nor could it be construed to have the effect of altering the relation existing between the defendant and his contractor, or of making the persons employed by the latter to be the servants of the former, but inasmuch as what was contemplated by the 8th article is not claimed to have been ever done, that article can have no bearing whatever upon the question as to the liability of the defendant under the circumstances appearing in evidence.\nThen, as to the 5th article, also relied upon by the learned judge, whereby Babcock is declared to be the defendant's architect for the performance of duties and services usually devolving upon an architect, (duties and services which, as pointed out by Wilde, B., in Butler v. Hunter are called into action in the case of almost every house which is built without making the owner of the house responsible for the negligence of the contractor or his workmen) the appointment of the architect cannot have the effect attributed to it by the learned judge without introducing a wholly new principle governing the liability of one person for injuries caused by the actual negligence of another, not sanctioned by any of the cases in either the English or American courts; and which is expressly repudiated in some of them, notably in Reedie v. L. & N. W. Ry. Co. and Steel v. S. E. Ry. Co., in the English courts, and in Barry v. City of St Louis, Pack v. New York, and Hunt v. Pennsylvania Ry. Co. in the United States courts, and not only is the proposition contended for, not sanctioned by authority, but it cannot, as it appears to me, be reconciled with any principle that a person who, if departing from the universal practice of employing an architect to superintend the erection of a house being built for him under contract with an independent contractor would not be liable for injuries caused by the negligence of the contractor or his servants, would become liable for such injuries by the mere fact of his adopting the universal practice of employing an architect. If there were any such liability no doubt it would have been established by express authority long ago, and would have been alluded to in some of the above cases in which the ground upon which one person can be made liable for the negligence of another is so clearly put upon the relation of master and servant, except in the cases where the thing itself, authorised by a defendant to be done constitutes a nuisance to the property of a neighbour, or where, from the nature of the thing authorised, it is obvious that in the nature of things injury is likely to happen from the execution of the work to the person or property of another, unless special precautions are taken to prevent the injury, in which case a duty becomes imposed upon the person authorizing the work to take all necessary precautions to prevent the injury arising; and this duty is wholly irrespective of all consideration by whom the injury was caused, and whether from the negligence of a contractor or his servants, or whether an architect or superintendent be or be not employed to take measures to prevent the happening of injury from the work authorized. The learned judge then, as it appears to me, erred in ruling that the legal effect of the contract in this case, by reason of its providing for the appointment of an architect to superintend the contractor's work, made the defendant liable to the plaintiff for injury arising from the contractor and his servants being guilty of negligence in the performance of the work and not executing it according to the plans and specifications furnished by the architect, and there must, therefore, be a new trial.\nIt is admitted that the accident would not have happened if the contractor had excavated, as he was bound by his contract, down to rock excavation; but assuming that if the centre wall had been built upon the rock foundation, the floor upon which the sand was piled would have been sufficient to bear the weight of the sand, it may, nevertheless, be that although the centre wall was not carried down to rock foundation, still the accident might not have happened but for the great weight of the sand become saturated by the rain, and this act of placing the sand upon the floor comes clearly, as it appears to me, upon the authority of all the cases within the description of a collateral act for the consequences resulting from which the contractor, and not the defendant, would plainly be responsible. In fine, I can see no principle upon which this case can be taken out of that class of eases which is governed by the principle involved in the relation of master and servant, unless a jury should first find as a fact, upon the authority of Bower v. Peate and Angus v. Dalton, that the accident was in the natural cause of things to be apprehended as likely to occur from the erection of defendant's building, that the risk was obvious as necessarily attendant upon the erection of the building; but I cannot well see how upon the evidence a jury could come to such a conclusion, nor, if they should, how it could be upheld by the courts without practically reversing nearly all the cases which have been decided upon the principle involved in the relation of master and servant and nullifying that principle.\nTo hold that the plaintiff can recover from the defendant damages occasioned to the former by reason of his contractor not having completed his contract with plaintiff within the time limited in their contract or within a reasonable time; or moneys paid by the plaintiff to his contractor for rebuilding a wall damaged by the tort of that contractor, upon the ground that such tort was occasioned by the act of the contractor in the course of his executing work for the defendant upon an adjoining lot, by which act the defendant was damnified equally with the plaintiff; that in fact the plaintiff can recover from the defendant money paid by the plaintiff to his own contractor for work which the latter, as well by reason of his own tort, as by his covenant with the plaintiff to complete his building for him, was bound to execute without payment, would, as it seems to me, be a decision novel in its character, wholly without precedent, and which with great deference for the opinions of those with whom it is my misfortune to differ in this case, appears to me to be irreconcilable with any principle of law. In the argument before us it was contended that the building as designed by the defendant's contract departed in some particulars from certain regulations prescribed by a by-law of the corporation of the city of St. John, (in which city the building was being erected) passed after the contractors entered into their contract, but before the building was commenced, and that for this reason and for the reason that by an act of the provincial legislature, 41st Vict., ch. 6, sec. 6, it was enacted that all buildings hereafter erected in the city should be constructed in accordance with any law for the time being in force in the city regulating the construction of buildings, and by sec. 9, that any building which should be erected after the passing of the Act contrary to any of the provisions of the Act, should be and was thereby declared to be a public and common nuisance; and by section 10, that in addition to any indictment which might be found or any action which might be brought for such nuisance, the person erecting or causing to be erected, or who might attempt to erect or cause to be erected such building, should be liable to a penalty not exceeding $20, and to a further penalty of not less than $10 for each and every day on and during which such nuisance might be maintained and continued, to be recovered before the police magistrate of the city upon the information or complaint of the inspector of buildings or of any ratepayer, and to be paid to the Chamberlain of the city to the credit of the city, and it was contended, therefore, that this present action lay at the suit of the plaintiff againt the defendant.\nIt is unnecessary to determine a question raised in connection with this point, viz., whether it was competent for the provincial legislature so to extend the area of the criminal law, for even if the point were raised by the pleadings, which it does not seem to be, it could not give to the plaintiff any right to recover in this action, if independently of this point he had no right; for it is admitted that the particulars in which the defendant's building departed from the regulations prescribed by the by-law did not cause, and had no connection with the occurrence of, the accident which caused injury to the plaintiff, and it is obvious that the defendant's disobedience of the city regulations, in a matter having no connection with the occurrence of the thing which caused injury to the plaintiff, cannot entitle the plaintiff to recover damages from the defendant for an injury asserted by the plaintiff himself to be attributable to a totally different cause The question of the defendant's liability in this action must be determined by his responsibility or non-responsility by reason of some duty which he owed to the plantiff in connection with the thing which caused the plaintiff injury, and not by his responsibility or non-responsility to other persons for a thing which had no connection with the causing the injury sustained by the plaintiff.\nThe act or by-law, or both combined, cannot make the servants of the contractor to be servants of the defendants, so as to make the latter responsible for the acts of the servants of the contractor upon the principle of respondeat superior, neither do they create any new duty from the defendant to the plaintiff, which, irrespective of the act and by-law would not arise at common law from the nature and character of the act done which caused the injury, so that the question of defendant's liability to the plaintiff as for a breach of duty owed by the former to the latter must be determined irrespective of any consideration whether or not the defendant had complied with the provisions of the statute or the by-law. Indeed, it seems to me to be contrary to reason and common sense to hold the defendant liable to the plaintiff by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the by-law for an injury which the jury has found, and is upon all sides admitted, to be attributable, not to noncompliance with the provisions of the by-law, but to a cause wholly independent of, and in no way connected with, these provisions. But as the case at the trial did not proceed upon any such point, nor is any such point raised by the pleadings, and as the verdict moved against must be regarded as given under the influence of a direction of the learned judge to the jury, which direction was not warranted by law, the only mode of redressing the wrong arising from this misdirection in the charge of the learned judge who tried the cause, is by granting a new trial, so that the liability of the defendant, if he be at all liable, may be presented to the jury upon some acknowledged principle of law applicable to the case. I am, however, of opinion that the present action cannot be maintained, and that the plaintiff's sole remedy is against his contractor, who alone is responsible to the plaintiff for the damage he has sustained.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA;\nPetition of right\u2014Counsel fees, Action for\u2014Retainer for services before Fishery Commission\u2014Jurisdiction.\nThe suppliant, an advocate of the Province of Quebec, and one of Her Majesty's counsel, was retained by the Government of Canada as one of the counsel for Great Britain before the Fishery Commission which sat at Halifax pursuant to the Treaty of Washington, There was contradictory evidence as to the terms of the retainer, but the learned judge in the Exchequer Court found \"That each of the counsel engaged was to receive a refresher equal to the retaining fee of $1,000, that they were to be at liberty to draw on a bank at Halifax for $1,000 a month during the sittings of the commission, that the expenses of the suppliant and his family were to be paid, and that the final amount of fees was to remain unsettled until after the award.\" The amount awarded by the Commissioners was $5,500,000. The suppliant claimed $10,000 as his remuneration, in addition to $8,000 already received by him.\nHeld 1. Per Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J. J.: that the suppliant, under the agreement entered into with the Crown, was entitled to sue by petition of right for a reasonable sum in addition to the amount paid him, and that $8,000 awarded him in the Exchequer Court was a reasonable sum.\n2. Per Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J: By the law of the Province of Quebec, counsel and advocates can recover for fees stipulated for by an express agreement. 3. Per Fournier and Henry, J. J.: By the law also of the Province of Ontario, counsel can recover for such fees.\n4. Per Strong, J.: The terms of the agreement, as established by the evidence, shewed (in addition to an express agreement to pay the suppliant's expenses) only an honorary and gratuitous undertaking on the part of the Crown to give additional renumeration for fees beyond the amount of fees paid, which undertaking is not only no foundation for an action but excludes any right of action as upon an implied contract to pay the reasonable value of the services rendered; and the suppliant could therefore recover only his expenses in addition to the amount so paid.\n5. Per Ritchie, C. J.: As the agreement between the suppliant and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, on behalf of Her Majesty, was made at Ottawa, in Ontario, for services to be performed at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, it was not subject to the law of Quebec: that in neither Ontario nor Nova Scotia could a barrister maintain an action for fees, and therefore that the petition would not lie.\n6. Per Gwynne, J.: By the Petition of Right Act, sec. 8, the subject is denied any remedy against the Crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England, under similar circumstances. By the laws in force there prior to 23 and 24 Vic. cap. 34 (Imp.) counsel could not, at that time, in England, have enforced payment of counsel fees by the Crown, and therefore the suppliant should not recover.\nAppeal from of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe respondent filed a petition of right claiming from Her Majesty a sum of $10,000 as being the balance of the value of his work and labor, care, diligence and attendance in and about the preparation of and conducting Her Majesty's claim before the Halifax Commission, which sat under the Treaty of Washington, in the summer of 1877, at Halifax, to arbitrate upon the differences between Great Britain and the United States in connection with the value of the inshore fisheries, etc, and for money by respondent paid, laid out and expended in travelling and remaining at divers places on Her Majesty's business connected with the said claim. The respondent had been paid the sum of $8,000, and the Crown defended on the ground that the amount paid was accepted in full by the suppliant.\nThat if not accepted in full by the suppliant, the amount paid was a sufficient remuneration for his services, and that a petition of right did not lie to enforce a claim for counsel fees under the circumstances of this case.\nThe other facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgments. The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Fournier, Mr. Lash, Q.C., and Mr. Hogg appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr. Haliburton, Q.C., and Mr. Ferguson for the suppliant.\nOn the 13th January, 1881, Mr. Justice Fournier delivered the following judgment in favor of the suppliant:\n\"On the 1st day of October, 1875, the suppliant, an advocate and a Queen's counsel, residing in the city of Montreal, was retained by the then Minister of Justice, to act as counsel for the Government of Canada before the Fishery Commission, charged by the treaty of Washington between Her Majesty and the United States of America (8th May, 1871,) with the duty of deciding the amount to be paid by the Government of the United States for the privilege given to their citizens of using the fisheries of British North America in accordance with the XVIII Art of the treaty. The letter retaining the services of the suppliant as counsel in the matter is as follows:\u2014\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CANADA,\nOTTAWA, 1st October, 1875.\nSir,\u2014The Minister of Justice desires me to state that the Government being desirous to retain counsel to act for them upon the proceedings in connection with the Fishery Commission to sit at Halifax under the Treaty of Washington, he will be glad to avail himself of your services as one of such counsel in conjunction with Messrs. Samuel R. Thomson, Q.C., of St John, N.B., and Robert L. Weatherbe, Barrister, of Halifax. The Minister will be glad to know whether you are willing to act in that capacity, and in that case to place you in communication with the Department of Marine and Fisheries upon the subject.\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) H. BERNARD,\nD. M. J.\nJos. Doutre, Esq., Q.C.\nMontreal.\n\"The suppliant alleges that from that time (1st October 1875) he held himself at the disposal of the officers of the Crown, and was thereafter in correspondence with the Department of Marine and Fisheries, to whom the management of the Fishery Commission and the carrying out of the fishery clauses of the said treaty had been delegated. That he received most voluminous communications at different times, with request to make himself familiar with the contents thereof, and that in order to fulfil his duties he was obliged to freqnently travel from Montreal to Ottawa, &c. That when the commission was organized, he was requested to repair to Halifax to attend the sittings of the commission, commencing on the 15th June, 1877, and lasting until 23rd November following.\n\"That the sittings of the commission having been considered to last about six months he removed to Halifax with his family, and was there during the whole of that period attending day by day to the duties of his office.\n\"That by the award rendered by the commissioners the 23rd November, 1877, an indemnity of $5,500,000 was granted to Her Majesty's Government in return for the privileges accorded to the citizens of the United States under article XVIII of the said Treaty. That for more than two years he was employed in preparing and supporting the claim of Her Majesty. \"That the expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties exceeded eight thousand dollars and that he had not received anything as remuneration for his services.\n\"That considering the magnitude of the case, involving a claim of over fourteen millions of dollars, and resulting in an award of five millions and one half, and considering also the importance of the questions in dispute, which engaged the policy of the empire on most delicate subjects of international law, the moral responsibility of the petitioner, his prolonged studies and anxiety of mind were taxed to the extent of bringing heavy and lasting loss in his professional affairs, and to disarrange and entirely alter his family and domestic arrangements, the whole at heavy consequential expense and cost.\n\"That on the eve of leaving his home for Halifax, to wit: in May (1877), the petitioner made with the Department of Marine and Fisheries a temporary and provisional arrangement under which the petitioner should be paid one thousand dollars a month for current expenses while in Halifax, leaving the final settlement of fees and expenses to be arranged after the closing of the commission.\n\"That soon after the closing of the commission the suppliant, with the view of facilitating an immediate and amicable adjustment, limited his claims to $8,000, over and above the amount previously paid to him.\n\"That he was entitled to a much larger sum, and that in consequence of the expenses and loss of time incurred in travelling, corresponding, and otherwise endeavoring to obtain a settlement of his claim, with interest upon the amount thereof, he was entitled now to demand and receive $10,000 over and above the amount provisionally paid to him. Then follows two other allegations, one claiming the same amount as a quantum meruit for his services, and the other that Her Majesty's representatives had recognized his rights to the indemnity claimed.\n\"The answer of the Attorney General admits that the suppliant acted as one of the counsel for the Crown, but denies all other statements, and concludes as follows:\n\"'I submit that the suppliant as such counsel cannot enforce a claim for counsel fees, and that no action lies for the recovery thereof, and I claim the same benefit from said objection as if I had demurred to the said petition.'\n\"The suppliant then joined issue on all the paragraphs of the defendant's statement of defence, and as to paragraph 6 he specially replied that he is an advocate of the province of Quebec and as such fulfils the duties of solicitor, barrister, &c., and that it was as such advocate that he was retained by the Crown by the letter from the Department of Justice dated the 1st October, received by him at Montreal, from whence he wrote his reply agreeing to act for the Crown as requested, and that, as such advocate of the province of Quebec, he is by law of that province entitled to claim and recover from the Crown the amount claimed by him.\n\"On this issue a portion of the evidence relating to the value of the suppliant's services was taken at Montreal, and the balance was taken before me in open court, as well as the evidence, much more important, relating to the agreement as alleged by the suppliant in reference to his remuneration as counsel.\n\"Although the parties have argued several questions of importance there is really only one point upon the determination of which the decision of this petition rests: it is to determine whether a contract was in fact made between the parties, as alleged in the 9th paragraph of the petition, and whether, under that contract, the suppliant is entitled to recover by petition of right, the value of the services he rendered as an advocate and a counsel engaged by the Crown to act for it before the Commission at Halifax on the fishery question? I will not now refer to the question raised as to the place where the contract was entered into, as it is of importance only as regards the admissibility of the suppliant's evidence on his own behalf I will express my opinion on this point at a later stage, when I will refer to the evidence relating to the contract, its conditions and other circumstances which affect its character.\n\"The fact that there was a contract to pay a certain sum of money disposes of the objection made to the jurisdiction of this court by the counsel for the Crown for the first time on the argument. The Exchequer Court in England, having jurisdiction in all cases of demand by a subject against the Crown for money due or land claimed, the Exchequer Court of Canada having jurisdiction in similar cases, I need not add anything on this point, which does not seem to me to offer any difficulty.\n\"The evidence given in support of the alleged contract is both written and oral. The first consists of letters filed by the suppliant and the written memorandum of Mr. Whitcher, Commissioner of Fisheries, taken at the time of the interview which took place between the Minister of Marine and Fisheries and the suppliant, and at which interview the amount of remuneration to be paid to the counsel engaged before the commission at Halifax was settled upon; and the second consists of the oral testimonies of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, Sir Albert Smith, that of his deputy, Mr. Whitcher, and that of the suppliant. An unfortunate circumstance has deprived the suppliant of the possibility of producing the original of a letter addressed by him to the Minister, Sir Albert Smith, in which letter he explicitly stated the amount of remuneration that was to be paid to him and his colleagues. Although every effort has been made in the department to find this letter, the receipt of which is acknowledged, it has not been found. A press copy of the letter was sent by the suppliant to his colleagues at Halifax, and handed over from one to the other in order to let them know what was their position as to fees, and this copy also could not be found. Under such circumstances the suppliant is entitled to offer secondary evidence of the contents of the letter containing the agreement arrived at between himself and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. This evidence was received, and consists of the statements made by the petitioner, and of his letters on this subject to his colleagues\u2014and the evidence of the Commissioner of Fisheries, Mr. Whitcher. Mr. Doutre, referring to the lost letter, says in his evidence:\nI had a press copy of it, and in order to show my colleagues the ground on which we stood in Halifax it passed from one to another, and as I thought that I had fulfilled all the objects for which we had to go to Halifax, I never kept it. In that letter I stated to the Minister that the period of time during which I was going to be absent being so long, I did not think I could go there without taking my family with me, that the distance was so great that I could not expect to come home during the six months that the commission was expected to sit, that I could not leave my base of supplies without feeling that I would not be embarrassed for want of money in Halifax. I went further, and suggested that we should each receive a refresher of one thousand dollars, and that we should, while in Halifax, be able to draw on the bank at Halifax for $1,000 per month to meet our expenses. On this I received a telegram from the Minister to come to Ottawa. I came and had a conversation with him and Mr. Whitcher, The three of us were alone, and this was the only interview that I had on the subject. I insist upon this, because afterwards Sir A. J. Smith pretended that Sir A. T. Galt and Mr. Ford, the British Agent, and Mr. Bergne, Secretary of the Commission, at Halifax, knew something of the arrangement made with me. That could not possibly be, because that was the only occasion on which I had a conversation with the Minister on the subject, and the only person present then was Mr. Whitcher. The Minister had my letter in his hand, and he said: \"I would like to know what you mean by future arrangement as contained in your letter.\" I had stated that we would settle finally the amount of remuneration and expenses after the commission would be over. I said: \"I mean that I am too ignorant of the adventure into which I am entering to state precisely what the remuneration should be. I do not know how we will come out of that commission. I have no power to bind my colleagues, and I am making such arrangement as will suit them temporarily until the commission is over, and then it can be settled finally.\" I stated that for those two reasons\u2014that I could not bind my colleagues, and that I was too much in the dark to determine anything precisely\u2014I insisted upon making some temporary arrangement, which would relieve us from money embarrassment while we were away.\"\nThen Sir A. J. Smith said: \"Do you mean that if we obtain nothing from the Commission you will be lenient or have mercy upon us, and if we obtain a good award you will expect to be treated liberally?\" I said: You may put it on that basis if you like, but it \"is only then that we will be able to settle the matter.\" This ended the conversation. The $1,000 were expected to meet our expenses, and we were going to live in a place where we did not know how the expenses might run.\nQ. You proposed then that you should receive $1,000 refresher and $1,000 a month while in Halifax?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And subsequently to settle for your expenses and fees?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. About what time was the date of that interview?\u2014A. That interview must have taken place about the 23rd or 24th of May, because on the 25th I wrote to my several colleagues, telling them what had been done, and in each of these letters they stated to me\u2014it was particularly mentioned\u2014that the arrangement was purely a temporary one\u2014\u2014\nObjected to as secondary. Evidence allowed under reserve of objection.\nA. (Continued.) The letter which I now produce and fyle as Exhibit No. 4 was written to Mr. Thomson on the very day that I wrote that letter which is missing. There are two letters, dated the 7th May, one to Mr. Thomson and the other to Mr. Weatherbe. The one to Mr. Thomson was written on the 7th May, and on Saturday I wrote to Mr. Weatherbe to the same effect. Here is a letter written on the 30th of May to Mr. Davies living at Charlottetown, who was, at the time, Attorney General in his province.\nThis was after that interview, so that the letters written immediately after my letter to the Minister agree together, and all show the agreement between the Minister and myself.\n\"According to Sir Albert Smith's statement of what took place at that interview, the nature of the agreement arrived at would be totally different from what is alleged by the suppliant. Instead of being, as alleged by Mr. Doutre, a provisional understanding that the amount of fees to be paid him would be only definitely settled upon when the final award of the commissioners was given, the arrangement, as remembered by Sir Albert Smith, was a final arrangement, and was such as stated by Mr. Doutre, except as to the latter part, which leaves the question of the amount unsettled.\nThey are both in direct contradiction on this important point. I will therefore also read the evidence given by Sir A. Smith. He says:\nMy memory of the conversation is this: they had already received $1,000 which I understood to be a compensation for services up to that time. After that we were to give them $1,000 a month while in Halifax, and Mr. Doutre suggested that in case we succeeded in obtaining a handsome award, it would be a matter for the Government to consider if they were to get a gratuity after the case was over; that was my understanding.\nQ. Then $2,000 would be the amount in full up to that time?\u2014 A. Yes, that was my understanding; Mr. Doutre said, I recollect distinctly, something about gratuity if we succeeded in getting a handsome award. That then it would be a matter for the Government to consider whether they would make gratuity.\nQ. But the contract for payment was limited to $1,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And anything further than that was to be a gratuity?\u2014A. That was my understanding of it, and that is what I communicated to my colleagues and to Mr. Ford. I know that Mr. Ford and I discussed the question. Mr. Doutre knows that too. I told him more than once that I would have to communicate the matter to Mr. Ford.\nQ. That a $1,000 a month while in Halifax was to cover the services and expenses?\u2014A. I understood it so. I remember that Mr. Doutre stated on this occasion that he intended to take his family to Halifax, but that was a matter I did not think the Government would be justified in paying his expenses. That was personal to himself.\nQ. You certainly did not agree to pay the expenses of his family?\u2014 A. As a member of the Government I could not assume any such liability as that.\n\"I find here two contradictory statements. The suppliant swears the amount of fees was to be settled upon after the final determination of the proceedings of the commission, whilst Sir Albert Smith states that the payment of $1,000 per month so long as the sittings of the commission would last was all that he agreed to pay. The suppliant also adds that his expenses as well as those of his family were to be paid above the amount to be paid him for his fees. Sir Albert Smith does not contradict this statement, but says that as a member of the Government he could not have assumed that responsibility.\n\"The witnesses who have made such contradictory statements are both men of honor and of equal respectability\u2014neither one nor the other can be suspected of wishing to mislead the court. It can only be a question of memory, so that if no corroborative evidence was given I would have, independently of the fact that the suppliant's evidence is that of an interested witness, come to the conclusion that he had not proved the contract on which he has based his claim. But it appears that there was a third party present at the interview in question, whose testimony must be taken into consideration, and it induces me to adopt one version in preference to that of the other. It was Mr. Whitcher who was then present in his official capacity, and who, as Commissioner of Fisheries, attended under the direction of the Minister to almost all matters connected with the Fisheries Commission at Halifax. There was no matter of importance concluded without his knowledge, and his evidence in his position must therefore have great weight in deciding what agreement was arrived at.\nMr. Whitcher's evidence:\nQ. You have heard the letter written by Mr. Doutre, May, 1877, with regard to the remuneration of counsel?\u2014A, Yes.\nQ. Had you that letter in your possession?\u2014A. There were several discussions with regard to the remuneration of counsel. On one occasion I remember the Minister asked Mr. Doutre to put the demand of the several counsel in writing. This letter, I suppose, would be the result of that. I saw it in the hands of the Minister and it formed the subject of a discussion with the Minister. The last place that I saw that letter was in the hands of Mr. Ford, with whom the Minister was consulting with regard to the rates to be allowed. I searched the records to make sure that it had not escaped attention. I locked not only in the records but also among the semi-official letters which are not on record in the department, but could not find it.\nQ. Subsequent to the receipt of the letter Mr, Doutre had an interview with the Minister in reference to this question, had he not? \u2014A. Yes, Mr. Doutre was there quite a number of times, but I remember one particular instance when he pressed for a decision as well for the other counsel as on his own behalf. That was the occasion, if I recollect rightly, when this letter was discussed, but there had been other discussions at intervals prior to that.\nQ. What took place at that interview?\u2014A. It would be difficult to say what occurred, there was so much conversation.\nQ. Who was present?\u2014 A. I was present, but took no part in the conversation.\nQ. Who else was present?\u2014A. The Minister and Mr. Doutre.\nQ. This latter, you say, was discussed, was any definite arrangement arrived at?\u2014A. The general character of the conversation was that the Minister seemed a little unwilling to have the thing open, and was pressing for some definite terms, as I understood it. It ended in an understanding that this would be a temporary arrangement so far as it was not specified, that is to say, there was to be $1,000 paid for retainer, $1,000 for refresher, and $1,000 per month while the commission sat. There was some difference as to the junior counsel, but that is not pertinent to this. Further remuneration to these amounts was to form the subject of after consideration. I do not pretend to recite the words, there were so many conversations that it would be impossible to remember them all.\nQ. Did you make a note of the conversation?\u2014A. Yes. As I was paymaster throughout the whole commission I kept memoranda of all agreements.\nQ. Have you & memorandum of that agreement?\u2014A. I have memoranda of all discussions which took place, but of course these are to a certain extent official records, and I have no authority for laying these before the court. They contain other matter not at all pertinent to the case.\nQ. Have you the memorandum here?\u2014A. I have, there is an entry on the 10th May, 1877. I may statethat there were discussions constantly going on as to the counsel, Professor Hind, Mr. Miall and others engaged upon the commission. This entry is amongst others, and is as follows:\u2014\"Counsel want $1,000 each as refresher and all expenses paid at Halifax.\" This, if I recollect it rightly in my memory, was the occasion when the Minister asked Mr. Doutre to reduce the proposition to writing. Further on I find amongst a number of other entries dated 23rd of May, the following:\u2014\"Agreed with counsel another $1,000 refresher and $1,000 per month during session of commission, all expenses of travelling and subsistence and a liberal gratuity on the conclusion of business.\"\nI do not say that these are the exact words, but they are the substance of what I was to consider my directions.\nQ. You have repeated one expression that you said you thought was used in the interview between Mr. Doutre and the Minister, that is \"gratuity\"?\u2014A. I took the liberty of saying that those were not the words used, but the substance of them.\nQ. What did you understand by the use of that word?\u2014A. In connection with it being a temporary arrangement, it would be the final remuneration, you use the word \"gratuity\" when the money is not definite. If I go out on special service I would receive so much, and if, according to the issue of it I would get so much more, I would consider it a gratuity because it is not specified.\n\"This evidence, corroborated by the memorandum taken at the time of what took place during the interview between the Minister of Marine and Fisheries and the suppliant, confirms on every point the statement made by Mr. Doutre, and if we add to this the evidence to be gathered from the letters written by the suppliant to his colleagues, there is no doubt what conclusions ought to be arrived at.\n\"It must also be remarked that Sir Albert Smith admits that the only person he spoke to about the fees counsel were to receive was Mr. Doutre, and that he made no agreement whatever with the other counsel, Mr. Doutre acting officiously as senior counsel for his colleague. He had no authority to bind them, a fact which he states positively, and which Mr. Thomson one of the counsel corroborates. Then what was his first duty after he had concluded this agreement with the Minister? To communicate these conditions to his colleagues, and I find he did so as may be seen by the following letters:\n\"Letter to Mr. Thomson:\nI have just written to Honorable A. J. Smith a confidential letter, in which I tell him that yourself and Mr. Weatherbe had left in my hands the question of our remuneration as counsel, but that I did not feel like taking the responsibility of committing us to any definite thing deprived as I was of your advice; that, however, I owed it to you and myself to take the necessary measures to provide for the present and the approaching session of the commissioners, that I thought we were entitled, as a mere temporary arrangement, to a refresher of $1,000 each, and that provisions should be made in your bank in Halifax where we could each draw one thousand dollars a month, beginning on the first of June. Adding that our sojourn in Halifax would necessarily be expensive, and that cut as we would be from our base of supply, we should feel at ease in this respect. This leaves the thing intact for further arrangements.\n\"Letter to Mr. Davies:\nI have been in Ottawa at different intervals, and at a time I met there Mr. Thomson and Mr. Weatherbe. We understood you were prevented from coming by your parliamentary duties; we had spoken together of the advisability of coming to some understanding in regard to our fees with the Government, but Mr. Thomson and Mr, Weatherbe left without coming to anything in this respect. After their departure I went again to Ottawa with Messrs. Galt, Ford and Bergne, and I submitted the following proposition, viz: That each of us should receive a refresher equal to the original retainer, and that we should be allowed to draw on some bank in Halifax a similar amount to such retainer every month while being there, leaving a final arrangement to be made after the award, giving me to understand that if we were not very successful we would ask little or nothing.\nThis last part, however, is verbal only; what is written is that the above proposition would be a temporary arrangement, as I had no time to bind my colleagues. This was agreed upon. You may therefore draw upon W. F. Whitcher, Esq., Commissioner of Fisheries, for an amount equal to your first retainer.\n\"In addition to these letters the suppliant wrote on the 25th May, 1877 to Sir A. J. Smith informing him that he communicated to Messrs Thomson and Weatherbe the substance of their agreement in respect to the remuneration of counsel, viz: \"I wrote to Messrs. Thomson and Weatherbe the substance of our arrangement as regards counsel.\"\n\"On the same day, in writing to Mr. Whitcher on various matters concerning this business, he says: \"I wrote to Messrs. Thomson and Weatherbe the substance of the arrangement concerning the counsel. I think you should write to Mr. Davies.\" It appears from the date of two of these letters that they were written immediately after the letter he sent to Sir Albert Smith, as regards counsel fees, and in both of which he repeats the agreement made with the Minister, and states that it was provisional.\n\"Here also we find that immediately after sending this letter to the Minister he writes on the 30th May, to the Hon. T. H. Davies, informing him that the proposal he made had been accepted, summing up the result of his proceedings, viz: \"I submitted the following proposition that, viz: each of us should receive a refresher equal to the original retainer, and that we be allowed to draw on some bank in Halifax a similar amount. Such retainer every month while there, leaving a final arrangement to be made after the award, giving me to understand that if we were not very successful we would ask little or nothing. This last part, however, is verbal only, what is written is that the above proposition would be a temporary arrangement, as I had no right to bind my colleagues. This was agreed upon. You may, therefore, draw immediately upon W. F. Whitcher, Esq., Commissioner of Fisheries, for an amount equal to your first retainer.\"\n\"It is clearly established by these letters, the two first being written on the 7th May, 1877, before the interview with the Minister, that Mr. Doutre referred to this arrangement as being a provisional arrangement. Now, relying upon the evidence of the suppliant, the evidence of Mr. Whitcher, and the notes he took down during Mr. Doutre's interview with the Minister, the letters addressed by suppliant to his colleagues, and taking into consideration the important fact that Sir Albert Smith has not in his possession any letters or notes referring to this matter to corroberate his statement, I have arrived at the conclusion that the proposal made to the Minister by Mr. Doutre by the letter which the Crown has been unable to produce, but the terms and conditions of which have been proved by the suppliant and other letters, was accepted by the Minister at the interview which took place between them on the 23rd May, and at which interview Mr. Whitcher was present taking notes, and that the terms of the agreement were as follows: That each of the counsel engaged would receive a refresher equal to the first retainer of $1,000, that they could draw on a bank at Halifax $1,000 per month while the sittings of the commission lasted, that the expenses of the suppliant and of his family would be paid, and that the final amount of fees or remuneration to be paid to counsel would remain unsettled until after the award of the commissioners.\n\"From the evidence adduced I find that these are the terms and conditions of the contract entered into between the suppliant and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries.\n\"It was at Ottawa the contract was concluded during the interview which Mr. Whitcher attended, to which Mr. Doutre had been specially called.\n\"Being of opinion that the contract was concluded at Ottawa and not at Montreal as contended for by the suppliant, the question which was raised as to the admissibility of the suppliants' evidence on his own behalf must, therefore, be decided in accordance with the law in force in Ontario.\n\"The law in Ontario allows a party to a suit to be heard on his own behalf, I, therefore, find that the evidence of the suppliant which would not be admissible in this case according to the laws of Quebec, forms part of the record and is legal evidence.\n\"I do not think there is any weight in the observation made by Sir Albert Smith that he had no right to assume the responsibility of paying the expenses of Mr. Doutre's family.\n\"Sir Albert Smith had, over this question of expenses, which was only one of the several points to be considered, when determining the amount of remuneration to be paid counsel, the same authority he had to agree to pay the amounts specified as refreshers and the other sums payable monthly, it being a matter of agreement. I am of opinion that the evidence shows the payment of these expenses was one of the stipulations of the contract. Moreover, his authority to enter into such an agreement has not been denied by any of the pleas set up by the defence, he alone has referred to it. Now, whether the suppliant could bring an action before a Court of Justice to recover the amount due him under an agreement for his services as advocate, counsel, &c., is a point which cannot admit of a doubt after the decisions which have been given by courts of justice in the province of Ontario and Quebec. See McDougall v. Campbell[1]. Beaudry v. Ouimet[2].\n\"Moreover, in this case the right of action is based on a contract made by the Government under the authority, first of the treaty of Washington, 8th May, 1871, and then of 85 Vic. c. 2, which incorporated as part of the law of Canada, the fishery articles of the treaty. It is under article 25 of the treaty which imposes upon each of the high contracting parties the obligation to pay the counsel retained by them to prepare and support their case before the commission, that this contract has been made.\n\"This obligation, independent of the decisions of the courts, gives to the counsel engaged a right of action to recover a remuneration for their services. This right of action, in the present case, as I have just stated, is founded on a statutory enactment, and as I am of opinion that the suppliant's right to recover is based on the law and the agreement entered into between the parties, I have not deemed it necessary to examine the point raised, whether on a simple case of quantum meruit, the suppliant could have recovered the value of his services in the present case, as they were rendered outside of the forum of courts of justice. I am of opinion that the facts of the case do not allow me to consider this question. But as I have shewn above, the contract has not determined a fixed amount of remuneration to be paid; on the contrary, it was agreed upon between the parties that the amount would be settled only after the award of the commissioners. Since that time the parties have been unable to arrive at a settlement, and it is therefore now the duty of the court to determine the amount from the evidence adduced in the case.\n\"In order to arrive at a proper and equitable conclusion on this point, it is necessary for me to take into consideration, not only the amount of professional work done before the commission which sat for six months, but also the enormous amount of work bestowed in preparing the case, the magnitude of the amount involved, estimated by the Canadian Government at $12,000,000, the importance of the questions in dispute, the responsibility of the counsel and the result of the award. In order to give an exact idea of this I cannot do better than cite a part of the evidence relating to this branch of the case.\n\"It will be seen that the suppliant did not act only as counsel to argue the case and give his opinion, but acted also as solicitor and advocate by preparing and conducting the procedure before the commission.\nImmediately after my letter of acceptance I received most voluminous correspondence from Ottawa, all marked \"Confidential,\" which I could not read or study at my office without running a risk of breaking the seal of confidence which was impressed upon every paper transmitted to me, so I had to work at home and at night giving opinions on all those papers, as I was requested to do. Almost every time that I received papers from the department I. was requested after reading them to give my opinion or impression on the subject. If it were not loading the case with too voluminous papers, I could show what I received gradually from the department, but it is an immense mass of paper and I do not know that it is of any use putting it in.\nI had many interviews with the Department of Marine and Fisheries, generally with the Minister himself, or the Commissioner of Fisheries, Mr. Whitcher. At times I spent three weeks in Ottawa in consultation, in order to see what kind of questions we would bring before the Commission, it was a most intricate matter, unknown to any member of any bar, and unknown also to the department in which it had originated, we were in complete darkness * * * I have referred now to the only two meetings, one in St John, N.B., and the other in Ottawa, that we had of the counsel together. In addition to that, I was very often called upon to come up from Montreal to Ottawa to consult with the department; I was also charged by Mr. Ford to prepare rales of procedure for the commission and I spent here some eight or ten days in selecting books in the Parliament Library to support the contention that we were interested in\u2014books on international law, some sixty or seventy volumes, which I requested to be sent to Halifax for the use of the commission\u2014I could not designate those books without knowing whether they would be suitable, and so to make that selection of sixty or seventy volumes I had to handle some two hundred volumes first.\nIn the interval between my appointment in the fall of 1875 up to the meeting of the commission I received many papers, some of which are fyled. I received them periodically and several times during the week at times, but at other times at greater intervals.\n\"We can imagine the amount of work performed by counsel by referring to Mr. Whitcher's answer to the following question:\nQ. During the two years prior to the meeting of the commission, or from October, 1875, when Mr. Doutre was retained, until the Commission sat, you say that Mr. Doutre made numerous visits to Ottawa in the preparation of the case?\nA. Yes, there was an immense mass of material to be dealt with and digested, and there was a very indefinite proceeding before us with regard to what portions of this could be used for legal effect, and what form the case should take and what evidence was necessary, and we communicated to the counsel all the materials accumulated there for use as it might be determined by the British and Canadian Government. All this was referred to them, and they were asked to examine it carefully and pronounce their opinions upon it, and from my own knowledge of the labor involved in getting it up I think they must have had a hard time of it going through it.\n\"If we remember that the matter in dispute relates back to the American War of Independence of 1775, and that it was discussed at length at the treaty of Paris 3rd Sept., 1783, then again at Ghent at the treaty of December 24th, 1814, but not included in that treaty, because the high contracting parties could not agree, and that it was only after overcoming many difficulties, after the seizure of vessels, and the exchange of lengthy correspondence between the interested parties, that the question was finally referred to International Commissioners, who passed the convention of 1818, by which both countries were guided until 1847, when the parliament of Canada initiated the proceedings which resulted in the treaty of reciprocity of the 5th June, 1854, between the United States of America and Canada, and remember that after and since the expiration of the treaty of the 17th March, 1866, this question remained unsettled up to the time of the Washington treaty, which adopted as the proper mode of settlement of this much vexed question the reference of the whole matter to the commission at Halifax; and if we consider the large field of study and the amount of researches necessary to grapple this case properly, I think it is impossible to over estimate its importance, and it will be easier to value the large amount of work done by counsel in preparing this case, which cannot be said to be of less importance than the Geneva arbitration under the some treaty, and in supporting the claim of Her Majesty before the commission at Halifax, and I do not think it can astonish us, if Mr. Doutre, in his evidence, says that he has been exclusively engaged working for the Government of Canada for 240 days. I will again give an extract of the evidence on this point.\nI was engaged in this matter during eight months, I consider constantly, that is to say sis months in Halifax, one month that I devoted to coming here to Ottawa, and putting together all the time that I spent at home on the papers and writting letters, I put at one month, and I think it is a very moderate estimate. This would make out that I was engaged in this matter 240 days. I put this down at $50.00 a day which is the remuneration which I generally charge to other clients, and my expenses at the rate of $20.00 a day, that is exclusive of travelling expenses going to and coming from Halifax, which I put at $275.00. The expenses in Montreal during my six months absence I put at $250.\nWhen I go to England and on my return make out the account of my expenses I find that they average $20.00 a day. I have been coming to Ottawa and returning to Montreal, but that is included in the 240 days. \"During a short adjournment of the commission Mr. Doutre was absent from Halifax for six or eight days, during that time he was engaged on other business for two days. I would be disposed to deduct them from the 240 days during which he says he was at work on matters relating to the Fishery Commission, but it appears to me that he credited that short absence when he computed the number of days he was employed at home as when he puts the time he devoted at home to this work he states it is a very moderate estimate. If I entertained any doubt that Mr. Doutre was getting paid twice for these few days I would order him to be interrogated de novo on this point, but believing he has given the exact number of days I will not do so, and I will adopt that number of days during which he says he was employed at the work for which he had been retained.\n\"Now is the sum of $50 per day which the suppliant claims, a reasonable amount? Mr. Doutre tells us that it is the price he gets ordinarily when he is obliged to absent himself from his office, exclusive of his expenses, which he always demands.\n\"His evidence on this point is corroborated by that of a number of distinguished members of the bar of Montreal, who being called as witnesses in this case prove that the sum of $50 per day, exclusive of expenses, is the ordinary amount charged by them in important cases which entail the absence of the lawyer from his office. Some extracts of the evidence on this point prove this conclusively\n\"W. H. Kerr, Q.C., after referring to two cases, in one of which his fees were $3,500 and the other $4,000, says:\nI have received on many occasions for trials, here, at the rate of one hundred dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars a day for attendance in court. In a recent case, in the case against Sir Francis Hincks and other directors of the Consolidated Bank, I received twelve hundred dollars. I think it lasted six days and one day in the Court of Queen's Bench on the reserved question.\n\"In the case of Hon. A. Angers, Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec, and The Queen Insurance Company, which, lasted one day and a-half, his fee as one of the three counsel employed was $500, the other two counsel, J. C. Abbott, Q.C., and Mr. Doutre, the suppliant, received a similar amount.\n\"In the case of the Hamilton Powder Company for insurance, the trial having lasted four and one-half days, his fee was $600, and that of Mr. Carter, Q.C., for the defence, $1,000. Among other cases, he cited the cases of Worms, Caldwell and Foster, extradition cases, in which the United States were interested, and his fee in each of these cases was $1,000. The time given to each of them was not more than 3 or 4 hours.\n\"Mr. Laflamme Q.C., received $4,000 fees in the case of the Bank of Toronto and The European Insurance Company. In the case of Simpson v. the Bank or Montreal, his fee was over $5,000. These cases did not oblige him to leave the city, and one of them did not take more than three or four months of his time. In the case of the St. Albans Raiders, his fee was $1,500. In the case of Fraser, which, without including the time he spent in preparing the argument, lasted about two months, his fees were $6,000.\n\"In the case of the explosion of the ferry boat at Longueuil he got $1,000 for one day he was engaged on the case.\n\"In the matter of the seignorial indemnity claimed by Mr. DeBeaujeu, in which Mr. Laflamme was occupied for a few months, but with the understanding that he could attend to his business at the office three days in the week, his fee was $5,000.\n\"Mr F. X. Archambault says that in his practice, which is both civil and criminal, the retainers or extra fees vary from $500 upwards and sometimes $1000, it depends on the importance of the case and its difficulties.\n\"In a case against one Henault, although there were three cap. ad resp. it was practically only one case, which took about one month of his time, he charged $2,800. In the case of Martin v. Gravel which was appealed to the Privy Council, he received $2,000. He cannot remember all the cases in which he received such large fees, but mentions these as examples. He states that in all important cases, either civil or criminal, a retainer of from $400 to $500 is generally charged. As to the sum of $50 per day, exclusively of expenses, claimed by Mr. Doutre, Mr. Archambault says: \"I think a charge would not be looked upon in Montreal (and in Quebec also, I suppose, although I have not practised there) as at all exaggerated fixed at the rate mentioned by Mr. Doutre in his evidence $50 00 a day and expenses. That is what I charge when I have to go to Quebec to look after charters. That is my usual charge. I charged up to $1,500 to obtain a charter during last session, and it did not take more than a fortnight of my time.\n\"Messrs. Duhamel and Walker with Mr. Archambault, state that $50 per day and expenses is a reasonable charge for the services rendered by the suppliant.\n\"Messrs. W. Robertson, Q.C., and W. Ritchie, Q.C. spoke of the fees received by the lawyers of the city of Montreal in the like manner as the other barristers who had been examined as witnesses.\n\"Mr. Thomson, Q.C., the eminent lawyer of the bar of St John, whose untimely death shall long be regretted, and who was one of Mr. Doutre's colleagues, in his evidence said that $100 per day would have been a reasonable enough remuneration. All lawyers agree in saying that under such circumstances it is not only necessary when estimating the value of the service of counsel to take into consideration the amount involved in the case, the difficulties and the novelty of the question to be treated, but also the length of time the counsel may be absent from his office, which absence always very seriously affects his business.\n\"This was certainly the case for the suppliant, and for Mr. Thomson\u2014by their absence, which lasted six months, they almost ruined their professional business. It is in evidence that the income of the suppliant, owing to his absence, was reduced from $16,000 to $4,000. Although the disastrous consequences of this absence cannot be taken into consideration in estimating the amount of his fees, and the suppliant must console himself for this loss with the thought that he has achieved together with his colleagues a remarkable success, yet the absence anticipated, which was considered would last six months, must be borne in mind as being one of the elements upon which the remuneration is to be determined. All the lawyers who have been examined as witnesses have drawn a considerable distinction between the fees charged for services rendered at the ordinary place of business of counsel, and those for services rendered which necessitate an absence, thereby leaving it impossible for them to direct and watch over the business of their office.\n\"Although this evidence seems to be irresistible, we can also, in order to ascertain whether the amount demanded is not exaggerated, compare it with the amounts paid by the unsuccessful party to this celebrated case.\n\"The Government of the United States paid its agent and counsel, Hon. Dwight Foster, for his services in the same case, $9,000, exclusive of all his expenses and those of his family. The other two counsel engaged with him and who commenced to take part in the proceedings before the commission only on the 15th of August, received each $5,000, exclusive of all their expenses and those of their family. It is clear from this that Mr. Doutre's demand is far from being excessive.\n\"For these various reasons I am of opinion that the sum of $50 per day as a remuneration and the sum of $20 per day for his expenses, including the expenses of his family, would be a reasonable amount as a remuneration for the services rendered, and that the agreement entered into between the parties was to that effect. In adopting these figures, it will be seen that the Crown is not made to pay more to the suppliant than what the suppliant and a great number of other lawyers would have charged to their ordinary clients in important cases, the importance of which would never equal the importance of the case which the suppliant conducted before the commission at Halifax. By taking these figures in computing the amount of the remuneration and adding thereto certain sums for travelling expenses, &c., mentioned in the suppliant's deposition, it will be found that the total amount exceeds $ 16,000. The Government have paid suppliant $8,000, which leaves a balance in favor of the suppliant of over $8,000, but as he has by letter, dated May 16th, 1878, reduced his demand to $8,000, I will adopt that sum as being the amount due.\n\"The suppliant by his petition claims, outside of the amount due him for his remuneration and expenses, a sum of $2,000 damages for the loss of time and expenses incurred while endeavoring to effect an amicable settlement with the Government which had retained him and with the present Government of the day.\n\"To obtain this settlement he made several trips to Ottawa, entertained a lengthy correspondence with divers Ministers and Members of Parliament in order to avoid the necessity of having recourse to a petition of right to obtain his due, which he thought would be a scandal, as it related to a matter of international rights of great importance.\n\"Whilst recognising the honorable motives which induced the suppliant to act in this manner, and admitting that he has, no \"doubt, been put to large expenses, I cannot entertain such a claim. It cannot be recognized as a legal claim. It is very true that the suppliant, hoping to obtain an amicable settlement, delayed the filing of his petition of right. This delay took place for the benefit of the Government, and in justice and equity, the Government ought to pay him interest. But, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the obligation to pay interest is a moral obligation and not a legal obligation which a court of justice could enforce. The suppliant, therefore, must rely on the spirit of equity and justice of the Government.\n\"On the whole, I am of opinion that the suppliant is entitled to receive from the Crown the sum of $8,000, as a remuneration for his services with interest on that amount since the 29th August, 1879, the date upon which the petition of right was received by the Secretary of State, the whole with costs.\"\nThe usual motion to revise the judgment was made, but it was refused.\nThe case was thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., and Mr. Hogg with him, for appellant:\nThe suppliant's services, for which he now sues the Crown, were rendered as one of the counsel in the British interests before the \"Halifax Commission,\" which sat under the Treaty of Washington. The services were to be rendered at Halifax, in Nova Scotia; therefore the law of the place of performance governs as to the right of the parties under the contract (if any) entered into between Her Majesty and the suppliant. Story, on Conflict of Laws[3], lays down the law as follows on this point:\n\"Where the contract is either expressly or tacitly to be performed in any other place (than where it is made) there the general rale is in conformity to the presumed intention of the parties that the contract as to its validity (except as to form), nature, obligations and interpretation, is to be governed by the law of the place of performance.\"\nThis statement of the law is adopted by Dicey, on Domicile[4]; same doctrine in Von-Savigny's Private International Law[5]; see also Beard v. Steele[6]; Lloyd v. Guilbert[7].\nNow whether the contract should be governed by the law of Ontario, where it was made, or by the law of Nova Scotia, where the services were performed, the suppliant cannot recover for his fees. The case of Baldwin v. Mongomery[8] has decided that the English rule on this subject is in force in Ontario.\nIn England, Kennedy v. Broun[9] decides that:\n\"The relation of counsel and client renders the parties mutually incapable of making any contract of hiring and service concerning advocacy in litigation.\" The case, therefore, decides that there is an absolute incapacity to contract. A physician's case is different; there, there is no incapacity, and an express contract is binding. According to usage, no action lies for their fees, and unless there be an express contract, they are presumed to be governed by the usage.\nNow the services rendered by the suppliant in this case were \"advocacy in litigation,\" within the meaning of that term as used in Kennedy v. Broun. The proceedings in Halifax were proceedings such as are usual in a court. The suppliant himself in his evidence admits it, for he says:\u2014\"It was a court like this court; there was only one witness examined at a time, so only one lawyer was employed at a time, &c;\" and, again, he says: \"The proceedings were the same as in a court of law.\"\nThe language used in Kennedy v. Broun[10] covers exactly suppliant's position.\nBut it is contended that, in addition to services as an advocate, the suppliant performed other services, such as coming to Ottawa, preparing case, &c., for which he can recover. There are two answers to this. First, the sum paid him is sufficient to cover all such expenses; and, secondly, these services were merely auxiliary to the service as an advocate, and if the principal service could not be the subject of a contract, neither could any service which was merely accessory thereto, and of no value without the principal. I do not contend that a counsel should act for nothing, or that he should be satisfied with what his client may seem fit to give, for the moment I am dealing with the naked legal question as to his right to recover by action for his fee, and on this point the law is clear, and the rule laid down in Kennedy v. Broun has been extended in 1870 to non-litigious business by Moystyn v. Moystyn[11], so that even if this court were of opinion that the services rendered were not advocacy in litigation, the suppliant cannot recover. See also Veitch v. Russell[12], and Hope v. Caldwell[13]. As to McDougall v. Campbell[14], relied on by the judge of the court below, it was held that the plaintiff there could enforce a claim for counsel fees upon an express promise to pay an amount fixed by a third person. The claim here is on a quantum meruit, and in that respect McDougall v. Campbell does not apply. Moreover, I submit, that the decision of the majority of that court, which is not binding on this court, is erroneous and contrary to the law of England, in force in Ontario, on this subject.\nThe learned counsel then referred to the contract as gathered from the evidence, and contended that by the terms of the contract, the suppliant could not recover, as he expressly agreed to accept a gratuity, leaving it entirely in the hands of the Government what it should be; and also contended, upon the evidence, that, even admitting the suppliant's view of the contract, it was proved beyond all doubt that suppliant had been paid at the rate of $30 per day and his expenses for the actual time he had been employed as counsel, and that the amount paid was a sufficient remuneration.\nI will now take up suppliant's contention that because he is an advocate of the bar of Quebec, the law of Quebec governs, and that by that law he is entitled to recover upon this petition.\nTo this we submit, 1st. That by sec. 19 of the Petition of Right Act, the law of England must be looked to, and that if in England no action lies against the Crown for counsel fees, in Canada, no such action can be taken against the Crown by petition of right. 2nd That if the law of Quebec governs, suppliant's evidence is inadmissible.\nThe principal cases in Quebec on the subject are. Devlin v. Tumblety[15], Grimard v. Burroughs[16]. The head note to this case is: \"A barrister or attorney cannot recover, on a quantum meruit and verbal evidence of value of services, the amount of a fee claimed by him over and above the amount of his taxed costs from his client.\" Amyot v. Gugy[17], Larue v. Loranger, appeal side Q. B. reported in legal news of 4th Sept., 1880.\nMy last point is: the Crown is not liable to pay interest on the suppliant's claim. The statutes relating to interest do not apply to the Crown. Re Gosman[18]\nMr. Laflamme, Q. C., for respondent:\nThe rights, privileges, liabilities and remedies of the members of legal profession in England are very different from those of the members of the same profession in Canada.\nIn Ontario the professions of barrister and attorney may be united in one person, and so in Quebec and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whilst in England they cannot. In Ontario a barrister, who is also an attorney, and even if not an attorney, may deal directly with the client, and recover his counsel fees and other costs by action from his client. This principle is sanctioned by legislation in Ontario, in giving powers to courts to make tariffs, &c., providing for counsel fees, &c., also by decisions of the courts.\nSee McDougall v. Campbell[19] and other decisions and statutes there referred to.\nThis right of action of a barrister to recover counsel fees by suit, whether according to a tariff (if there is one) if the proceedings in respect of which the services were rendered were in a suit, or in other cases to recover upon a quantum meruit, has long been recognized in Quebec.\nThe cases of Larue v. Loranger[20] and Devlin v. Tumblety[21], cited by the counsel for the Crown in this case, do not negative this right of action. The point which they decide, and notably the latest case, Larue v. Loranger (in appeal), being, as will be seen on close examination, that where there is a tariff recognized fixing the fees for certain classes of work, an action upon a quantum meruit will not lie, but the counsel must either be satisfied with what the tariff allows, or be in a position to prove a distinct agreement with the client for a sum certain in excess of the tariff allowance.\nWhere, however, there is no tariff applicable and no special agreement made, an action on the quantum meruit will still lie in Quebec, and such is this case, and such was also the law of Quebec prior to 23 and 24 Vic. See Amyot v. Gugy[22].\nIn France I find also that, where there is no tariff, the counsel alone is the judge of the value of his services, and if he charges too high, the client can appeal to the council of law. See Morin, Discipline des cours[23]. Duchesne and Picard, Manuel de la Profession d'Avocat[24]. Journal de Palais[25].\nOur civil code also recognizes the right of a barrister to sue for services rendered by Art. 2260, that applies to all kinds of professional services.\nIt has been contended that because the services were performed at Halifax, the principles of our law should not govern this case. Now by the pleadings, and it is also proved by the evidence in the case, the contract was made in Montreal, the respondent undertook, as a counsel of the bar of the province of Quebec, to represent Her Majesty wherever the Commission sat. If it had sat in New York, it would not have been the law of New York that would have governed. It was an accident that Halifax was chosen as the seat of the Commission. When Mr. Doutre was arguing the case, he was not acting as a Nova Scotia barrister, in fact he would have no locus standi as such. When a counsel is acting before an arbitration, or say the Supreme Court, or even the Privy Council, he is entitled to all the rights and privileges of the profession to which he belongs.\nNow with respect to the contract, I submit it is first of all established by the treaty, for in it we find a provision that counsel were to be employed, and surely when one party requests the services of another, and the latter agrees to give them, there is a complete contract. What were the conditions of the contract in this case? On this point I rely upon the finding of the Judge who tried the case, and contend that the evidence clearly establishes that the money received by the suppliant was in accordance with the provisional arrangement made, viz: Counsel was to receive a retainer, a refresher and expenses, and a reasonable sum at the conclusion of the business. It is contended on the other side that the word \"gratuity\" should be construed in its technical sense. Now there can be no doubt that what was meant here was, the fee, the honorarium, which cannot be valued in money. It was an obligatory gratuity and is synoymous with quantum meruit.\nMr. Doutre stood on his professional dignity and relied on the rule of the French law, and said I exact so much for expenses and I exact a gratuity at the end. Sir Albert Smith admits it was to be proportioned to the result, and the result in this case was an award of over $5,000,000.\nThe case of Devlin v. The Corporation of Montreal is is not reported, but, as Mr. Justice Taschereau remembers, in that case our Court of Appeal held that Mr. Devlin was entitled to certain fees for professional services rendered to the corporation and for which there was no provision in the tariff. With reference to the value of the services in this case, there is no evidence on the part of the crown.\nThe only other point raised is as to the jurisdiction of this court.\nThe pleadings of the crown gave no intimation of the question which it intended to raise as to the right of a Canadian counsel to bring a petition of right for services as counsel rendered to the crown.\nThe only reference to the right of the petitioner to bring a petition of right is in paragraph 3, which is confined to denying that petitioner was employed for more than two years, and that the expenses incurred by him exceeded eight thousand dollars as alleged, and concludes as follows: \"and I submit that the expenses incurred by the suppliant in connection with his family and the loss alleged in connection with his professional affairs and family and domestic arrangements, form no part of any claim which can be enforced against Her Majesty in the premises by petition of right.\"\nThe respondent, by the pleadings, having confined this objection to expenses, admitted the right of the petitioner to bring a petition of right for services rendered as counsel.\nThe Court of Exchequer in England had and still has jurisdiction in all suits by subjects to recover lands or money from the Crown in England, or it is sometimes termed, the \"Imperial Crown.\"\nIf therefore the suppliant has a remedy at all against the Grown in Canada in respect of his claim in this case, the Court of Exchequer in Canada must have exclusive jurisdiction in that behalf, as the claim of the suppliant is of such a nature as would have come within the jurisdiction of the English Court of Exchequer (Revenue side) in consequence of it being for the recovery of money from the Crown by a subject; section 58 of S. and E. Act. The next question to be considered is whether a subject has, under the circumstances and for the causes in the petition of right alleged, any remedy at all against the Crown.\nSection 19, clause 3, of the Petition of Right Act, declares that \"nothing in said act contained shall give to the subject any remedy against the crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England under similar circumstances by the laws in force there prior to the passing of the Imperial Statute 23 and 24 Vic. c. 34,\" and counsel for the Crown contend that prior to 23 and 24 Vic. a subject would not have been entitled to any remedy against the Crown by the laws in force in England prior to the passing of the said 23 and 24 Vic. under similar circumstances to those under which the suppliant seeks relief in this case, and that therefore the suppliant's petition of right will not lie.\nThe suppliant contends that this is not really a question of jurisdiction, because section 58 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act virtually declares that this court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases in Canada for the recovery of money from the Crown, and the clause of the Petition of Right Act above quoted merely declares that the Petition of Right Act \"shall not give any remedy, &.,\" and does not declare that the court shall not have jurisdiction in such a case if a remedy or right already existed. The real question then to determine is whether the suppliant would have been refused relief as against the Crown prior to 23 and 24 Vic. if he had been proceeding against the Crown in England for similar causes of action incurred under and affected by circumstances similar to those affecting his claim in this suit.\nTo decide this question the phrase \"under similar circumstances\" must be properly construed, as upon the construction of this the solution of the question depends.\nThere have not been cited on behalf of the Crown any authorities, nor can such be found, deciding that if a British subject, being a member of the legal profession in Canada, had been employed by the Crown in England under the circumstances and for purposes similar to those set forth in the suppliant's petition, he would have had by the laws then in force in England no remedy against the Imperial Crown for the value of his services performed pursuant to such retainer or employment.\nThe only argument on the part of the Crown upon this point is one of inference drawn from the fact that it was decided prior to 23 and 24 Vic., that an English Barrister had no right in England to sue for his counsel fees earned in a suit or matter in litigation in any of the English courts of justice.\nThe English cases cited by the counsel for the crown only decide the question of the right of English barristers to sue in England upon a quantum meruit for their remuneration as counsel in suits or proceedings in courts, the judgment in the case of Kennedy v. Broun[26] being distinctly and clearly limited to this point.\nThe suppliant therefore contends that there was no decision against the right of even an English barrister to recover for services such as are claimed for in this suit, the services claimed for having in no sense been rendered in connection with litigation or proceedings in any of the courts of justice.\n\"Similar circumstances\" therefore did not exist in the cases cited by the crown; and the argument deduced from section nineteen of Petition of Right Act and the English cases referred to does not apply to plaintiff's remedy by petition of right in this country. But even if an English barrister could not have recovered for services performed in England, such as have been performed for the crown in Canada by the suppliant, as he is not an English barrister, but a Quebec counsel (including in that term the terms advocate, attorney and proctor) it does not follow that he could not recover.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThe contract relied upon by the respondent in this suit has to be gathered from the evidence of Messrs. Doutre, Whitcher and Sir Albert Smith, and I will therefore cite such portions of their evidence as in my opinion show where the agreement was entered into and what the nature of that agreement was.\nMr. Doutre, in his evidence, after stating that he had written a letter to the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, which contained the basis of the terms upon which he was willing to go to Halifax and act as one of Her Majesty's counsel before the Fishery Commission, says:\nI received a telegram from the Minister to come to Ottawa. I came and had a conversation with him and Mr. Whitcher. The three of us were alone, and this was the only interview that I had on the subject. I insist upon this, because afterwards Sir A. J. Smith pretended that Sir A. T. Galt and Mr. Ford, the British agent, and Mr. Bergne, Secretary of the commission at Halifax, knew something of the arrangement made with me. That could not possibly be, because that was the only occasion on which I had a conversation with the Minister on the subject, and the only person present then was Mr. Whitcher. The Minister had my letter in his hand and he said: I would like to know what you mean by future arrangement as contained in your letter?\" I bad stated that we would settle finally the amount of our remuneration and expenses after the commission would be over: I said, \"I mean that I am too ignorant of the adventure into which I am entering to state precisely what the remuneration should be, I do not know how we will come out of that commission. I have no power to bind my colleagues, and I am making such arrangements as will suit them temporarily until the commission is over, and then it can be settled finally\" I stated that for these two reasons\u2014I could not bind my colleagues, and that I was too much in the dark to determine anything precisely\u2014I insisted upon making some temporary arrangements which would relieve us from money embarrassment while we were away. Then Sir A. J. Smith said: \"Do you mean that if we obtain nothing from the commission you will be lenient, or have mercy upon us, and if we obtain a good award you will expect to te treated liberally?\" I said: \"You may put it on that basis if you like, but it is only then that we will be able to settle the matter.\" This ended the conversation. The $1000 was expected to meet our expenses as we were going to live in a place where we did not know how the expenses might run.\nQ. You proposed then that you should receive $1,000 refresher and $1,000 a month while in Halifax? A. Yes.\nQ. And subsequently to settle for your expenses and fees? A. Yes.\nQ. About what was the date of that interview? A. That interview must have taken place about the 23rd or 24th of May, because on the 25th I wrote to my several colleagues telling them what had been done, and in each of these letters, they stated to me, it was particularly mentioned that the arrangement was purely a temporary one.\nThe letter which I now produce and fyle as exhibit No. 4 was written to Mr. Thomson on the very day that I wrote that letter which is missing. There are two letters dated the 7th May, one to Mr. Thomson and the other to Mr. Weatherbe. The one to Mr. Thomson is as follows:\u2014\"I have just written Hon. A. J. Smith a confidential letter in which I tell him that yourself and Mr. Weatherbe had left in my bands the question of our remuneration as counsel, but that I did not feel like taking the responsibility of committing us to any definite thing, deprived as I was of your advice; that, however, I owed it to you and myself to take the necessary measures to provide for the present and the approaching session of the commissioners, that I thought we were entitled as a mere temporary arrangement to a refresher of $1,000 each, and that provision should be made in your bank in Halifax where we could each draw one thousand dollars a month, beginning on the first of June, adding that our sojourn in Halifax would necessarily be expensive, and that cut as we would be from our base of supply, we should feel at ease in this respect. This leaves the thing intact for future arrangements.\" This was written on the 7th of May, and on the same day I wrote to Mr. Weatherbe to the same effect. Here is a letter written on the 30th of May to Mr. Davies living at Charlottetown, who was at the time Attorney-General in his province. It is as follows: - \"I have been in Ottawa at different intervals, and at a time I met there Messrs. Thomson and Weatherbe. We understood you were prevented from coming by your parliamentary duties. We had spoken together of the advisability of coming to some understanding in regard to pur fees with the Government, but Messrs. Thomson and Weatherbe left without coming to anything in this respect. After their departure I went again to Ottawa with Messrs. Galt, Ford and Bergne, and I submitted the following proposition, viz:\u2014That each of us should receive a refresher equal to the original retainer, and that we be allowed to draw on some bank in Halifax a similar amount to such retainer every month while being there, leaving a final arrangement to be made after the award, giving to understand that if we were not very successful we would ask little or nothing. This last part, however, is verbal only; what is written is that the above proposition would be a temporary arrangement, as I had no right to bind my colleagues. This was agreed upon. You may therefore draw upon W. F. Whitcher, Esq., Commissioner of Fisheries, for an amount equal to your first retainer.\" This was after that interview so that the letters written immediately after my letter to the Minister and the letter written after the interview with the Minister agree together, and all show the agreement between the Minister and myself.\nThen Mr. Doutre produces the following letter which he received from Mr. Whitcher:\nThe entry in my note-book is perfectly correct. Sir A. J. Smith's agreement with you was also discussed before Mr. Ford. If Mr. Weatherbe has made any note different from mine such as makes it appear to be an arrangement acquiesced in by Sir A. J. Smith or Mr. Ford it is incorrect. Your arrangement was made with the Minister, and Mr. Ford assented as agent of the British Government.. My memorandum book shows two entries, one dated 10th of May, 1877, and reads: \"Counsel want $1,000 each as refresher and temporary arrangement for $1000 per month and all expenses paid at Halifax,\" the other is dated 23rd May, 1877: \"agreed with counsel another $1,000 refresher and $1,000 per month during the session of commission, all expenses of travelling and subsistence, and a liberal gratuity on the conclusion of the business.\" These are records of my interviews with the Minister.\nAnd as to the junior counsel, Mr. Doutre says:\nMr. Davies and Mr. Weatherbe, who were retained as junior counsel, were treated as we were\u2014that is, received $1,000 retainer and $1,000 refresher, and $1,000 a month while in Halifax. Q. Is Exhibit No. 12, now fyled, a letter sent to you from Mr. Weatherbe? A. Yes; on the 10th of April, 1879, Mr. Whitcher sent to Judge Weatherbe the following memorandum:\n\"My recollection is clear that Mr. Doutre's letter for self and confrere, stipulating for retainer, refresher and personal expenses, was temporary, and that the final settlement was not to take place until the result of the commission. This was acquiesced in by Sir Albert Smith and Mr. Ford. I was present at the discussion. My note book contains the following:\"\u2014\nThen follow the entries that I have already read.\nMr. Whitcher stating what took place after the receipt of Mr. Doutre's letter, with regard to the remuneration of counsel, gives the following evidence:\nI remember one particular instance when he pressed for a decision as well for the other counsel as on his own behalf. That was the occasion, if I recollect rightly, when this letter was discussed, but there had been other discussions at intervals prior to that.\nQ. What took place at that interview? A. It would be difficult to say what occurred, there was so much conversation.\nQ. Who was present? A. I was present but took no part in the conversation.\nQ. Who else was present? A. The Minister and Mr. Doutre.\nQ. This letter, you say, was discussed: was any definite arrangement arrived at? A. The general character of the conversation was, that the Minister seemed a little unwilling to leave the thing open, and was pressing for some definite terms, as I understood it. It ended in an understanding that this would be a temporary arrangement so far as it was not specified, that is to say, there was to be $1,000 paid for retainer, $1,000 for refresher and $1,000 per month while the commission sat. There was some difference as to the junior counsel, but that is not pertinent to this. Further remuneration to these amounts was to form the subject of after consideration. I do not pretend to recite the words used; there were so many conversations that it would be impossible to remember them all.\nQ. Did you make a note of the conversation?\nA. Yes; as I was paymaster throughout the whole of the commission, I kept memoranda of all agreements.\n* * * * * * * *\nQ. Have you the memorandum now here?\nA. I have. There is an entry on the 10th May, 1877, I may state that there were discussions constantly going on as to the counsel, Professor Hind, Mr. Miall, and others engaged upon the commission. This entry is amongst Others, and is as follows:\u2014\"Counsel want $1,000 each as refresher and temporary arrangement for $1,000 per month and all expenses paid at Halifax.\"\nThis, if I connect it rightly in my memory, was the occasion when the Minister asked Mr. Doutre to reduce the proposition to writing. Further on I find, amongst a number of others, entries dated 23rd of May, the following:\u2014\"Agreed with counsel another $1,000 refresher, and $1,000 per m. during session of commission, all expenses of travelling and subsistence and a liberal gratuity on the conclusion of business.\"\nI do not say that these are the exact words, but they are the substance of what I was to consider my directions.\n* * * * * * * *\nQ. Were all the counsel to get the same remuneration?\nA. No; The first arrangement was that Mr. Doutre and Mr. Thomson were to receive $1,000 each, and Mr. Weatherbe and Mr. Davies $600 each, but at the conclusion, in consequence of this successful issue, and the amount of labor, I suppose, all the counsel were put upon the same footing. I paid them the advanced rate by the authority of the Minister.\n* * * * * * * *\nQ. The next arrangement was that of the 23rd of May? A. Yes.\nQ. Where was that made? A. In the Ministers room.\nQ. Who was present? A. I recollect Mr. Doutre, the Minister and myself.\nQ. With whom was the arrangement made\u2014with the Minister or with you? It was not with me.\nQ. You took no part in making the arrangement? A. I took no part in it.\nQ. Did the Minister seem anxious that a final arrangement should be made? A. He preferred it.\nQ. And Mr. Doutre preferred that a final arrangement should not be made? A. He preferred for the satisfaction of himself and the other counsel that it should be settled afterwards.\nQ. Did the Minister suggest a final arrangement? A. I do not recollect the Minister suggesting anything, but the result of it was & temporary arrangement.\n* * * * * * * *\nThe liberal gratuity was to be included. I may not have been very accurate in punctuating the entry. The words are\u2014\"And $1,000 per month during session of commission, all expenses, travel and subsistence, and a liberal gratuity on conclusion of business.\"\nSir Albert Smith's evidence as to this agreement is as follows: Q. Will you state what arrangement was made?\nA. My memory of the conversation is this: they had already received $1,000 retainer, and we were to give them $1,000, which I understood to be a compensation for services up to that time. After that we were to give them $1,000 a month while in Halifax, and Mr. Doutre suggested that in case we succeeded in obtaining a handsome award it would be a matter for the Government to consider whether they were to get a gratuity after the case was over. That was my understanding.\nQ. Then $2,000 would be the amount in full up to that time?\nA. Yes, that was my understanding. Mr. Doutre said, I recollect distinctly, something about some gratuity, if we should succeed in getting a handsome award, that then it would be a matter for the Government to consider whether they would make a gratuity.\nQ. But the contract for payment was limited to $1,000? A. Yes.\nQ. And anything further than that was to be a gratuity?\nA, That was my understanding of it and that is what I communicated to my colleagues and to Mr. Ford, I know that Mr. Ford and I discussed the question. Mr. Doutre knows that too, I told him more then once that I would have to communicate the matter to Mr. Ford.\nI think it cannot be doubted that everything that had taken place up to the time of the making of the alleged contract was considered as fully paid up and satisfied, and that the arrangement at Ottawa, which forms the basis of this suit, was without regard to the past but solely in reference to the sittings of the commission at Halifax In negotiating this arrangement, authorized or not, Mr. Doutre unquestionably at Ottawa acted for the other counsel as well as for himself in reference to the remuneration for services to be performed at Halifax. That he did so, his letters to these gentlemen place beyond question. Whether authorized or not, he acted for them and in their name, he communicated to them that he had done so, and, so far from any repudiation on their part, they unquestionably not only acquiesed but in the most unequivocal manner adopted his act and in accordance with it drew the money thereby arranged to be paid.\nIf this arrangement was not made in Ottawa to be carried out in Nova Scotia, but is to be treated as a Quebec contract as regards Mr. Doutre, I should like to understand how it is to be treated as regards the other counsel, for by one and the same arrangement, arranged by one and the same person, at one and the same time, and at one and the same place, viz., at Ottawa, the services of one and all of the counsel were to be remunerated, and by which, it cannot be doubted, that one and all were finally to be placed on the same footing\u2014though it was at first contemplated that the remuneration of the juniors was to be on a smaller scale, which, however, was subsequently rectified, and it was finally arranged that all should fare alike. In addition to which this cause was tried and decided as on an Ontario contract, and Mr. Doutre was examined and proved his case as the principal witness, which he could not have done in the province of Quebec.\nI am of opinion that the arrangement between the suppliant and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, relied on in this case as a binding contract, took place at Ottawa, in reference to services to be performed by Mr. Doutre, as a barrister and Queen's counsel in Nova Scotia, and not in Quebec, and is not to be governed by the law of Quebec. In my opinion, the law in Ontario and Nova. Scotia is the same as to the right of a barrister to maintain an action for counsel fees, and therefore it is immaterial whether the law of the place where the arrangement was entered into, viz., Ontario, or where the services were to be performed, viz., Nova Scotia, is to govern.\nI concur in the views as enunciated by Chief Justice Robinson in Baldwin et al., v. Montgomery[27], and by Chief Justice Harrison in McDougall v. Campbell[28], and as held in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in re Bayard[29], and in Keir v. Burns[30], viz: that independent of statute counsel fees are not the subject-matter of debt to be recoverable in an action by a barrister as a remuneration for his services; that the same rule applies in the provinces where the common law prevails, as in England, and must govern until altered by the legislature, as was done in New Brunswick in the case of physicians by the act 56 Geo. III. c. 16.\nChipman, C. J., in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in re Bayard[31] says:\nAlthough fees to counsel are considered honorary, that is, not the subject-matter of debt to be recoverable in an action by a barrister, as a remuneration for his services, yet the reason of this is not that the barrister is supposed to bestow his services gratuitously, but that he should always be paid beforehand, because counsel are not to be left to the chance whether they shall ultimately get their fees or not\u2014their emoluments are not to depend on the event of the cause. This is fully set out in the case of Morris v. Hunt[32]. In this case Bayley, J. says: \"It is the duty of counsel to take care if they have fees that they have them beforehand, and therefore the law will not allow them any remedy if they disregard their duty in that respect. The same rule applies to the case of a physician, who cannot maintain any action for his fees.\" Such is the state of things in England, and although in this province, as in most of the other British colonies, the position of the profession differs much from that in England, from the necessity which exists of uniting in the same person the office of barrister and attorney, the duties of which are frequently much blended, and the attorney is often, as it would appear to have been in the present case, the only counsel for his client, we do not think that the lien of the attorney here on the money in his hands can go beyond what it is in England. The same rule must govern in both countries until it is altered by the legislature, as has been done in this Province in the case of physicians by the Act 56 Geo. III. c. 16.\nIn the case of Baldwin et al. v. Montgomery[33], Chief Justice Robinson in Ontario then Upper Canada says:\nThe principle of law will apply which denies to counsel and physicians the right to sue for their professional services; a principle which, it is thought in England, for the advantage as well as for the honor of the profession, should be maintained in force, and for reasons which apply here equally as in England.\nIn the case of Kerr v. Burns[34], Carter, C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, to which I was a party, says:\nOn the other question arising in this case, namely, the right of a barrister to maintain an action against his client for professional services, we entertain no doubt whatever. The only cases cited in favor of this right were from the courts of the United States, and in those very cases it is admitted that the decisions are at variance with the law of England. We feel ourselves bound by the law of England, even if we doubted its policy, a matter on which, however, we are entirely free from doubt. The system under which the bar of England has existed for centuries, and maintained its acknowledged character of independence and honourable usefulness, ought to be sufficient for the bar of a British colony; and we think we should be materially injuring the position and efficiency of the bar, were we to change that system, and enable them to recover as for ordinary work or labour, on a quantum meruit. That dignity and standing in court which is supposed to appertain to a barrister, would hardly be raised by his appearance as a witness in his own case, to rate his own forensic talent and learning at his own estimate, to hear them depreciated by his own client and his professional rivals, and to have them finally judged by a tribunal, not perhaps very adequately qualified to appreciate his real merits.\nSince the cases of Baldwin v. Montgomery, in re Bay ard and Kerr v. Burns were decided, we have the celebrated case of Kennedy v. Broun[35], in which it was distinctly held that the relation of counsel and client rendered the parties mutually incapable of making any contract of hiring and service concerning advocacy in litigation, and that a promise made by a client to pay money to a counsel for his advocacy, whether made before, during, or after the litigation, had no binding effect; and in the equally celebrated case of Swinfen v. Lord Chelmsford[36], Pollock, C. B., delivering the judgment of the court, says: We are all of opinion that an advocate at the English bar, accepting a brief in the usual way, undertakes a duty, but does not enter into any contract or promise, express, or implied. Cases may indeed occur where on an express promise (if he made one) he would be liable in assumpsit, but we think a barrister is to be considered, not as making a contract with his client, but as taking upon himself an office or duty in the proper discharge of which, not merely the client, but the court in which the duty is to be performed and the public at large have an interest.\nIn Kennedy v. Broun[37], Erle, C. J., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nHe is entrusted with interests and privileges and powers almost to an unlimited degree. His client must rely on him at times for fortune and character and life. The law trusts him with a privilege in respect of liberty of speech, which is in practice bounded only by his own sense of duty; and he may have to speak upon subjects concerning the deepest interests of social life, and the innermost feelings of the human soul. The law also trusts him with a power of insisting on answers to the most painful questioning; and this power, again, is in practice only controlled by his own view of the interests of truth. It is of the last importance that the sense of duty should be in active energy proportioned to the magnitude of these interests. If the law is that the advocate is incapable of contracting for hire to serve when he has undertaken an advocacy, his words and acts ought to be guided by a sense of duty, that is to say, duty to his client, binding him to exert every faculty and privilege and power in order that he may maintain that client's right, together with duty to the court and himself, binding him to guard against abuse of the powers and privileges intrusted to him, by a constant recourse to his own sense of right.\nIf an advocate with these qualities stands by the client in time of his utmost need, regardless alike of popular clamour and powerful interest, speaking with a boldness which a sense of duty can alone recommend, we say the service of such an advocate is beyond all price to his client; and such men are the guarantees for the maintenance of his dearest rights; and the words of such men carry a wholesome spirit to all who are influenced by them. * *\nSuch is the system of advocacy intended by the law requiring the remuneration to be by gratuity. * * * *\nOn principle, then, as well as on authority, we think that there is a good reason for holding that the relation of counsel and client in litigation creates the incapacity to make a contract of hiring as an advocate. It follows that the requests and promises of the defendant, and the services of the plaintiff created neither an obligation nor an inception of obligation, nor any inchoate right whatever capable of being completed and made into a contract by any subsequent promise. * * * * * *\nWith respect to the claim for compensation for leaving Birmingham and coming to London and for services in issuing publications for the purpose of creating a prepossession in favour of the defendant, there are several answers, of which two will suffice, The first is that these services were auxilliary to the service as an advocate; and, if the principal service could not be the subject of a contract, neither could any service which was merely accessory thereto, and of no value without the principal. * * * *\nOf the judgment in the case of Kennedy v. Broun, Chief Justice Harrison of Ontario thus speaks in McDougall v. Campbell[38];\nIt has in England horn time immemorial been considered essential to the honor and dignity of the bar that there should be no traffic about counsel fees, no power to make contracts of hiring and service in reference to them. This has become a well understood and generally respected canon of English law. Under its operation there has existed in England for centuries as able, learned and distinguished a bar as ever existed in any, or does exist in any part of the world. If the preservation of the canon be necessary in England, it is, in my opinion, none the less necessary in this province, where the professions of barrister and attorney are often united in the same person, and where the dignity and zeal of the barrister, if not carefully guarded, is in danger of being lost in the mere zeal of an attorney. The bar of this province has not suffered from the limited operation of the English rule. Personally, I deplore that there has ever been any encroachment on the integrity of the English rule. And if there is to be any further encroachment, the work will not be mine or with my assent. If the days should ever come when barristers, instead of being paid their fees when retained, may contract for future payment, and sue in the event of non-payment, and be sued for nonperformance of contract, as in the case of an ordinary contract for hiring and service, I do not think the public will gain anything, and I am sure the profession will lose by the change.\nThe public and the profession have in truth a common interest in maintaining the honor and dignity of the bar. In a country like ours, where honor and dignity depend more on personal conduct than on trappings of office, nothing should be done which would have a tendency in personal conduct to lessen the honor and dignity so essential to the maintenance of a high standard of professional rectitude at the bar. As said by Erle, C. J., in Kennedy v. Broun, 13 C. B. N. S. 677, 738: \"If the law allowed the advocate to make a contract of hiring and service, it may be that his mind would be lowered, and that his performance would be guided by the words of his contract rather than by principles of duty,\u2014that words, sold and delivered according to contract for the purpose of earning hire, would fail of creating sympathy and persuasion in proportion as they were suggestive of effrontery and selfishness, and that the standard of duty throughout the whole class of advocates would be degraded.\"\nThe same distinguished judge in the same instructive judgment (p. 737) also uses these works: \"The incapacity of the advocate in litigation to make a contract of hiring affects the integrity and dignity of advocates, and so is in close relation with the highest of human interests, viz.: the administration of justice.\"\nI confess I never read this inspiriting judgment without, if possible, having increased veneration and increased love for the profession to which I owe so much.\nIt may be a weakness on my part, but it is a weakness in which I believe I shall glory as strength as long as I have any being.\nI am not unimpressed with what my brother Gwynne says as to the effect of the Petition of Right Act in this case, but as I have a strong opinion on a ground raised and argued at the bar which is an answer to the case, I prefer resting my judgment on this point, which to my mind is clear. As the question suggested by my brother Gwynne has not been as fully argued before us as I should like it to be, without a full discussion of this important point, I should not like to express an opinion.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am unable to aquiesce in the judgment just delivered by the Chief Justice, for I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the suppliant, an advocate of the Province of Quebec, practising and having his domicile in that Province, is disentitled to recover fees for professional services, for the reason that he performed such services at Halifax in Nova Scotia, under an agreement made with the Government of the Dominion, having its seat at Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario, through the intervention of a minister of the Crown. For, assuming that by the law of both the Provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia no action can be maintained for counsel fees, I doubt if the law of those Provinces is applicable to the present case, for I incline to think the right to recover depends on the law of Quebec, which recognizes a legal liability to pay counsel fees upon a quantum meruit as well as under an express agreement. Denial of the right to recover counsel fees in England is, as I gather from Lord C. J. Erle's most learned judgment, in Kennedy v. Broun[39], not based on any principles of policy applicable to the public at large, but merely on the long usage of the English bar, and on principles of policy established in the interests of the profession. I consider therefore, that the decision referred to merely establishes that an English barrister, who, by the rules of his profession, is presumed always to render his professional services for honorary fees only, cannot maintain an action for them, and not that such a rule would apply to a foreign advocate who was not prohibited, either by the law of his domicile, or by the usages governing the profession to which he belonged, from enforcing a legal remedy for his remuneration.\nFurther, even if the laws of Ontario or Nova Scotia were applicable, I should hesitate long before I acceded to the proposition, that a rule, which seems to me to be founded principally on historical reasons and others incidental to the professional status of the bar in England, was a part of the common law of England which had been introduced into the provinces in question, in both of which the distinction which is so carefully preserved in England between the professions of barrister and attorney is entirely disregarded, the great majority of the profession practising in both characters. I am aware that there are decisions in Ontario adverse to this view, but I consider the late case of McDougall v. Campbell[40] as throwing so much doubt on these cases that they are no longer to be relied on.\nWhilst, however, expressing these doubts as a reason for not being able to rest my judgment on the same grounds as those expressed by the Chief Justice, I desire to be understood as giving no opinion upon the questions referred to, which it is unnecessary I should do, since it appears to me, after a very careful consideration of the evidence, that by the terms of the agreement between the suppliant and Sir Albert Smith, as proved by the suppliant's own evidence, and that of his witness, Mr. Whitcher, as well as by the testimony of Sir Albert Smith, the suppliant is precluded from setting up any legal right to recover fees for the services rendered by him to the Government, beyond the amount which has been admittedly paid to him. The passages in the evidence to which I refer, areas follows:\nMr. Doutre, in his evidence, says:\nI insisted upon making some temporary arrangements which would relieve us from money embarrassment while we were away. Then Sir A. J. Smith said: \"Do you mean that if we obtain nothing from the commission you will be lenient, or have mercy upon us, and if we obtain a good award you will expect to be treated liberally?\" I said \"you may put it on that basis if you like, but it is only then that we will be able to settle the matter.\" This ended the conversation. The $1,000 were expected to meet our expenses, as we were going to live in a place where we did not know how the expenses might run. Mr. Whitcher:\nQ. Have you the memorandum here? A. I have. There is an entry on the 10th of May, 1877. I may state that there were discussions constantly going on as to the counsel, Professor Hind, Mr. Miall and others engaged upon the commission. This entry is amongst others, and is as follows:\u2014\"Counsel want $1,000 each as refresher and temporary arrangement for $1,000 per month and all expenses paid at Halifax.\"\nThis, if I connect it rightly in my memory, was the occasion when the Minister asked Mr. Doutre to reduce the proposition to writing. Further on I find amongst a number of other entries dated 23rd of May, the following: \"Agreed with counsel another $1,000 refresher and $1,000 per m. during session of commission, all expenses of travelling and subsistence and a liberal gratuity on the conclusion of business.\"\nI do not say that these are the exact words, but they are the substance of what I was to consider my directions.\nQ. You wrote to Mr. Doutre, I believe, giving a copy of those memoranda, look at the exhibit produced and say whether it is a correct copy of the entries that you have read? A. It is my handwriting, but I am inclined to think that it was written subsequently to one for the use of the Department of Justice, at the time that Mr. Doutre and the other counsel were appealing for a consideration of their claims. We communicated them officially to the Department of Justice, after having been asked to report the substance of the agreement with the counsel. This having been called in question, I find that I wrote a note to Mr. Doutre stating that the entry in my note-book was perfectly correct, and giving him the memorandum.\nQ. You had previously sent memoranda of those discussions to the Department of Justice? A. Yes. This note that you have produced was marked \"private,\" and should not have been produced in this case. My time was very much occupied with the duties of my office and I would naturally communicate the information asked from me more freely than I would have done if I had supposed that it would be produced as evidence in a legal case. The note corresponds in substance with the entries that I made in my note-book.\nQ. Were these memoranda made at the time? A. Yes.\nSir Albert Smith:\nQ. Do you remember having an interview with Mr. Doutre with reference to the compensation that he was to receive as counsel? A. Yes.\nQ. Will you state what that interview was? A. I think that Mr. Doutre and I had several conversations on the subject, but I do not recollect of having any conversation with the other counsel at all as to their compensation. A short time before the commission opened at Halifax, Mr. Doutre was in my office. He referred to it in his evidence, and Mr. Whitcher did also. I think Mr. Whitcher was present on that occasion.\nQ. Will you state what arrangement was made? A. My memory of the conversation is this: they had already received $1000 retainer, and we were to give them $1,000, which I understood to be a compensation for services up to that time. After that we were to give them $1,000 a month while in Halifax, and Mr. Doutre suggested that in case we succceded in obtaining a handsome award it would be a matter for the Government to consider whether they were to get a gratuity after the case was over. That was my understanding.\nQ. Then $2,000 would be the amount in full up to that time? A. Yes, that was my understanding. Mr. Doutre said, I recollect distinctly, something about some gratuity, if we should succeed in getting a handsome award that then it would be a matter for the Government to consider whether they would make a gratuity.\nQ. But the contract for payment was limited to $1,000? A. Yes.\nQ. And anything further than that was to be a gratuity? A. That was my understanding of it, and that is what I communicated to my colleagues and to Mr. Ford. I know that Mr. Ford and I discussed the question. Mr. Doutre knows that, too. I told him more than once that I would have to communicate the matter to Mr. Ford.\nQ. That $1,000 a month, while in Halifax, was to cover both the services and expenses? A.I understood it so. I remember that Mr. Doutre stated on this occasion that he intended to take his family to Halifax, but that was a matter that I did not think the Government would be justified in paying the expenses. That was personal to himself.\nThe effect of this evidence is, in my opinion, to establish beyond question that the engagement entered into by Sir Albert Smith on behalf of the Government to pay any fees in excess of the $1,000 per month during the sittings of the commission was purely honorary.\nThis I take to be the plain meaning of Mr. Doutre's own statement, when he says that Sir Albert put the question to him:\nDo you mean that if we obtain nothing from the commission you will be lenient or have mercy upon us, and if we obtain a good award you will expect to be treated liberally? To which, question Mr. Doutre replied:\nYou may put it on that basis if you like, but it is only then we will be able to settle the matter.\nTherefore had we nothing but Mr. Doutre's own statement, I should consider that, so far from there having been any express contract to pay a reasonable remuneration for the services of counsel in excess of the $1,000 per month, there was an express engagement on his part to trust to the honour and liberality of the Government. But the evidence of Mr. Whitcher, the Commissioner of Fisheries, a witness called by the claimant, puts this beyond all doubt, for in the memorandum made by him at the time of the interview of the 23rd May, 1877, between Sir Albert Smith and Mr. Doutre, it is in so many words expressed, that any sum to be paid at the conclusion of the arbitration in excess of the $1,000 per month, was not to be a matter of right but a \"gratuity.\" It is to be observed that this memorandum is not objected to by Mr. Doutre, but is expressly recognized by him as containing a correct record of the arrangement come to by him with the Minister. Mr. Whitcher says he believes he made the memorandum in question, in the usual way, the moment he returned from the Minister's room to his desk. A copy of this memorandum also appears to have been sent by Mr. Whitcher to the Department of Justice as containing a correct record of what had passed at the interview in question.\nMr. Whitcher having stated that his memorandum correctly embodied the substance of the conversation between Mr. Doutre and the Minister, and having represented it in the way I have mentioned, as correctly embodying the substance of the conversation, I cannot consider the signification which, in a subsequent part of his evidence, he attaches to the word \"gratuity,\" as meaning an unascertained sum or remuneration to be subsequently fixed, as materially varying its force and effect, more especially as the memorandum appears to have been adopted by Mr. Doutre in the terms in which it was expressed, and is, as regards the use of the word \"gratuity,\" in its ordinary signification, entirely corroborated by Sir Albert Smith's testimony and not inconsistent with that of Mr. Doutre himself.\nSir Albert Smith states that the arrangement was that, if a handsome award was obtained, it would be for the Government to consider whether they would make a gratuity. This evidence, in my opinion, clearly shows that Mr. Doutre agreed to trust to the honour and generosity of the Government to pay any fees in excess of the $1,000 per month The consequence must be that, not only is such an honorary and gratuitous undertaking no foundation for an action, but it excludes any right of action as upon an implied contract to pay the reasonable value of the services rendered, assuming that the law is as the suppliant contends, that such an action would, in the absence of an express agreement, have been maintainable. That this is the legal effect, if the view I take of the evidence is correct, is manifest from numerous authorities, of which I may mention one or two. Mr. Pollock, in his learned work on Contracts[41], after referring to the case of Taylor v. Brewer, which I will presently mention more fully, thus clearly states the principle:\nMoreover, a promise of this kind, though it creates no enforceable contract, is so far effectual as to exclude the promisee from falling back on any contract to pay a reasonable remuneration, which would be inferred from the transaction, if there was no express agreement at all.\nIn Roberts v. Smith[42],\nThere was an agreement between A and B, that B should perform certain services, and that in the event (let us say No. 1) A should pay B a certain salary, but that in another event (No. 2) A should pay B whatever A might think reasonable. Event No. 2 having happened, the court held there was no contract which B could enforce. Services had indeed been rendered, and of the sort for which people usually are paid and expect to be paid, so that in the absence of express agreement there would have been a good cause of action for a reasonable reward. But here B had expressly assented to take whatever A should think reasonable, which might be nothing, and had thus precluded himself from claiming to have whatever a jury should think reasonable.\nIn Taylor v. Brewer[43] the bankrupt, of whom the plaintiff was the assignee, had performed work for a committee under a resolution entered into by them \"that any service to be rendered by him should be taken into consideration, and such remuneration be made as should be deemed right.\" Lord Ellenborough, C. J., in giving judgment says:\nBut here, I own it, I think there was an engagement accepted by the bankrupt on no definite terms, but only on confidence that if his labour deserved anything he should be recompensed for it by the defendants. This was throwing himself upon the mercy of those with whom he contracted, and the same thing does not unfrequently happen in contracts with several of the departments of Government.\nGrove, J., said:\nI consider the resolution to import that the committee were to udge whether any or what recompense was right.\nLe Blanc, J.:\nIt seems to me to be merely an engagement of honor.\nBayley, J.:\nThe fair meaning of the resolution is this: that it was to be in the breast of the committee whether he was to have anything, and if anything, then, how much?\nThe case of Roberts v. Smith, cited in the extract given from Mr. Pollock's work, followed this case of Taylor v. Brewer, and is, as already stated, to the same effect; and the case of Bryant v. Flight[44], in which a contrary opinion was held by a majority of the court, Baron Parke dissenting, must be taken as overruled by Roberts v. Smith[45].\nIt appears to me very clear, therefore, that the suppliant performed the services for which he sues under an agreement with the government which disentitles him to maintain his petition of right.\nHe must be taken to have relied exclusively upon the honour, good faith and liberality of those who employed him, and not on any binding legal obligation to pay.\nThere was, however, in addition to the arrangement about the gratuity for services to be rendered, an express agreement to pay Mr. Doutre's disbursements for travelling in going to and returning from Halifax, and his expenses at Halifax, which seems to me to depend on different considerations. I know of no authority deciding that, even in England, a counsel leaving home to perform professional services may not legally stipulate that his client shall pay his expenses. No instances of such a question having ever arisen is to be found in the books, it is true, but this is probably for the reason that the etiquette of the bar there forbids such an agreement. However that may be, such agreements are not unusual in this country, and I find nothing to warrant me in holding that they are not valid.\nI am therefore of opinion that the suppliant is entitled to recover his travelling expenses, and also his personal expenses of living at Halifax. I should have mentioned that Sir Albert Smith denies that' any such arrangement to pay expenses was come to, but I think I must adopt Mr. Whitcher's memorandum, which was a written record of the agreement made at the time, as correctly stating the terms which were arrived at, and this clearly states that the expenses were to be paid extra.\nThe evidence does not contain sufficient material to enable me to fix the amount of these expenses, and I therefore think there should be a reference to the registrar to take an account of the claimant's reasonable personal expenses whilst travelling to and from Halifax, and whilst in attendance upon the Commission under his retainer at Halifax.\nFOURNIER, J., adhered to the judgment delivered by him in the court below.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nI agree in the conclusion that there was an agreement entered into between the Government and the respondent that \"the final amount of fees or remuneration to be paid to counsel would remain unsettled until after the award of the commissioners.\" Mr. Whitcher, in his evidence, used the word \"gratuity,\" but it is clear that term was not used in its technical sense, but that all parties intended that some reasonable amount should be given in addition to the sum agreed to be paid down.\nThe first objection was that the counsel could not recover for his fees at all in a petition, of right. I have satisfied myself that a counsel should recover for his fees in this country. Here a counsel stands on a very different footing from that of an English barrister. The duties of professional gentlemen here are very different from those of the English counsel, and I am of opinion, therefore, that it would be improper to introduce in this country the rule which prevails in England, viz.: that a counsel fee is a mere honorarium and cannot be recovered by action. Here counsel act as attornies, solicitors and advocates at the same time, and their duties are not separated, and they ought not to be denied the right to recover the value of their services as such. It has been decided in Quebec, and it has been all but decided in Ontario, and I take it to be the policy here, that everybody should be paid for the services he renders. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that counsel can recover here for any fees that they have contracted for in exchange for their services. I do not see why the law should be otherwise in this country. The only difficulty I had was, that inasmuch as the statute says that a subject can recover against the Crown only in such cases as a subject could recover in England, whether under the petition of Right Act the suppliant could recover against the Crown, as in England he could not recover in a similar action.\nI have arrived at the conclusion that where there is a contract between the subject and the Crown, and the subject alleges a breach of that contract, a petition of right will lie. Although an English counsel could not recover in England on a similar contract, yet the intention of Parliament was that all contracts entered into with the Dominion Government could be enforced in the Exchequer Court.\nAs to the damages, I do not think that the amount awarded is unreasonable. We all know that parties are put to extraordinary expense when they are obliged to leave their homes and reside in a strange city attending a matter of such importance as the one on which the suppliant was employed. In the old country a much larger bill would have been charged and paid, and in such matters it is usual to provide liberally.\nUnder all the circumstances I am in favour of dismissing the appeal. TASCHEREAU, J.:\nJ'en suis aussi venu \u00e0 la conclusion, avec mon honorable coll\u00e8gue qui vient d'opiner, que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, quoique sur des motifs un peu diff\u00e9rents des siens.\nJe suis d'avis que cette cause doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gie par le droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec; en premier lieu, parce que c'est \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al que l'Intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u la lettre du ministre de la Justice demandant ses services, et c'est \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al que l'Intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 cette demande, et s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 donner ses services comme un des avocats du gouvernement canadien devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries, Et en second lieu, et surtout parce que je consid\u00e8re qu'un des membres du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui accepte la charge d'une affaire quelconque comme avocat, le fait, ne peut le faire, que comme avocat de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme membre du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et que tout ce qu'il fait comme avocat, quel que soit le lieu o\u00f9 il exerce sa profession, soit en Angleterre, devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9, ou ailleurs, quel que soit le lieu o\u00f9 ses services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 actuellement demand\u00e9s et retenus, il le fait \u00e0 titre d'avocat et de membre du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et avec ses droits et privil\u00e8ges comme tel. De fait, il n'est avocat qu'\u00e0 ce titre. Il peut, en certaines circonstances, exercer sa profession en dehors de cette province, mais c'est toujours \u00e0 titre d'avocat de cette province qu'il le fait. Le client qui retient ses services pour \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s en dehors de la province se met, dans ses relations avec lui, sur le pied ordinaire d'un client vis-\u00e0-vis d'un avocat de la province, dans la province. Par exemple, si pendant que M. Doutre se trouve \u00e0 Ottawa, un client le retient pour aller plaider une cause devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9, ce ne sera pas la loi d'Ontario, quoique le contrat y ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, ni la loi Imp\u00e9riale quoique les services soient rendus en Angleterre, qui r\u00e9giront les relations entre M. Doutre et son client, mais bien la loi dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec; parce que ce client ne l'a retenu et engag\u00e9 que comme avocat, et que M. Doutre est avocat de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te n'est avocat qu'\u00e0 ce titre.\nDe la part de Sa Majest\u00e9, il est d'ailleurs admis, quoique ni\u00e9 d'abord, que la cause de la pr\u00e9sente action a pris naissance dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. A la page 3 du factum, au soutien de l'appel, je lis:\nIt is submitted that a new trial should be ordered on the ground of the reception of improper evidence, viz:\n(1.) The Suppliant's own evidence\u2014the cause of action having arisen in the Province of Quebec, and the suppliant's evidence therefore not being admissible.\nEtant pos\u00e9 le principe que la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec r\u00e9git cette cause, la question de savoir si une action en justice comp\u00e8te \u00e0 M. Doutre pour le recouvrement de ses honoraires comme un des avocats de Sa Majest\u00e9 devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries se trouve tranch\u00e9e. Car, sous le r\u00e9gime de cette loi, cette question ne souffre pas de doute. Voir Amyot v. Gugy[46] et les autorit\u00e9s y cit\u00e9es aussi Devlin v. Tumblety[47], Beaudry v. Ouimet[48], Grimard v. Burroughs[49], Vandal v. Gauthier[50], Larue v. Loranger[51]. Aussi, dans le m\u00eame sens, Grimard v. Burroughs[52]. Voir aussi l'arr\u00eat de la cour de Cassation du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1818 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Favard[53].\nDans une cause de Devlin v. la Corporation de Montr\u00e9al, la Cour d'Appel, le 13 mars 1878, accorda \u00e0 M. Devlin $2,500 pour ses honoraires comme avocat de la Corporation sur les expropriations requises pour le Parc (Mount Royal Park) sur une preuve de la valeur des services du demandeur faite dans la cause, aucun tarif existant pour tels services, confirmant le principe du jugement rendu en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure par le juge Johnson, le 30 mai 1877, quoique r\u00e9duisant le montant qu'il avait accord\u00e9. Le passage du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,\u2014sur la partie de la demande pour honoraires sur les expropriations pour le parc, est comme suit:\nConsidering also that from the professional and other evidence adduced by Plaintiff, it was proved that the said mentioned services were worth the sum of ten thousand dollars; and further that in the Judgment of this Court, after duly weighing such evidence, the said Plaintiff is entitled to receive from the Defendant for such last mentioned services four thousand dollars.\nLe jugement de la Cour d'Appel dit:\nConsidering also that in the Judgment of this Court after duly weighing such evidence the said Respondent (Devlin) is entitled to receive from the Appellants (The Corporation of Montreal) for such last mentioned services (on Mount Royal Park expropriations) two thousand five hundred dollars.\nC'est bien l\u00e0, admettre dans les deux Cours, qu'un avocat peut recouvrer la valeur de ses services sur le quantum meruit, quand ses services sont rendus hors de cour ou ne sont pas pr\u00e9vus par le tariff.\nGrimard vs. Burroughs et Larue vs. Loranger ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9 comme contraires \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation de l'Intim\u00e9. Mais, en y r\u00e9f\u00e9rant on verra que les d\u00e9cisions dans ces causes vont \u00e0 dire que quand il y a un tarif d'honoraires l'avocat et procureur ne peut exiger de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que le tarif, quand il n'y a pas eu engagement sp\u00e9cial de la part du client de lui payer plus que les honoraires accord\u00e9s par le tarif. Il est \u00e9vident, en cons\u00e9quence, que ces causes n'ont pas d'application ici. Il n'y avait pas de tarif pour les avocats engag\u00e9s devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries. Je r\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi aux articles 1722 et 1732 C.C. Aussi \u00e0 l'art. 2260 (10. qui dit que l'action de l'avocat est prescrite par cinq ans.

Doutre ne pouvait \u00eatre entendu comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande, et que son t\u00e9moignage produit au dossier comme t\u00e9moin entendu pour lui-m\u00eame, ne peut \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l'examen de cette cause. La section 63 de l'acte qui constitue la Cour de l'Echiquier, 38 Vict., ch. 11, \u00e9nacte sp\u00e9cialement que:\nIssues of fact, in cases before the said Court, shall be tried according to the laws of the Province in which the cause originated, including the laws of evidence. Et la section 13 de l'acte 39 Vict., ch. 27, \u00e9tend cette clause aux petitions of right.\nAvant d'entrer dans l'examen des t\u00e9moignages produits au dossier il faut constater quelle est la contestation li\u00e9e entre les partis, the matters in issue, tel qu'appert au dossier. D'abord, quelle est la demande du p\u00e9titionnaire?\u2014Purement et simplement une action bas\u00e9e sur le quantum meruit pour services professionnels rendus pour Sa Majest\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa demande devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries, et pour la pr\u00e9paration de la cause de Sa Majest\u00e9 devant la dite commission, avec en outre une obligation r\u00e9clamant les d\u00e9penses encourues par le p\u00e9titionnaire dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses devoirs comme tel avocat, et donnant ses d\u00e9penses comme se montant \u00e0 plus de $8,000, et un autre all\u00e9guant que le p\u00e9titionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pendant plus de deux ans \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cutiou de ses dits devoirs. Le p\u00e9titionnaire ajoute qu'il a re\u00e7u une somme de $8,000 sur le paiement de ses services, pour laquelle il cr\u00e9dite Sa Majest\u00e9. Il all\u00e8gue aussi que par un arrangement provisoire avec le d\u00e9partement des P\u00eacheries, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu, avant son d\u00e9part pour Halifax, o\u00f9 la Commission devait si\u00e9ger, que le gouvernement lui paierait $1,000 par mois pour ses d\u00e9penses courantes durant son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Halifax, laissant le r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif, tant des d\u00e9penses que des honoraires du p\u00e9titionnaire, \u00e0 \u00eatre fait apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture des travaux de la Commission. Tels sont les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s essentiels de la demande.\nPour Sa Majest\u00e9, le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Puissance a plaid\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande comme suit:\nIn answer to the said Petition, I, the Honorable James McDonald, Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada, on behalf of Her Majesty, say as follows:\n1. The admissions herein contained are made for the purposes of this matter only.\n2. I admit that the suppliant acted as one of the Counsel for the Crown before the Fishery Commission referred to in the said petition of right, but I have no knowledge of the alleged retainer or of the terms thereof and I deny the same and put the suppliant to such proof thereof as he may be advised to make.\n3. I deny that the suppliant was for more than two years employed in preparing and supporting the claim of Her Majesty as alleged in said petition, and that the expenses incurred by him in the performance of the duties of his said office, exceeded eight thousand dollars as alleged; and I submit that the expenses incurred by the suppliant in connection with his family and the loss alleged in connection with his professional affairs and family and domestic arrangements, form no part of any claim which can be enforced against Her Majesty in the premises by Petition of Right.\n4. I am informed and therefore allege that the arrangement made with the suppliant referred to in his petition under which he was to be paid one thousand dollars a month while in Halifax, was not a temporary and provisional arrangement as alleged, but that the said one thousand dollars per month, was with other moneys previously paid to the suppliant, to be accepted by him in full for his services and expenses; I am informed and therefore allege that the sum of eight thousand dollars paid to the suppliant as mentioned in his petition included the moneys payable under such arrangement, and I submit therefore that the suppliant has no further claim against the Crown in the matter. Even if it should be held that no final arrangement as to the amount to be paid the suppliant was come to, I submit that the suppliant cannot recover more than the said sum of eight thousand dollars for his expenses and for the services rendered.\n5. I deny that the Dominion Government have recognized the suppliant's right to be paid his said claim.\n6. I say that the suppliant was, when acting in connection with the matter referred to in his petition, one of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law, and that the services rendered by him in the said matter, were rendered as such Counsel. The eight thousand dollars paid him, more than covered any expenses to which he was properly put, on behalf of Her Majesty. I submit that the suppliant as such Counsel cannot enforce a claim for Counsel fees, and that no action lies for the recovery thereof, and I claim the same benefit from this objection, as if I had demurred to the said petition.\nI pray that the suppliant's petition may be dismissed with costs.\nLe p\u00e9titionnaire a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce plaidoyer comme suit:\n1. The Suppliant joins issue on paragraphs Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Defendant's statement of Defence. 2. And as to paragraph 6 of said statement of defence, Suppliant saith that he is an advocate of the Province of Quebec, and as such, was retained by the Crown as set forth in his petition; that the letter of the Department of Justice retaining him, and the amount of his retainer were received by him at Montreal, in the province of Quebec, from whence he wrote his reply agreeing to act for the Crown as requested; that as such advocate of the Province of Quebec, he is by the law of that Province entitled to claim and recover from the Crown the amount claimed by him as such advocate, under the facts set forth in his petition; and he further saith that the sum of eight thousand dollars paid him did not more than cover the expenses that he was properly put to in the premises in behalf of Her Majesty; and he claims the same benefit from this replication as if he had demurred to the said sixth paragraph of statement of defence.\nVoyons maintenant quelle est la preuve au dossier sur les issues ainsi jointes.\nD'abord, tant qu'au fait que le Ministre de la Justice a retenu les services de M. Doutre comme un des avocats et conseils pour Sa Majest\u00e9 devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries, la lettre m\u00eame du Ministre de la Justice sur le sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite. Cette lettre est en termes des moins \u00e9quivoques et le p\u00e9titionnaire ne pouvait faire une meilleure preuve. Mais cette preuve lui \u00e9tait-elle n\u00e9cessaire? Il a agi aussi ouvertement et publiquement que possible dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses devoirs comme tel avocat pour Sa Majest\u00e9: le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame lui a pay\u00e9 $8,000 sur ses d\u00e9penses, et cependant, le Procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral vient plaider ici qu'il ne sait pas et nie m\u00eame que M. Doutre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu tel qu'il l'all\u00e8gue comme avocat pour Sa Majest\u00e9!!! N'a-t-on pas lieu de s'\u00e9tonner d'un tel plaidoyer de la part du Procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral? Tant qu'au troisi\u00e8me plaidoyer, de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9, il n'est qu'une admission que le p\u00e9titionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 au moins deux ans dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ces devoirs, et que ses d\u00e9penses se montent \u00e0 au moins $8,000. Que la Couronne puisse pr\u00e9tendre que les $8,000 qu'elle a pay\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Doutre la lib\u00e8re compl\u00e8tement vis-\u00e0-vis de lui cela se comprend mais qu'apr\u00e8s lui avoir pay\u00e9 ces $8,000 comme son avocat devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries, elle vienne devant une Cour de Justice nier que M. Doutre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 son avocat devant cette Commission, d\u00e9montre bien que ceux que la Couronne charge de d\u00e9fendre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats devant les tribunaux oublient quelquefois la dignit\u00e9 et le caract\u00e8re de leur client.\nTant qu'\u00e0 la partie niant que Sa Majest\u00e9 soit oblig\u00e9e de payer les d\u00e9penses encourues par le p\u00e9titionnaire pour sa famille \u00e0 Halifax durant la Commission, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, telle qu'elle me semble \u00eatre au dossier, cette partie de la cause est sans importance.\nTant qu'au 4me plaidoyer de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9, allant \u00e0 all\u00e9guer que les $8,000 d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Doutre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par lui comme paiement entier de ses services et d\u00e9penses, la preuve sur cette partie de la cause est contradictoire. D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Sir A. Smith, alors Ministre des P\u00eacheries, il en serait ainsi, et l'arrangement qu'il aurait fait, pour Sa Majest\u00e9 avec M. Doutre est que les $8,000 seraient accept\u00e9s par lui comme r\u00e9glant enti\u00e8rement sa r\u00e9clamation tant pour ses d\u00e9penses que pour ses honoraires. Mais M. Whitcher, le Commissaire des P\u00eacheries pour la Puissance, et le paie-ma\u00eetre de la Commission \u00e0 Halifax, jure positivement que l'arrangement fait entre M. Doutre et le Ministre des P\u00eacheries n'\u00e9tait que provisoire, et qu'un arrangement final au sujet du paiement des services de M. Doutre ne devait avoir lieu qu'\u00e0 la conclusion des travaux de la Commission. M. Whitcher prit un m\u00e9moire par \u00e9crit de la conversation entre le ministre et M. Doutre et dans ce m\u00e9moire, il se sert du mot \"gratuity on the conclusion of the business\" Mais il explique qu'en prenant cette note, il ne s'est pas servi des mots m\u00eames du ministre et de M. Doutre, mais qu'il n'a fait que noter la substance de leur convention. Il jure positivement que: It ended [l'entrevue de M. Doutre avec le ministre] in an understanding that this would be a temporary arrangement so for as it was not specified, that is to say, there was to be $1,000 paid for retainer, $1,000 for refresher and $1,000 per month while the Commission sat. Further remuneration to these amounts was to form the subject of after consideration.\nUne note de M. Whitcher \u00e0 M. Weatherbe, un des avocats retenus avec M. Doutre, dit:\nMy recollection is clear that Doutre's letter for self and confr\u00e8res stipulated that the agreement about retainer, refresher and personal expenses was provisional and that settlement for professional services was deferred till the result of the Commission. This was acquiesced in by Sir A. Smith and Mr. Hind.\nComme je l'ai dit, Sir A. Smith contredit ce t\u00e9moignage et jure que le paiement des $1,000 par mois ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 celui des $2,000 fait ant\u00e9rieurement devait \u00eatre en satisfaction pleine et enti\u00e8re des services de M. Doutre.\nLe juge en cour inf\u00e9rieure a adopt\u00e9 la version de M, Whitcher, et je suis d'avis qu'il ne pouvait gu\u00e8re faire autrement.\nEt Sir A. Smith et M. Whitcher sont certainement deux t\u00e9moins des plus respectables, mais il fallait ici accepter le t\u00e9moignage de l'un et exclure celui de l'autre, il fallait choisir. Le juge a quo a cru que celui de M. Whitcher devait pr\u00e9valoir, vu que lui seul avait pris note par \u00e9crit de la convention des parties, tandis que M. Smith ne se fiait qu'\u00e0 sa m\u00e9moire qui pouvait lui faire d\u00e9faut. J'ajouterai que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Whitcher est enti\u00e8rement corrobor\u00e9 par les lettres de M. Doutre aux autres avocats dans la cause, \u00e9crites lorsqu'il s'agissait de fixer avec le gouvernement leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration commune pour leurs services sur la Commission des P\u00eacheries Celle \u00e0 M. Thomson est prouv\u00e9e par lui-m\u00eame entendu comme t\u00e9moin. Il est de r\u00e8gle certainement qu'une partie ne peut se faire une preuve par les lettres, qu'elle peut \u00e9crire, mais ici, c'est comme faisant partie du res gest\u00e6 que Ton pourrait peut-\u00eatre prendre ces lettres de M. Doutre en consid\u00e9ration.\nD'ailleurs, avec la preuve qui existe au dossier, la cour inf\u00e9rieure aurait eu le droit de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer le serment suppl\u00e9toire \u00e0 M. Doutre[60], et si la cour inf\u00e9rieure avait ce droit, cette Cour, si\u00e9geant en appel d'une cause r\u00e9gie par la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec l'a aussi. Ferrier v. Dillon[61], Daley v. Ch\u00e9vrier[62].\nOr, comme le t\u00e9moignage de M. Doutre se trouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 au dossier, quelle objection peut-il avoir \u00e0 le lire comme donn\u00e9 sous serment suppl\u00e9toire sur cette partie de la cause. Si la cour en voyait, il n'y aura qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9f\u00e9rer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le serment suppl\u00e9toire \u00e0 M. Doutre, et apr\u00e8s avoir eu ses r\u00e9ponses, \u00e0 donner le jugement final dans la cause. Le r\u00e9sultat sera bien le m\u00eame. Et prenant pour certain que M. Doutre ne jurera pas autrement qu'il l'a fait, la cause me semble tranch\u00e9e, et la preuve me semble parfaite du fait que les $8,000 pay\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient qu'un paiement provisoire, et que le r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif ne devait avoir lieu qu'\u00e0 la conclusion de la Commission. Il ne faut pas perdre de vue que si cette cause, qui, il est admis, a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise comme un test case pour d\u00e9finir les droits non-seulement de M. Doutre, mais aussi de tous les autres avocats qui ont agi conjointement avec lui pour la Couronne devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e au nom d'aucun autre des dits avocats, M. Doutre e\u00fbt alors comme t\u00e9moin ordinaire prouv\u00e9 que l'arrangement fait avec le gouvernement n'\u00e9tait que provisoire.\nTant qu'\u00e0 la preuve faite du quantum meruit, elle est des plus parfaites dans une cause de ce genre, o\u00f9 cette preuve est toujours difficile. Je n'ai rien \u00e0 ajouter l\u00e0-dessus aux remarques du savant Juge a quo, qui a analys\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages et d\u00e9montr\u00e9 clairement que la somme de $8,000 qu'il a accodd\u00e9e au p\u00e9titionnaire lui est bien et justement due parle gouvernement. De fait, au lieu de $50 c'est $100 par jour que j'aurais accord\u00e9 au p\u00e9titionnaire Si l'on consid\u00e8re la gravit\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats que M. Doutre \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter devant la Commission des P\u00eacheries l'importance et la nouveaut\u00e9 des questions qu'il a eu \u00e0 v traiter: si l'on consid\u00e8re que des millions \u00e9taient demand\u00e9s et des millions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus pour le gouvennement: si l'on consid\u00e8re la preuve faite par M. Whitcher et M. Walker du travail pr\u00e9paratoire qu'a d\u00fb s'imposer et que s'est impos\u00e9 M. Doutre pour l'ex\u00e9cution des devoirs de la charge importante que le gouvernement lui avait confi\u00e9e: si l'on prend en consid\u00e9ration, que pour remplir ses fonctions, il a d\u00fb passer six mois \u00e0 Halifax, et laisser compl\u00e8tement son bureau et sa client\u00e8le, que la preuve \u00e9tablit \u00eatre une des plus consid\u00e9rables de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, l'on est surpris que sa Majest\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de le forcer \u00e0 recourir aux tribunaux de justice pour obtenir le paiement de la somme qu'il demande pour ses services.\n[TRANSLATED.]\nTASCHEREAU, J:\u2014\nI also have arrived at the conclusion with my learned colleague Henry, that this appeal should be dismissed, but for reasons somewhat different from his.\nIn the first place, I am of opinion that this petition should be decided according to the law of the Province of Qucbec, becauee it was at Montrell that the respondent received the letter of the Minister of Justice requesting his services, and that it was at Montreal the respondent consented to be retained and agreed to give his services as one of the Canadian counsel before the Fishery Commission; and also and more particularly, because I consider that when a member of the bar of the Province of Quebec agrees and undertakes to give his services as an advocate, he does, and he can only do so, as an advocate of the Province of Quebec, and as a member of the bar of the Province of Quebec; and that in all the services he performs as such advocate, in whatever place he acts, whether before the Privy Council or elsewhere, and whether he was retained in one place rather than another, it is always as an advocate and a member of the bar of the Province of Quebec that he is acting, and as such he is entitled to all their rights and privileges. In fact he has no other right to act. He can, no doubt, exercise his profession in certain cases outside of his province, but it is always in the capacity of a barrister of his province that he acts. The fact of a person retaining a counsel to give his services outside of his province creates the ordinary relationship which exists between client and counsel in that province to which the counsel belongs.\nFor example, suppose that while Mr. Doutre is in Ottawa, he is retained by a client to go and argue a case before the Privy Council, it will not be the law of Ontario, although the contract was made in Ontario, or the law of England, where the services are to be rendered, that will regulate the rights of the parties, but rather the law of the Province of Quebec, because the client has retained and engaged him as advocate, and Mr. Doutre is an advocate of the Province of Quebec, and, I repeat it, he has no other right or title to act, except as such.\nHer Majesty has, however, admitted, although at first denied, that the cause of action has arisen in the Province of Quebec. At page 3 of the appellant's factum I find the following passage:\nIt is submitted that a new trial should be ordered on the ground of the reception of improper evidence, viz: (1.) The suppliants own evidence, the cause of action having arisen in the Province of Quebec and the suppliant's evidence, therefore, not being admissible.\nIt being admitted that this case should be decided according to the law of that Province, the question whether Mr. Doutre has a right of action to recover his fees as one of Her Majesty's counsel before the Fishery Commission is found to be solved. Under that law this question does not admit of doubt. See Amyot v. Gugy[63] and authorities there cited. Devlin v. Tumblety[64], Beaudry v. Ouimet[65], Grimard v. Burroughs[66], Vandal v. Gautier[67], and Larue v. Loranger[68], where the claim for fees was not maintained by the Court of Appeal, but it was because there was a tariff regulating those fees and no special agreement to pay any extra remuneration had been proven by the plaintiffs. The decision in the case of Grimard v. Burroughs[69] was in the same sense. See also Cour de Cassation arr\u00eats du 16 decembre, 1818 vo. Depens[70].\nIn the case of Devlin v. The Corporation of the City of Montreal the Court of Appeal on the 13th March, 1878, granted to Mr. Devlin $2,500 for his fees as the corporation lawyer on the Mount Royal Park expropriations, after weighing the evidence given in the case of the value of his services, there being no tariff regulating fees for such services, and thereby affirming the principle upon which the judgment of Mr. Justice Johnson in the court below had been given (30th May 1877), although reducing the amount.\nThe considerants of the judgment of the Superior Court on that portion of this claim which related to his fees as counsel on the expropriations of the park, are as follows:\nConsidering also that from the professional and other evidence adduced by plaintiffs, it was proved that the said mentioned services were worth the sum of ten thousand dollars; and further, that in the judgment of this court, after duly weighing such evidence, the said plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant for such last-mentioned services four thousand dollars.\nThe Court of Appeal gave as one of its considerants:\nConsidering also, that in the judgment of this court, after duly weighing such evidence, the said respondent (Devlin) is entitled to receive from the appellants (The Corporation of Montreal) for such last-mentioned services (on Mount Royal Park expropriations) two thousand five hundred dollars.\nThis is certainly an affirmance by both courts of the principle that an advocate can recover the value of his services on a quantum meruit when his services are given out of court, or their value not fixed by the tariff.\nGrimard v. Burroughs and Larue v. Loranger were relied on by Her Majesty's counsel as contrary to the respondent's pretension. But on reference to these cases, it will be found that all that has been decided is that when there is a tariff of fees and there has been no contract on the part of the client to pay more than what the tariff allows, the advocate or counsel cannot claim more than what is allowed in the tariff. It is quite evident that those cases have no application to the present case, for there was no tariff of fees in force for the counsel who were engaged before the Fishery Commission. See also the following articles of the code: Arts. 1722 and 1732, and Art. 2260, which enacts that an action for fees is prescribed by five years. Before five years the action will lie. See also Troplong vo. Mandat[71], 27 Laurent[72], 6 Boiteux[73], and the Report of the Codifiers[74]. The law is the same in Jersey Island and in the State of Louisiana, the laws in force there being in great part derived from the French law, or are similar. See the argument of Sir Roundell Palmer, now Lord Selborne, in the case of The Jersey Bar[75]. In Louisiana see Hunt v. The Orleans Cotton Press Co.[76], Re Succession of Macarty[77], Brewer v. Cook[78], Edelin v. Richardson[79], Re Succession of Lee[80].\nI should not have thought it necessary to dwell at length on a proposition which I believe is no longer denied or even doubted in the Province of Quebec, if the learned counsel representing Her Majesty had not urged the contrary.\nI will now refer to the evidence given in the case, and will state at once that, according to the laws of the Province of Quebec, Mr. Doutre could not be heard as a witness on his own behalf, and that the evidence of Mr. Doutre, which is of record as evidence on his own behalf, cannot be taken into consideration in determining this case. Sec. 63 of the Act 38 Vic. c. 11, which establishes the Exchequer Court of Canada, expressly enacts:\u2014\"Issues of fact, in cases before the said court, shall be tried according to the laws of the Province in which the cause originated, including the laws of evidence.\" And sec. 13 of 39 Vic., c. 27, makes this clause applicable to petitions of Right.\nBefore considering the evidence which is of record in this case, it is necessary to determine what are \"the matters in issue\" between the parties as appears by the record.\nIn the first place, what does the suppliant claim in his petition? It is simply a claim based on a quantum meruit for professional services rendered for Her Majesty and at her request by the suppliant before the Fishery Commissioner, together with an allegation claiming the expenses incurred by the suppliant in the execution of his duties as advocate, and stating that these expenses amounted to more than $8,000, and an averment that the suppliant was engaged for over two years in performing his duties. The suppliant also states that he has received a sum of $8,000 on account of his services, and for which sum he credits Her Majesty. He alleges also that by a provisional agreement, made with the Department of Marine and Fisheries, it was agreed, before his departure for Halifax, where the commission sat, that the Government would pay $1,000 per month during his stay in Halifax for his current expenses, leaving the amount to be paid for his fees and expenses to be determined after final settlement of the matters before the commission. These are in substance the material allegations of this petition.\nIn answer to the petition the Attorney-General, on behalf of Her Majesty, pleaded as follows:\n[His Lordship read the statement in defence[81]].\nThe suppliant replied as follows:\n[His Lordship read the replication[82]]\nNow let us examine the proof adduced in support of the issues joined.\nIn the first place, as to the fact, whether the Minister of Justice retained the services of Mr. Doutre to be one of the advocates and counsel of Her Majesty before the Fishery Commission, the letter of the Minister of Justice on the subject was fyled, and no better proof could be given by the suppliant in support of this allegation, But was it necessary for him to prove this fact? He acted publicly and openly in his said capacity of advocate of Her Majesty. The government has paid him $8,000 towards his expenses, and we find the Attorney-General, in his statement of defence, stating that he does not know, and denying, that Mr. Doutre was retained, as he alleges, as one of Her Majesty's advocates!! Have we not reason to be surprised at finding such a plea on behalf of the Attorney-General?\nAs to the third plea, it is simply an admission that the suppliant was engaged for at least two years in the performance of his duties, and that his expenses were not less than $8,000.\nThat the Crown should allege that the payment of $8,000 to Mr. Doutre was in full of all claims by Mr. Doutre, I can quite understand, but after having paid him $8,000 for such services, that the Crown should, in a court of justice, plead that Mr. Doutre was not retained as an advocate by Her Majesty before the Fishery Commission, shows clearly that those whom the Crown entrusts with the duty of defending its interests before the courts sometimes forget the dignity and character of their client To that portion of the statement of defence which alleges that Her Majesty was not bound to pay the expenses of Mr. Doutre and of his family while the commission sat at Halifax, I may state that I do not attach much importance, and the reason I do not, is on account of the nature of the evidence, which is to be found in the record on this point.\nThe fourth plea alleges that the $8,000 paid to Mr. Doutre were accepted by him as a payment in full for his services and expenses. The evidence on this part of the case is contradictory. According to Sir A. Smith, then Minister of Marine and Fisheries, it would seem that such was the case, and that the arrangement made by him on behalf of Her Majesty was that the $8,000 should be accepted by Mr. Doutre as settling in full his claim for his fees as well as for his expenses. Mr. Whitcher, however, the Commissioner of Fisheries for the Dominion, and paymaster of the commission sitting at Halifax, swears positively that the arrangement made between Mr. Doutre and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries was provisional, and that a final settlement as to the amount to which Mr. Doutre would be entitled for his services would be determined only after the conclusion of the business. Mr. Whitcher took down in writing a memorandum of the conversation between Mr. Doutre and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, and in that memorandum he made use of the following words, \"a gratuity on the conclusion of the business.\" But he goes on to explain that when taking down the memorandum he did not take down verbatim what was said between the Minister and Mr. Doutre, but he merely put down the substance of their conversation. He swears positively \"That it ended\" (that is to say, the conversation between Mr. Doutre and the Minister) \"on the understanding that it would be a temporary arrangement; so far it was not specified, that is to say there was to be $1,000 paid for retainer, $1,000 for refresher, and $1,000 per month while the commission sat. Further remuneration to these amounts was to form the subject of after consideration.\"\nIn a note addressed by Mr. Whitcher to Mr. Weatherbe, one of the counsel retained with Mr. Doutre, the former states:\nMy recollection is clear that Doutre's letter for self and confr\u00e8res stipulated that the agreement about retainer, refresher and personal expenses was provisional, and that settlement for professional services was deferred till the result of the commission. This was acquiesced in by Sir A. Smith and Mr. Ford.\nThe judge sitting in the Exchequer Court has adopted Mr. Whitcher's version of the arrangement, and I am of opinion that he could not well have arrived at another conclusion. No doubt both Sir A. Smith and Mr. Whitcher are witnesses of the highest respectability, but it was necessary to adopt one version and to exclude the other\u2014a choice had to be made. The judge a quo has thought that Mr. Whitcher's version should prevail, as he had noted in writing at the time the conversation of the parties, whilst Sir A. Smith relied entirely upon his memory, which may have failed him. I may add that Mr. Whitcher's testimony is corroborated by letters written to the other counsel engaged in the case by Mr. Doutre at the very time he was making an arrangement for them all with the Government for their services before the Fishery Commission. True, the letter to Mr. Thomson is proved by himself, heard as a witness, and it is a well-known rule that a party cannot make evidence for himself by letters which he has written, but here this letter can be taken into consideration as forming part of the res gest\u00e6.\nMoreover, with the evidence which is of record, it would have been quite competent for the court below to have examined Mr. Doutre under oath[83], and if the court below had that power this court, sitting as a Court of Appeal in a cause to be determined according to the laws of the Province of Quebec, has the same power[84].\nNow, as we find Mr. Doutre's testimony of record in the case, what objection could there be to read it as if given under the oath put by the court officially? If the court were of opinion that it could not look at the evidence, then all that need be done would be to examine Mr. Doutre under such oath, and, after having taken down his answers, to render judgment. The result would be the same. But being positive that Mr. Doutre would not swear to anything else than what he had already sworn to, there is complete proof to my mind that the sum of $8,000 paid was simply a provisional payment, and that the final settlement should take place after the closing of the business, and this virtually settles the case. It must also be borne in mind that if this petition (which has been admitted to be a test case in order to determine the rights, not only of Mr. Doutre, but also of the other counsel employed by the crown before the Fishery Commission) had been fyled by any of the other counsel, then Mr. Doutre's evidence would have been admissible, and he would have proved that this arrangement with the Minister of Marine and Fisheries was a provisional arrangement.\nAs to the evidence on the quantum meruit, it is as complete as it was possible to make it in a case of this kind, and it is always difficult to make proof of a quantum meruit. On this point I can add nothing to what has been said by the learned judge of the court below, who has analyzed the evidence, and has clearly established that the amount of $8,000 which he awarded to the suppliant was well and justly due him by the Government. I would have granted the suppliant $100 per day instead of $50. If we take into consideration the important interests which Mr. Doutre was representing before the Fishery Commission, the important and new points which he had to master and deal with; and we must not lose sight of the fact that millions of dollars were claimed and millions were awarded; and if we remember the amount of preparatory work which Mr. Whitcher and Mr. Walker have proved Mr. Doutre had to perform in order to fulfil satisfactorily the important services which he had been asked by the Government to render, and if we take into consideration that he was obliged to pass six months at Halifax, and to be away from his office and his clients\u2014and there is evidence that his practice was one of the largest in Montreal\u2014I must admit that I am surprised to find that Her Majesty has obliged Mr, Doutre to have recourse to a court of justice to get paid the amount which he claims for his services. GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIf the contract upon which the suppliant is sueing had been a contract entered into by him with the Minister, who did enter into the contract sued upon, for professional services to be rendered to himself personally, within the Province of Quebec, by the suppliant in his character of an advocate practising at the bar of that province, it may be admitted, that by the law of the Province of Quebec, the suppliant could have sued his client upon such contract in the courts of that province. McDougall v. Campbell[85] is an authority in support of the proposition that in the courts of the Province of Ontario also an action will lie at the suit of a barrister against his client for professional services rendered by the former to the latter, under a contract in that behalf; the authority of that judgment is, in some degree, weakened by the dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice of the court. Whether there is any difference between the law of Nova Scotia and that of Ontario upon the subject, and whether the same considerations which influenced the majority of the court in McDougall v. Campbell would prevail in the courts of Nova Scotia, upon the same question arising there, and that case being brought to the notice of the courts, may be open to doubt.\nAs to the contract with which we have to deal, it must, I think, be held to have been entered into in the Province of Ontario for professional services to be rendered in the Province of Nova Scotia, in a court of justice established under the authority of the Treaty of Washington for adjudicating upon a litigious matter of a national character, in controversy between the two nations of Great Britain and the United Slates of America. The contract, therefore, in my opinion, cannot be affected by the law of the Province of Quebec, or by the circumstance that the suppliant is an advocate practising at the bar of that province, and as such could maintain in the courts of that province a suit against a private client to recover remuneration for his services, and in the view which I take, it is not necessary for us to decide whether the case of McDougall v. Campbell was well or ill-decided, for this case cannot be governed, as it appears to me, by the law as affecting private contracts between a client and his counsel or advocate, whether that law be the law as it prevails in the Province of Quebec, or in Nova Scotia, or in Ontario.\nAs to the terms of the contract, we must, I think, adopt the evidence of Mr. Whitcher, and hold it to have been to the effect that, in addition to the retainer, then already paid, the suppliant should receive a further sum of $1,000, which was called a refresher, and also $1,000 more per month, during the session of the commission at Halifax, and, on the conclusion of the business, all expenses of travel and subsistence, and a liberal gratuity. Whether the term \"liberal gratuity,\" as here used, should be received in the strict sense of the word \"gratuity,\" is a question which, in view of the circumstances under which Mr. Whitcher says it was promised, namely, as a something to be given to the suppliant for services to be rendered after they should be rendered, when their value could be better estimated, seems to me to be open to doubt. Certainly if, as I understand Mr. Whitcher, the suppliant was led to regard it as a something, which, although undefined in amount, was to have in it the element of liberality, which he was induced by the promise to expect to receive as a return or recompense for his services, it could not properly be called a gratuity, which involves the idea of the absence of any equivalent or consideration being given for it; but this is a question also, which, in the view I take, it is unnecessary to decide. The suppliant's remedy against the Crown is prescribed by the Petition of Right Act, 38 Vic. c. 12. That act constitutes the suppliants sole locus standi. His right to the benefit of this remedy against the Crown must be governed wholly by the provisions of that act, and if it does not give to the suppliant the remedy of which he is seeking to avail himself, he cannot prevail as against the Crown, notwithstanding that he might maintain an action against a private client upon a similar contract. The object of that act, as its title indicates, is \"to provide for the institution of suits\" against the Crown by petition of right, and it enacts in its 8th sec. that \"nothing in this act shall be construed to give to the subject any remedy against the Crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England, under similar circumstances by the law in force there prior,\" &c.\nIt was argued, that the proper construction of this clause was merely that the 38 Vic., c. 12 did not give the remedy asserted in the present case, and it was contended that it was not necessary that it should, for that the remedy was given by the 58th sec. of the Exchequer Court Act, which was passed upon the same day, viz., 38 Vic. c. 11, but a reference to this 58th sec shows this contention not to be well founded, for it merely enacts that the court, besides certain concurrent original jurisdiction given to it, not comprehending the present case, \"shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand shall be made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might in England be the subject of a suit or action in the Court of Exchequer on its revenue side against the Crown.\" Now, relief under this section is also limited to cases in which relief might be sought against the Crown in the Court of Exchequer in England on its revenue side, so that, whichever statute we refer to, we must conform to the law prevailing in England, and as it would be administered there, in a similar case; nor does the amendment of the 58th sec. of 38 Vic. c. 11, which is effected by 39 Vic. c. 36, sec. 18, make any difference, for the amendment only gives to the Exchequer Court additional jurisdiction in all cases in which demand shall be made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might in England be the subject of a suit or action in the Court of Exchequer on its plea side against any officer of the Crown. Now it is clear beyond all doubt, that in England no counsel could maintain an action against a client to recover any sum of money promised to be paid by the client to such counsel for his advocacy, whether the promise should be made before or during or after litigation. The case of Kennedy v. Broun[86] is sufficient authority for this proposition. It is clear, therefore, that no counsel in England could, in like circumstances, have any remedy against the Crown by Petition of Right.\nBut it is contended that the expression in the above 8th sec. of 38 Vic., c. 12, \"under similar circumstances by the laws in force there,\" that is, in England, makes it necessary to import into the consideration of the case the fact that the suppliant is an advocate of the bar of the Province of Quebec, and that, in that province, he could maintain an action at law against a private client, and that, assuming the law of Ontario to prevail as the province in which the contract was entered into, he could, upon the authority of McDougall v. Campbell, also maintain an action in the courts of Ontario upon a like contract against a private client. It is contended, therefore, that the question arising upon the application of the 8th sec of 38 Vic. c. 12, is not whether a counsel in England, upon such a contract made in England as was made here with the Dominion Government, could have a remedy by petition of right against the Crown, but whether the suppliant, assuming him to be entitled to maintain an action at law in the courts of the provinces, against a private client for professional services rendered to such client, is not therefore entitled to this remedy by petition of right against the Crown. In this manner only, as is contended, can effect be given to the words \"under similar circumstances,\" &c., &c., in the Dominion Act.\nViewing that contention in the most favorable light possible for the suppliant, the question raised by it in substance amounts to this: if the contract which was entered into by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries with the suppliant had been entered into with him by a person duly authorized to act for and to represent the Imperial Government, and if the Imperial and not the Dominion Government had been the superior with whom through such agent the contract now relied upon by the suppliant was made, could the suppliant in such case proceed by petition of right in England against Her Majesty? And, to my mind, it appears to be clear that he could not. He would, in such case, be in no better position than an English counsel entering into a like agreement for his professional services. Whether the suppliant could, or could not, maintain an action at law in the provincial courts against a private client for professional services, would not enter into the consideration of the case. The question whether he could proceed by petition of right in England must be regulated solely and exclusively by the law of England, which does not give to the subject such remedy in such a case, and the effect of the 8th section of the Dominion Act, in my opinion, is, that the subject shall have no remedy by petition of right against the crown in the Dominion of Canada, if he would not have been entitled to the like remedy in England in similar circumstances by the law as in force there. The effect of the statute, as it appears to me, is, that (whatever may be the difference between the law of England and the laws of the respective provinces of the Dominion, as to the right of a counsel to maintain an action against a private client for professional services,) as affects the public represented by the crown, the law of England and that of the Dominion of Canada is the same, and it excludes a counsel in the case of a contract with the crown for his advocacy from all remedy by petition of right, to enforce such contract, thus placing all subjects of the crown in the like position under similar circumstances.\nThe appeal, therefore, in my opinion, should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nAttorney for respondent: R.

J.; and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of Right\u2014Fisheries Act, 31 Vic. ch. 60 (D)\u2014British North America Act, 1867, secs. 91, 92 and 109\u2014Fisheries, regulation and protection of\u2014License to fish in that part of the Miramichi River above Price's Bend\u2014Rights of riparian proprietors in granted and ungranted lands\u2014Right of passage and right of fishing.\nOn January 1st, 1874, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of Canada, purporting to act under the powers conferred upon him by sec. 2, ch. 60, 31 Vic., executed on behalf of Her Majesty to the suppliant an instrument called a lease of fishery, whereby Her Majesty purported to lease to the suppliant for nine years a certain portion of the South West Miramichi River in New Brunswick for the purpose of fly-fishing for salmon therein. The locus in quo being thus described in the special case agreed to by the parties:\u2014\n\"Price's Bend is about 40 or 45 miles above the ebb and flow of the tide. The stream for the greater part from this point upward, is navigable for canoes, small boats, flat bottomed scows, logs and timber. Logs are usually driven down the river in high water in the spring and fall. The stream is rapid. During summer it is in some places on the bars very shallow.\"\nCertain persons who had received conveyances of a portion of the river and who, under such conveyances, claimed the exclusive right of fishing in such portion, interrupted the suppliant in the enjoyment of his fishing under the lease granted to him, and put him to certain expenses in endeavoring to assert and defend his claim to the ownership of the fishing of that portion of the river included in his lease. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick having decided adversely to his exclusive right to fish in virtue of said lease, the suppliant presented a petition of right and claimed compensation from Her Majesty for the loss of his fishing privileges and for the expenses he had incurred.\nBy special case certain questions (which are given below) were submitted for the decision of the court, and the Exchequer Court held inter alia that an exclusive right of fishing existed in the parties who had received the conveyances, and that the Minister of Marine and Fisheries consequently had no power to grant a lease or license under sec. 2 of the Fisheries Act of the portion of the river in question, and in answer to the 8th question, viz.: \"where the lands (above tidal water) through which the said river passes are ungranted by the Crown, could the Minister of Marine and Fisheries lawfully issue a lease of that portion of the river?\" held, that the Minister could not lawfully issue a lease of the bed of the river, but that he could lawfully issue a license to fish as a franchise apart from the ownership of the soil in that portion of the river.\nThe appellant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the main question: whether or not an exclusive right of fishing did so exist.\nHeld,\u2014(affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court) 1st, that the general power of regulating and protecting the Fisheries, under the British North America Act, 1867, sec. 91, is in the Parliament of Canada, but that the license granted by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of the locus in quo was void because said act only authorizes the granting of leases \"where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law,\" and in this case the exclusive right of fishing belonged to the owners of the land through which that portion of the Miramichi River flows.\n2nd,\u2014That altho' the public may have in a river, such as the one in question, an easement or right to float rafts or logs down and a right of passage up and down in Canada, &c., wherever the water is sufficiently high to be so used, such right is not inconsistent with an exclusive right of fishing or with the right of the owners of property opposite their respective lands ad medium filum aquce.\n3rd. That the rights of fishing in a river, such as is that part of the Miramichi from Price's Bend to its source, are an incident to the grant of the land through which such river flows, and where such grants have been made there is no authority given by the B. N. A. Act, 1867, to grant a right to fish, and the Dominion Parliament has no right to give such authority.\n4th. Per Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, Fournier and Henry, J. J.\u2014(reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court on the 8th question submitted) that the ungranted lands in the Province of New Brunswick being in the Crown for the benefit of the people of New Brunswick, the exclusive right to fish follows as an incident, and is in the Crown as trustee for the benefit of the people of the province, and therefore a license by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to fish in streams running through provincial property would be illegal.\nAppeal from a judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Gwynne in the Exchequer Court of Canada, in the matter of the petition of right of Christian A. Robertson, the above named respondent.\nThe following special case was agreed to by the parties:\n\"The Miramichi river at Price's Bend is about forty or forty-five miles above the ebb and flow of the tide. The stream for the greater part from this point, upward, is navigable for canoes, small boats, flat bottom scows, logs and timber. Logs are usually driven down the river in high water in the spring and fall. The stream is rapid. During summer it is in some places on the bars very shallow. In the salmon fishing season, say June, July and August, canoes have to be hauled over the very shallow bars by hand.\n\"On the 5th November, A. D. 1835, a grant issued to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company of 580,000 acres, which included within its limits that portion of the Miramichi river which is in question, and the said grant contained, together with the usual granting clauses, the following clause:\u2014'Excepting also out of the said tract of land, described within the said bounds, all and every lot, piece and parcel of land which have been heretofore by us or our predecessors given or granted to any person or persons whatsoever, or to any body corporate by any grant or conveyance under the Great Seal of the Province of New Brunswick, or the Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia during the period when the said hereby granted tract of land was part and parcel of our said Province of Nova Scotia, together with all privileges, &c., and also further excepting the bed and waters of the Miramichi river, and the beds and waters of all the rivers and streams which empty themselves either into the river St John or the river Nashwaak, so far up the said rivers or streams respectively as the same respectively pass through, or over any of the said heretofore previously granted tracts, pieces or parcels of land hereinbefore excepted.' (Copy of grant may be referred to.)\n\"Copies of grants, made prior to the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, of same lots within and some immediately adjoining and outside of the boundaries of the company's tract, to Steven Hovey, Peter Hayes, Thomas Hunter and James Young, and twelve other copies of letters patent are herewith and may be referred to. The other grants to the others within the company's tract are in similar form; copy of map annexed to the grant to the company is also filed herewith; and all are made part of this case.\n\"On the first day of January, A. D. 1874, the Honorable Peter Mitchell, then being the Minister of Marine and Fisheries in and for the Dominion of Canada, did, in pursuance of the powers purporting to be vested in him by the Act of the parliament of Canada, intituled \"An Act for the regulation of fishing and protection of the fisheries,\" lease to suppliant as follows:\u2014\nLEASE OF FISHERY.\n\"Dominion of Canada, to wit:\n\"Lease between Her Majesty, acting by and through the Minister of Marine and Fisheries for the Dominion of Canada, of the one part, and Christian A. Robertson, esquire, of the city of St John, New Brunswick, of the other part. \"Her Majesty hereby leases, for the purpose of fly fishing for salmon, unto the said Christian A. Robertson, hereto present and accepting for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, for and during the period hereinafter mentioned, and under the conditions herein below stipulated, a certain fishing station situated on the south-west Miramichi river, in the province of New Brunswick, and described as follows, that is to say: the fluvial or angling division of the southwest Miramichi river from Price's Bend to its source.\n\"The present lease is hereby made for and during the space and term of nine years, to be computed and reckoned from the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four until the thirty-first day of December, which will be in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and on the following conditions:\u2014\n\"1st. That the said lessee shall pay to Her Majesty, into the hands of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries for the time being, or such other person or persons duly authorized to receive the same, an annual rent of fifty dollars currency, the said rent payable annually in advance.\n\"2nd. That the said lessee shall, in the use and occupation of the fishery station and privileges hereby leased, and the working of the same, in every respect conform to all and every the provisions, enactments and requirements of the fishery laws now, or which may hereafter be in force, and comply with all rules and regulations adopted or to be passed by the Governor General in Council relative thereto.\n\"3rd. That the lessee shall neither concede nor transfer any interest in the present grant, nor sub-let to any one without first duly notifying the Department of Marine and Fisheries, and receiving the written consent of the Minister thereof, or some other person or persons authorized to that effect. Provided always that actual settlers shall enjoy the privilege of fishing with a rod and line in the manner known as fly surface-fishing in front of their own properties.\n\"4th. That the said lessee shall not have any right, claim or pretension to any indemnity or abatement of rent by reason of a decrease or failure in the fishery by these presents leased.\n\"5th. That in default of payment by the said lessee of the rent as hereinbefore stipulated, or by his neglect, default or evasion, failure or refusal to fulfil any of the other clauses and conditions of this lease, the same may, at the option of the lessor, be at any time determined and put an end to upon notice thereof to the said lessee by letter posted to him to the post office nearest to the said premises, or by personal notice through any overseer of fisheries for the province of New Brunswick, or other person by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries deputed for the purpose, and the said lease shall become absolutely void and the crown may thereupon enter into possession and enjoyment of the said station and privileges without any indemnification for improvements or recourse to law, and relet the same; the said lessee being moreover held bound and liable for all loss or damage which might accrue or arise to the crown by reason of receiving a lower rent, or being unable to release the premises and privileges appertaining thereto or otherwise.\n\"6th. That the said lessee binds himself to establish and maintain efficient private guardianship upon the said stream throughout each season, to the satisfaction of the lessor, who reserves the right of four rods.\n\"This said lease (in duplicate) made and passed on the thirty-first day of October, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three in presence of the undersigned witnesses.\nP. MITCHELL,\nMinister of Marine and Fisheries.\nWitness: S. P. Bauset.\nCountersigned\u2014W. F. Whitcher,\nCommissioner of Fisheries.\nC. A. Robertson.\nWitness: W. H. Venning.\n\"It is admitted for the purpose of this case:\n\"1. That the Government of Canada did not own the lands adjoining the said river within the limits of the said lease.\n\"2. That the said lease includes all that portion of the South-west Miramichi River included in the lands of the aforesaid grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company; and also the remainder of the river above the said grant up to its source, which last portion of the river passes through ungranted land, and is of comparatively little value for the purpose of salmon fishing. That the said river for several miles up the stream and above and below the lots and parcels of land previously granted to the said New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company, and excepted in the said grant, is within the boundaries of the land described in the said grant. That under the said lease the suppliant entered upon the said fluvial division so leased to him, and paid the annual rent, and fulfilled and performed all the conditions and agreements and provisions in the said lease contained on his part and behalf to be kept fulfilled and performed.\n\"3. That although the suppliant under the said lease claimed to be in occupation of the said fishery station described in aforesaid lease, and to have the exclusive right of fishing therein, and that subject to the reservations in the said lease he had the right of preventing all persons from fishing for salmon within the bounds of the said fishery station, James Steadman and Edgar Hanson, who were not actual settlers, and who did not have or claim to have any lease, license or permission so to do from the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, or from the suppliant, did (with the permission and consent of and under and by virtue of conveyances from the said Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company of land, including a portion of the said river above the aforesaid grants so excepted and reserved in said grant to the Company), during the year 1875, and during the season when fly fishing was lawful, enter upon the said portion of the river, being a part of the river so leased as aforesaid, and fished for and caught salmon by fly fishing against the will of suppliant and against his consent.\n\"4. That in order to maintain his rights and privileges, and the right of fishing purporting to be granted and demised to the suppliant by the said lease, the suppliant prevented the said James Steadman and Edgar Hanson from fly fishing.\n\"5. That the said James Steadman and Edgar Hanson, respectively, brought actions against the suppliant and his servants for and by reason of such prevention from fishing, as above stated, and such proceedings were thereupon had that the said James Steadman and Edgar Hanson recovered against the suppliant damages and costs, which the suppliant has been obliged to pay, and that the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on appeal (see Steadman v. Robertson et al., and Hanson v. Robertson et al.[1], held that the Minister of Marine and Fisheries had no right or power to issue the said fishery lease, and that the same was null and void.\n\"6. That in and about the defence of the said actions the suppliant also incurred costs and expenses. \"7. That also by reason of the premises the suppliant has sustained other loss and damage.\n\"8. That in establishing and maintaining efficient private guardianship upon the said stream through the season, required by the said lease, the suppliant has also expended money.\n\"9. That the suppliant therefore prays that her Majesty will be pleased to do what is right and just in the premises, and cause the suppliant to be re-imbursed and compensated for the moneys so expended by him as aforesaid, and for the losses, damages and injuries sustained by him as aforesaid.\n\"10. It is agreed that the statements above set out are admitted for the purpose of this; special case, and are to be used for the purpose of enabling the court to decide the questions of law raised hereby.\n\"11. It is also agreed that either party may appeal from the judgment to be pronounced in the above case as upon a demurrer.\n\"The following questions are therefore submitted for the decision of the court:\u2014\n\"1. Had the Parliament of Canada power to pass the 2nd section of the said Act entitled \"An Act for the regulation of fishing and the protection of the Fisheries?\"\n\"2 Had the Minister of Marine and Fisheries the right to issue the fishery lease in question?\n\"3. Was the bed of the S. W. Miramichi within the limits of grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, and above the grants mentioned and reserved therein, granted to the said company?\n\"4. If so, did the exclusive right of fishing in said river thereby pass to the said company?\n\"5. If the bed of the river did not pass, had the company, as riparian proprietor, the right of fishing ad filum aqu\u00e6; and if so, was that right exclusive? \"6. Have the grantees in grants of lots bounded by srid river, or by any part thereof, and excepted from the said company's grant, any exclusive or other right of fishing in said river opposite their respective grants?\n\"7. If an exclusive right of fishing in a portion of the Miramichi river passed to said company, or to the grantees in the excepted grants, or any of them, could the Minister of Marine and Fisheries issue a valid fishery lease of such portion of the river?\n\"8. Where the lands (above tidal water) through which the said river passes are ungranted by the Crown, could the Minister of Marine and Fisheries lawfully issue a lease of that portion of the river?\n\"9. It is understood and agreed, that if upon the final determination of the case it be held that the Government had no power to make the lease in question to Mr. Robertson, an order shall be made referring it to the proper officer of the court to take an account of the expenses actually and properly incurred by Mr. Robertson, in connection with the suits in the courts of New Brunswick, and such other actual expenses as he may have been put to on account of the action of the parties who intercepted the rights claimed by him under the lease; and it is further understood and agreed that the government shall pay to Mr. Robertson such of these expenses as the court may think him entitled to, in case the parties to this suit may differ upon the matter.\"\nThe case was argued in the Exchequer Court for the Suppliant by Mr. Haliburton, Q.C., and for the Crown by Mr. Lash, Q.C.\nOn the 7th October, 1889, the following judgment was delivered by Gwynne, J.:\u2014\n\"This special case came before me in the month of February, but upon the argument appearing to be imperfect was withdrawn, and amended, and as so amended was argued in the month of May. After this argument there appeared to me to be still wanting information as to some facts which should be introduced by way of further amendment. These facts have been supplied during the vacation and are now made part of the case.\n\"The question is as to the right to the Salmon Fishery in the Miramichi River in the Province of New Brunswick, and as to the validity of an instrument purporting to be a lease or license under the provisions of the Fisheries Act of 1868, issued by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, bearing date 31st of October 1873. The questions submitted by the special case which has been agreed upon are as follows:\n\"1st. Had the Parliament of Canada power to pass the 2nd section of the Act of 1863 entitled, 'An Act for the regulation of Fishing and the Protection of the Fisheries'?\n\"2nd. Had the Minister of Marine and Fisheries the right to issue the Fishery Lease in question?\n\"3rd. Was the bed of S. W. Miramichi River within the limits of the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, and above the grants mentioned and reserved therein, granted to the said Company?\n\"4. If so, did the exclusive right of fishing in said River thereby pass to the said Company?\n\"5. If the bed of the River did not pass, had the Company as riparian proprietor the right of fishing ad filum aqu\u00e6, and if so, was that right exclusive?\n\"6. Have the Grantees in grants of lots bounded by said River or by any part thereof, and excepted from the said Company's grant, any exclusive, or other right of fishing in said River opposite to their respective grants?\n\"7. If an exclusive right of fishing in a portion of the Miramichi River passed to the said Company or to the grantees in the excepted grants or any of them, could the Minister of Marine and Fisheries issue a valid fishery lease of such portion of the River?\n\"8. Where the lands, above tidal water, through which the said River passes are ungranted by the Crown, could the Minister of Marine and Fisheries lawfully issue a Lease of that a portion of the River?\n\"It is agreed by the case, that if, upon the final determination of it, it be held that the Government had no power to make the lease in question to the Suppliant, an order shall be made referring it to the proper officer of the Court to take an account of the expenses actually and properly incurred in connection with certain suits in the Courts in New Brunswick and such other actual expenses as he may have been put to on account of the action of parties who intercepted the rights claimed by him under the lease, and it was further agreed that the Government should pay to the Suppliant such of those expenses as the Court may think him entitled to, in case the Suppliant and the Government should differ upon the matter.\n\"The clause of the Act referred to in the first of the above questions is the 2nd section of the Dominion Act 31st Vic., ch. 60, and is as follows:\u2014'The Minister of Marine and Fisheries may, where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, issue or authorize to be issued Fishery Leases, and licenses for Fisheries and fishing, wherever situate and carried on, but leases or licenses for any term exceeding nine years, shall be issued only under authority of an order of the Governor in Council.'\n\"The Act in which this section is contained was passed by the Dominion Parliament 'for the regulation of fishing and the protection of Fisheries' and it was passed under the authority of the British North America Act, the 91st section of which places, among other matters, under the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada, 'Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries.'\n\"To secure an uniformly consistent construction of this our Constitutional Charter it is necessary that some certain and sufficient canon of construction should be laid down and adopted, by which all Acts passed as well by the Parliament as by the Local Legislatures may be effectually tested upon a question arising as to their being or not being intra vires of the legislating body passing them. Such a canon appeared to me to be that formulated by me in the City of Fredericton vs. The Queen[2], and it still appears to me to be a good and sufficient rule for the required purpose, namely,\u2014'All subjects of legislation of every description whatever are within the jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament to legislate upon, except such as are placed by the British North America Act under the exclusive control of the Local Legislatures, and nothing is placed under the exclusive control of the Local Legislatures unless it comes within some or one of the subjects specially enumerated in the 92nd section, and is at the same time outside of the several items enumerated in the 91st section, that is to say, does not involve any interference with any of those items.' The effect of the closing paragraph of the 91st section, namely: 'and any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in the 91st section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces' in my opinion clearly is to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Local Legislatures the several subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, in so far as they relate to or affect any of the matters enumerated in the 91st section. \"Now among the items enumerated in section 92 there is nothing which could give to the Local Legislatures any jurisdiction whatever over Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries, unless it be the item 'Property and Civil Rights in the Province,' but inasmuch as 'Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries' are enumerated specially in the 91st section as placed under the exclusive control of Parliament, this enumeration carries with it exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights in every province in so far as whatever is comprehended under the term 'Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries' is concerned, and the Local Legislatures have no jurisdiction whatever over this subject; the jurisdiction therefore which is given to the Local Legislatures over 'property and civil rights in the Province' is not an absolute, but only a qualified jurisdiction, and must be held to be limited to the residuum of such jurisdiction not absorbed by the exclusive control given to the Dominion Parliament over every one of the subjects enumerated in the 91st section: while the jurisdiction of Parliament over every subject placed under its control is as absolute and supreme as the jurisdiction of the Imperial Parliament over the like subject in the United Kingdom would be; the design of the British North America Act being to give to the Dominion of Canada a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. It is of course, in every case, necessary to form an accurate judgment upon what is the particular subject matter in each case as to which the question arises, for the extent of the control of parliament over the subject-matter, may possibly be limited by the nature of the subject; for example, the first item enumerated in the 91st section as placed under the exclusive control of the Parliament is 'the Public debt and property,' and by section 108 the Provincial Public Works and property are declared to be the property of Canada. The jurisdiction of Parliament over such property is in virtue of the subject-matter being the property of Canada, but if Parliament should so legislate as to dispose absolutely by sale of portions of this property from time to time, it may well be that the property so sold, when it should become the property of individuals, should be no longer subject to the control of the Dominion Parliament any more than any other property of an individual should be; but over most of the subjects enumerated in the 91st section, the right of the Dominion Parliament to legislate is wholly irrespective of there being any property in the several subjects vested in the Dominion of Canada, and over those subjects the right of legislation continues forever, no matter who may have 'property or civil rights' therein. There is nothing strange in this provision; on the contrary, it is in perfect character with the whole scheme of the Act, that the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament should be supreme over all subjects which are of general public interest to the whole Dominion in whomsoever the property in such subject may be vested.\n\"It cannot be questioned that all the inhabitants of this Dominion, in whatever Province they may reside, have an interest in the regulation and protection of the Fisheries, whether they be Sea Coast or Inland, not only as affording a large supply of food for the inhabitants of the Dominion, but a very extensive traffic also between the several Provinces and with England as well as with Foreign States, thus extending the trade and commerce external and internal of the Dominion, and this interest of the public in the Fisheries is not the less because in our Inland waters, consisting of Rivers and Lakes teeming with the finest fish, private persons may have property therein. Now, what is to be comprehended under the term 'Fisheries' as used in the 12th item of the 91st section of the British North America Act? In Abbot's Law Dictionary, the term is defined to be, \"the right to take fish at a certain place or upon particular waters.\"\n\"Chancellor Kent, in his commentaries, defines common of Piscary to be 'a liberty or right of fishing in water covering the soil of another or in a river running through another man's lands'\u2014'it is not,' he says, 'an exclusive right, but one enjoyed in common with certain other persons.' Lord Holt, in 2 Salk. 637, said that it was to be resembled to the case of other commons.\n\"In the Mayor of Carlisle v. Graham[3] 'Common of Fishery' is distinguished from 'Common Fishery,' the former being defined to be a right enjoyed by several persons, but not the whole public, in a particular stream, and the latter, a right enjoyed by all the public as on the sea, or to the ebb and flow of the tide: 'Free Fishery,' is there defined to be a franchise in the hands of a subject existing by grant or prescription distinguished from an ownership in the soil; and 'Several Fishery' to be a private exclusive right of fishing in a navigable river or arm of the sea, but whether it must be accompanied with ownership in the soil, in that the authorities differ.\n\"Mr. Hargrave in his jurisconsult consultations on the distinction of Fisheries differs from Blackstone, who was of opinion that the ownership of the soil was essential to a several fishery; after quoting Lord Coke's argument, Mr. Hargrave says: 'At the utmost, they only prove that a several Piscary is presumed to comprehend the soil until the contrary appears, which is perfectly consistent with Lord Coke's position that they may be in different persons, and this indeed appears to be the true doctrine on the subject; and Chancellor Kent in his commentaries[4] says: 'The more easy and intelligible arrangement of the subject would seem to be to divide the right of fishing into a right common to all and right vested exclusively in one or more persons.' In fresh water rivers, he says, 'that is, above the ebb and flow of the tide, the owners of the soil on each side had the interest and the right of fishery, and it was an exclusive right extending to the centre of the stream opposite their respective lands unless a special grant or prescription be shown.'\n\"In Lord Fitz Walters case[5], Hale, C.J., ruled that in the case of a private, river the Lord having the soil, is good evidence to prove he has the right of fishing, and it put the proof on them that claim liberam Piscariam, i. e. a right of fishing distinct from ownership of the soil.\n\"The right of fishing, then, in rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, may exist as a right incident upon the ownership of the soil or bed of the river, or as a right wholly distinct from such ownership, and so the ownership of the bed of a river may be in one person, and the right of fishing in the waters covering that bed may be wholly in another or others.\n\u201cNow, that the British North America Act did not contemplate placing the title or ownership of the beds of fresh water rivers under the control of the Dominion Parliament so as to enable that Parliament to affect the title to the beds of such rivers sufficiently appears, I think, from the 109th section, by which 'all lands mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunwick at the Union' are declared to belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate, and this term 'lands' in this section is sufficient to comprehend the beds of all rivers in those ungranted lands. We must, however, in order to give a consistent construction to the whole Act, read this 109th section in connection with and subject to the provisions of the 91st section, which places 'all Fisheries' both sea, coast and inland under the exclusive Legislative control of the Dominion Parliament. Full effect can be given to the whole Act by construing it (and this appears to me to be its true construction) as placing the fisheries or right of fishing in all rivers running through ungranted lands in the several Provinces, as well as in all rivers running through lands then already granted, as distinct and severed from the property in, or title to, the soil or beds of these rivers, under the exclusive Legislative control of the Dominion Parliament. So construing the term 'Fisheries,' the control of the Dominion Parliament may be, and is, exclusive and supreme without its having any jurisdiction to legislate so as to alter in any respect the title or ownership of the beds of the rivers in which the Fisheries may exist. That title may be and is in the Grantees of the Crown where the title has passed, or may pass hereafter, by grants to be made under the seal of the several Provinces in which the lands may lie, but the exclusive right to control the 'Fisheries,' as a property or right of fishing distinct from ownership of the soil, is vested in the Dominion Parliament.\n\"So construing the term, it must be held to comprehend the right to control, in such manner as to Parliament in its discretion shall seem expedient, all deep sea fishing and the right to take all fish ordinarily caught either on the sea coast or in the great lakes or in the rivers of the Dominion, and which are valuable for food, within the Dominion, or for exportation for that purpose, or for any other purpose of trade and commerce, and must include as well the right to catch fish as the designation and control of the places where the fish may be caught and the times and manner of catching; it must also, as it appears to me, be construed to comprehend all such rights of fishing and other matters relating to the 'Fisheries,' as distinct from ownership of the bed of the streams, and relating to the protection of the fish, as had been provided by legislation within any of the old Provinces, as the same were constituted before the passing of British North America Act. Now, many Acts had been passed by the legislature of the old Province of New Brunswick for the regulation and protection of the fisheries in that Province between the 33rd Geo. 3rd, ch. 9, and 26 Vic. ch. 6, prohibiting, among other things, the use of drift nets, the erection of any hedge, weir, fishgarth, or other, incumbrance, or the placing any seine or net across any river, cove or creek in the Province in such manner as to obstruct or injure the natural course of the fish in any river where they usually go\u2014regulating the construction of Mill dams\u2014prohibiting also the fishing for Salmon and other fish at certain periods of the year, and giving to the Justices in General Sessions in each County power to establish such other rules and regulations as to them should seem fit for the better production and preservation of the fish within their respective counties, provided that such regulations should not be contrary to, and should not interfere with, the general regulations and restrictions contained in any Act of Assembly or private right. By chapter 101, of the Revised Statutes, the Governor in Council was authorized to appoint two wardens of Fisheries in any County, who should watch over and protect the fisheries, enforce the provisions of that Act, the rules of the Justices in Sessions, or of municipal authorities, and the regulations of the Governor in Council in relation to such fisheries.\nSection 5 authorized the Governor in Council to grant leases or licenses of occupation, for a term not exceeding five years, for fishing stations on ungranted shores, beaches or islands, which should terminate when such stations should cease to be used for such purpose, and that such leases or licenses should be sold at public auction, but that the right in lands and privileges already granted should not be affected thereby. This provision as to leases or licenses would seem to apply only to fishing in tidal waters, but 26 Vic. ch. 6, which was in fact an amendment and consolidation of all previous Acts from ch. 101 of the Revised Statutes, enacted that the Governor in Council might grant leases or licenses for fishing purposes in rivers and streams above the tidal waters of such streams or rivers when the same belong to the Crown, or the lands are ungranted, that such leases or licenses should be sold by public auction after 30 days notice in the Royal Gazette, the upset price being determined by the Governor in Council, but that the rights of parties in lands and privileges already granted should not be affected thereby, and that the rents and profits arising from such leases or licenses should be paid into the Provincial Treasury to a separate account to be kept, called 'The Fishery protection account.'\n\"In Nova Scotia also there were statutes of a somewhat similar character. Ch. 94 of Title 25 revised Stat. (2nd series) regulated the Sea Coast Fisheries, and ch. 95 the River Fisheries. The first section of this latter Act empowered the Sessions from time to time to make orders for regulating the River Fisheries, and subjected every person who should transgress such orders to a fine not exceeding \u00a310 for each offence, and by section 6 it was enacted that the Sessions should annually appoint such and so many places on the rivers and streams as might be attended with the least inconvenience to the owners of the soil or the rivers as resorts for the purpose of taking fish, but that the same and the enactments in the Act contained should not extend to any species of fish from the sea, except Salmon, Bass, Shad, Ale wives and Gaspereaux.\n\"The 10th section regulated the Salmon fishing. So likewise in Canada an Act was passed, entituled 'An Act respecting fisheries and fishing,' Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 22 Vic., ch. 62, containing many like provisions, the first section of which authorized the Governor in Council to grant special fishing leases and licenses on lands belonging to the Crown for any term not exceeding nine years, and to make all and every such regulations as might be found necessary or expedient for the better management and regulation of the Fisheries of the Province. This Act was amended by the 29 Vic., ch. 11, the 3rd section of which (and from which the 2nd section of 31 Vic., ch. 60 would seem to be taken) purported to give the Commissioner of Crown Lands the authority which the latter Act and section purports to give to the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, and is as follows: 'The Commissioner of Crown Lands may, where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law in favor of private persons, issue fishing leases and licenses for fisheries and fishing wheresoever situated or carried on, and grant licenses of occupation for public lands in connection with fisheries, but leases or licenses for any term exceeding nine years shall be issued only under authority of the Governor General in Council.'\n\"At the time of the passing of the British North America Act, the above recited Acts were in force in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada respectively, and by force of the 129th section continued so to be, after the passing of the Act, until the same should he repealed, abolished or altered by Parliament, and the effect was in fact, the same as if the British North. America Act had for the protection and preservation of the fisheries, in precise terms, repealed those enactments and declared that the Dominion Executive should have full power to carry them into effect until the Parliament should repeal, abolish or alter those enactments or any of them, or make additional or other provisions in their stead\u2014unlimited power is thus vested in the Parliament, either to maintain the then existing provisions or such of them as it should think fit, or in its wisdom to repeal, abolish or alter those provisions and to make such further and other, or the like provisions and enactments upon the subject, as to it should seem expedient. Now the Act under consideration, viz: 31 Vic., ch. 60, maintains the like scrupulous respect for private rights as the old acts which it repealed had done; for by the 2nd section the power given to the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to issue fishery leases and licenses is confined expressly to those places 'where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law,' following the provision of the Canada Statute 29 Vic., ch. 11, section 3.\n\"In all matters placed under the control of Parliament, all private interests, whether Provincial or personal, must yield to the public interest and to the public will, in relation to the subject-matter, as expressed in an Act of Parliament. Constituted as the Dominion Parliament is after the pattern of the Imperial Parliament, and consisting as it does of Her Majesty, a Senate and a House of Commons, as separate branches, the latter elected by the people as their representatives, the rights and interests of private persons, it must be presumed, will always be duly considered, and the principles of the British Constitution, which forbids that any man should be wantonly deprived of his property under pretence of the public benefit or without due compensation, be always respected.\n\"It is, however, in Parliament, upon the occasion of the passing of any Act which may effect injuriously private rights, that those rights are to be asserted, for once an Act is passed by the Parliament in respect of any matter over which it has jurisdiction to legislate, it is not competent for this or any Court to pronounce the Act to be invalid because it may affect injuriously private rights, any more than it would be competent for the Courts in England, for the like reason, to refuse to give effect to a like Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. If the subject be within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament and the terms of the Act be explicit, so long as it remains in force effect must be given to it in all Courts of the Dominion, however private rights may be affected. There is no evil to be apprehended from giving, in our constitution, full effect to this principle, which is inherent in the British Constitution, nor would the transfer of jurisdiction to the Local Legislatures be any improvement, for experience does not warrant the belief that the interests of private persons in relation to any subject would be more respected, or the Public interest be better protected, if such subject were placed under the control of the Local Legislatures instead of under that of Parliament.\n\"The Imperial Parliament, having supreme control over the title to, or ownership of, the beds and soil of the inland waters of the Dominion, and also over the franchise or right of fishing therein as a distinct property, has, at the request of the old Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as the same were constituted before the passing of the British North America Act, so dealt with those subjects as, while leaving the title to the beds and soil of all rivers and streams passing through or by the side of lands already granted in the grantees of such respective lands, to place the franchise or right to fish as a separate property distinct from the ownership of the soil under the sole, exclusive and supreme control of the Dominion Parliament. Construing then the term 'Fisheries' as used in the British North America Act, as this franchise or incorporeal hereditament apart from and irrespective of the title to the land covered with water in which the Fisheries exist, it seems to me to be free from all doubt, that the jurisdiction of Parliament over all fisheries, whether sea, coast or inland, and whether in Lakes or Rivers, is exclusive and supreme, notwithstanding that in the rivers and other waters wherein such fisheries exist, until Parliament should legislate upon the subject, private persons may be seised and possessed of the fishing in such waters, either as a right incident to ownership of the beds and soil covered by such waters, or otherwise; and that therefore, the first question in the special case must be answered in the affirmative.\n\"The special case raises no question as to the terms of the particular instrument which has been used, nor whether it gives to the party named therein, assuming the Minister signing it to have the right to give, an exclusive franchise or privilege of fishing in the waters named during the period named; or only a right in common with others to whom a like privilege might be given as in Bloomfield vs. Johnson[6], but for the reasons already stated it will be seen that, while by force of the statute, the form of the instrument (although it is not issued under the great seal of the Dominion, under which alone such a franchise could, by the course of the Common Law, be granted) may be sufficient to pass the franchise as distinct from the ownership of the bed or soil of the river, it cannot operate as a demise or transfer of the legal estate in the bed of the river to the donee or Grantee or Licensee (which latter term seems to me to be the most appropriate) of the franchise. As to the residue of the questions submitted in the special case, it will be convenient to review the nature, condition and title to the particular property in question, namely:\u2014the right of fishing in the Miramichi River prior to and at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, and to consider what the law as affecting such property then was.\n\"The special case states that the portion of the Miramichi River which is covered by the Fishery Lease to the Suppliant is above tidal waters and is navigable for canoes and boats and has been used from the earliest settlement of the Country as a highway for the same and for the purpose of floating down timber and log to market. After the St. John, the largest river in New Brunswick is the Miramichi, flowing northward into an extensive Bay of its own name. It is 225 miles in length and seven miles wide at its mouth. It is navigable for large vessels 25 miles from the Gulf, and for schooners 20 miles further to the head of the tide, above which for sixty miles it is navigable for tow boats. It has many large tributaries spreading over a great extent of Country.\u2014Price's Bend is about 40 or 50 miles above the ebb and flow of the tide. The stream for the greater part from this point upwards is navigable for canoes, small boats, flat bottomed scows, logs and timber; logs are usually driven down the River in highwater in the Spring and Fall. The stream is rapid: during summer, it is in some places on the bars very shallow. In the salmon fishing season, say June, July and August, canoes have to be hauled over the very shallow bars by hand.\n\"On the 5th November, 1835, a Grant issued to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company of 580,000 acres, which included within its limits that portion of the Miramichi River which is in question, and the said Grant contained with the usual granting clauses the following clause, 'excepting also out of the said tract of land described within the said bounds, all and every lot, piece or parcel of land which have been heretofore by us or our predecessors given or granted to any person or persons whatsoever, or to any body corporate by any grant or conveyance under the Great Seal of the Province of New Brunswick, or the Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia, during the period when the said hereby granted tract of land was part and parcel of our said Province of Nova Scotia, together with all privileges, &c., and also further excepting the bed and waters of the Miramichi river and the beds and waters of all the rivers and streams which empty themselves into the St. John or the river Nashwaak so far up the said rivers and streams respectively as the same respectively pass through or over any of the said heretofore previously granted pieces or parcels of land hereinbefore excepted.'\n\"The contention of Mr. Lash upon the part of the Crown as representing the Dominion Government is, that the admissions in the case establish the River Miramichi, at the locus in quo, to be a navigable river, and that, as such, the public at large had a common right of fishing therein, and that therefore there could be no exclusive right of fishing therein, even if the bed of the River had passed by the Grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, a point which however he disputes, contending that the bed of the river Miramichi is wholly excepted from the grant; and if the river be, as he contends it is, a public river, he contends that Magna Charta prevents any exclusive right of fishing therein. That the St. Lawrence and other great rivers of Old Canada and the great Lakes formed by them are public waters open to the public at large, who have the right not only of navigation but of fishing also therein, unless in places which are covered by special grants, is too well established now to admit of a doubt. If the principle upon which Dixon vs. Scnetsinger[7] was decided be the correct principle, that right is established upon a firm basis in all those waters, wholly irrespective of the Common Law principle that such right is by the Common Law of England confined to tidal waters; but the same reasoning as in Dixon vs. Scnetsinger was applied to the rivers of Old Canada will not apply to the rivers of New Brunswick, the right of fishing in which must be considered with reference to the Common Law of England. I find some difficulty in determining what is precisely meant by the expression in the special case, wherein it is admitted that the portion of the Miramichi river which is covered by the fishery lease to the Suppliant, 'has been used from the earliest settlement of the country as a highway for the same and for the purpose of floating down timber and logs to market'\u2014for, by the plan which accompanies the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, it would seem that for some 20 or 30 miles up the Miramichi river, within the limits of the Company's grant and above the highest prior grant of any land upon the river above Price's Bend, the country was a dense forest without any settlement whatever, and higher up than the company's grant there is not said to have been any settlement, nor is it said that there had been any licenses to cut timber granted by the Crown in any part of the tract upon the river above the remotest land which had been granted. I find it difficult therefore to understand, if this is what is meant to be admitted, how from the earliest settlement in New Brunswick that part of the river which runs through wild ungranted forest land in which there never had been any settlement whatever, nor, so far as appears by the case stated, any licenses granted to cut timber, could have been used as stated in the case 'as a highway and for the purpose of floating down timber and logs to market.' However, the case sufficiently establishes the character of the river, for it admits that the part in question is above Price's Bend, which is situate 40 or 50 miles above the ebb and flow of the tide, and that from this point upwards the river is navigable only for canoes, small boats, flat bottom scows, logs and timber, which latter are driven down the river in high water, in the spring and fall, and that in the months of June, July and August, which is the Salmon fishing season, the water is so low that canoes have to be carried over the bars which are very shallow, and that consequently, during this period of the year, the river is not, at the part in question, navigable for flat bottomed boats, logs or timber. Lloyd vs Jones[8] is an authority that there is no connection between a right of fishing and a right of passage on a fresh water river\u2014that is, above the ebb and flow of the tide, and that the existence of the latter right does not carry with it the former. Creswell, J., at page 8 J, puts the point thus 'what answer is it to plaintiff's complaint that the defendant unlawfully fished in his stream for the latter to say that he had a right of way over the locus in quo?' So from Ewing vs. Colquhoun[9] it appears that a right of navigation in the public with boats, barges, rafts, &c., &c., on an inland river, involves no right of property in the river or its bed. The public have merely the right to use the river for passing to and fro upon it, in the same manner as they have a right of passage along a public road or foot path through a private estate, but the right of fishing in such a river by the riparian proprietors, is a right of property vested in such proprietors, in virtue of their being seized of the alveus of the stream ad medium filum aquae, which prim\u00e2 facie all proprietors of land adjoining an inland river are; but if the prim\u00e2 facie ownership is rebutted by shewing the alveus of the river to be in another, then the right of fishing in that river follows the proprietorship of the alveus, until it be shewn that a right to fish has been acquired either by grant or prescription by a person not seised of the alveus: 'Riparian proprietors' is a term applied by the civilians to the owners of water courses, and the use of the same significant and convenient term is now fully introduced into the Common Law: the soil of the bed itself and consequently the water may be, and most often is, divided between two opposite riparian owners, that is, the land on one side may be owned by one person and the land on the opposite side by another. When such is the case each proprietor owns to the middle, or, what is called the thread of the river: there is but one difference between a stream running through a man's land, and one which runs by the side of it, in the former case he owns the whole and in the latter but half[10]. And in sec. 61 of his work on waters and watercourses Angell says 'It will be seen by reference to the first chapter that where a person owns the whole of the soil over which a watercourse runs in its natural course, he alone is entitled to the use and profits of the water, and that where a person owns only the land upon one side of a water course, his interest in the soil and his right to the water extends to the middle of the stream: concomitant with this interest in the soil of the bed of watercourses is an exclusive right of fishing, so that the riparian proprietor, and he alone, is authorized to take fish from any part of the stream included within his territorial limits.' And Hale, Jure maris, p. 5 of Hargrave's tracts, says: 'Fresh water rivers of what kind soever do of common right belong to the owners of the soil adjacent, so that the owners of one side have of common right the propriety, that is, the property of the soil, and consequently the right of fishing usque ad filum aquae, and the owners of the other side the right of soil or ownership and fishing unto the filum aquae on their side: and if a man be owner of the land on both sides, in common presumption he is owner of the whole river, and hath the right of fishing according to the extent of his land in length.' When we speak then of the riparian proprietor or proprietors having the exclusive right of fishing in the river passing through or by the side of his or their lands, what is meant by the term \"riparian proprietor\" is the owner of the whole bed of the stream as well as of the land through which the stream passes, or the owners of the land on either side and of the bed of the stream, each on his own side ad medium filum aquae, which every owner of land upon either side of a stream is presumed to be until the contrary is shewn.\n\"Chancellor Kent, in his commentaries says: 'It was a settled principle of the Common Law that the owners of lands on the banks of fresh water rivers, above the ebbing and flowing of the tide, had the exclusive right of fishing, as well as the right of property opposite their respective lands, ad medium filum aquae, and where the lands on each side of the river belonged to the same person, he had the same exclusive right of fishing in the whole river, so far as his land extended along the same. The right exists in the rivers of that description, though they be of the first magnitude, and navigable for rafts or boats, but they are subjected to the jus publicum as a common highway or easement. In rivers not navigable (and in the Common Law sense of the term, they were only deemed to be navigable as far as the flux and reflux of the tide,) the owners of the soil on each side had the interest and the right of fishery, and it was an exclusive right extending to the centre of the stream opposite their respective lands. This private right of fishing is confined to fresh water rivers, that is to rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, unless a special grant or prescription be shewn, but the right of fishing in the sea and in the bays and arms of the sea and in navigable tide water rivers belongs to the general public, and any person asserting an exclusive privilege there must shew it strictly by grant or prescription.'\u2014\n\"In Murphy vs. Ryan[11] it was held that the public cannot acquire, by immemorial usage, any right of fishing in a river, in which, though it be navigable, in fact the tide does not ebb and flow, and that the term 'Navigable' used in a legal sense, as applied to a river in which the soil prim\u00e2 facie belongs to the Crown and the fishing to the public, imports that the river is one in which the tide ebbs and flows.\n\"This case is one of great authority, not only for the learning of the learned Judges who decided it, but because it is cited with approbation by the Court of Exchequer in England, in the Mayor of Carlisle vs. Graham[12]. In pronouncing the judgment of the Court O'Hagan, J., afterwards and now again, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, says: 'According to the well established principles of the Common Law, the proprietors on either side of a river are presumed to be possessed of the bed and soil of it moietively to a supposed line in the middle constituting their legal boundary, and, being so possessed, have an exclusive right to the fishery in the water which flows above their respective territories, though the law secures to the public the right of navigation upon the surface of that water, as a public highway which individuals are forbidden to obstruct, and precludes the riparian proprietors from preventing the progress of the fish through the river. But, whilst the right of fishing in fresh water rivers in which the soil belongs to the riparian proprietors is thus exclusive, the right of fishing in the sea, and in its arms and estuaries, and in its tidal waters, wherever it ebbs and flows, is held by the Common Law to be publici juris, and to belong to all the subjects of the Crown, the soil of the sea and its arms and estuaries and tidal waters being vested in the Sovereign as a trustee for the public.'\nHe proceeds then to demonstrate by reference to authorities that a navigable river, in the sense of the public having a common right to fish in it, must be a tidal river, and that the right to fish therein 'publici juris,' is confined to the ebb and flow of the tide. 'There are,' (he says) 'two kinds of rivers, navigable and not navigable. Every navigable river, so high as the sea ebbs and flows in it, is a royal river, and the fishing of it is a royal fishery and belongs to the King by his prerogative, but in every other river not navigable and in the fishery of such river the terretenants on each side have an interest of common right.' Quoting then Hale[13], he says, 'upon a full consideration of all the cases it will, I think, appear, that no river has been ever held navigable, so as to vest in the crown its bed and soil and in the public the right of fishing, merely because it has been used as a general highway for the purpose of navigation, and that beyond the point to which the sea ebbs and flows, even in a river so used for public purposes, the soil is prim\u00e2 facie in the riparian owners, and the right of fishing private.'\u2014And so he concludes that the public can maintain no claim of right to fish in a river the soil of which is not publici juris but private property. \"In Bloomfield vs. Johnson[14], where the Crown had granted lands adjoining to Lough Erne and islands in the lake, it was held that although the lake was a public navigable highway, yet that being above the flux and reflux of the tide, and although it was held that the ordinary presumption that the bed and soil of a stream opposite their lands belongs to the riparian proprietors, did not extend to a large lake like Lough Erne, the public had not any right of fishing therein of common right.\n\"In Bristow vs. Corcoran[15] it was held by the House of Lords that de jure the Crown had not prim\u00e2 facie a right to the soil or fisheries in a lake like Lough Neagh, and that therefore the plaintiff, who claimed a right of fishing in the lake under a grant from Charles II, had to prove that the King at the time of such grant had an estate to grant; that it was not to be presumed. Lord Cairns there says: 'The lake contains nearly 100,000 acres, but, although it is so large, I am not aware of any rule which could prim\u00e2 facie connect the soil and fisheries with the Crown, or disconnect them from the private ownership of riparian proprietors or other persons' and Lord Blackburn says: 'It is clearly and uniformly laid down in our books that where the soil is covered by water, forming a river in which the tide does not flow, the soil of common right belongs to the adjoining lands, and there is no case or book of authority to shew that the Crown, of common right, is entitled to land covered with water where water is not running water, but still water forming a lake.'\n\"In Malcolmson vs. O'Dea[16], Willes, J., delivering to the House of Lords the opinion of the Judges says; \"The soil of navigable tidal rivers, like the Shannon, so far as the tide ebbs and flows, is prim\u00e2 facie in the Crown and the right of fishing prim\u00e2 facie in the public, but for Magna Charta the Crown could, by its prerogative, exclude the public from such prim\u00e2 facie right, and grant the exclusive right of fishing to a private individual, either together with or distinct from the soil.'\n\"Rolle v. Whyte[17] and Leconfield vs. Lonsdale[18] decide that the provisions of Magna Charta and of the early statutes regulating fisheries, including 17 Ric. 2, ch. 9, and 12 Ed. 4, ch. 7 apply only to rivers navigable in the Common Law sense of the term, i.e. to the flux and reflux of the tide. Rowe vs. Titus[19] and Esson vs. McMaster[20] bear wholly upon a question as to the right of the public to the easement of passage along certain rivers in New Brunswick with boats, rafts and other property, and the rivers were held not to be navigable, but to be of common right public highways upon which the public had a right of passage, to which right the title of the owners of the soil and of the rivers was subservient. No reference is made in these cases to the right of fishing.\n\"The great weight of authority in the United States of America accords with the decisions of the British Courts. In Palmer vs. Mulligan[21] it was held in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kent being C.J., in 1805, that the river Hudson at Stillwater, which is above the flux and reflux of the tide, was not navigable in the Common Law sense of the term, citing the River Bar case[22], Carter vs. Murcot[23], and Hale, de Jure Maris from Hargrave[24].\nKent, C.J., says: 'The Hudson river is capable of being held and enjoyed as private property, but is notwithstanding to be deemed a public highway for public uses, such as that of rafting timber, to which purpose it has heretofore been and still is beneficially subservient.'\n\"In Carson vs. Blazer[25], it was held in the State of Pennsylvania in 1810, that the Patent, under which the proprietors of land abutting on the River Connecticut hold under William Penn, did not pass to them the bed of the river above tide water, or any right of Fishery therein, and that the river and the fisheries therein, above tide water, belonged to the State; the Court in this case held that the Common Law of England rule as to the flux and reflux of the tide determining the character of a navigable river did not apply to a river like the Connecticut: however, in Adams vs. Pease[26] the Supreme Court of the State of Connecticut, in 1818, held that the owners of land adjoining the Connecticut river, above the flow and ebb of the tide, have an exclusive right of fishing opposite to their land to the middle of the stream, but that the public have an easement in the river as a highway for passing and repassing with any kind of water craft; the Chief Justice pronouncing the judgment of the Court says: 'By the Common Law, in the sea, in navigable rivers and in navigable arms of the sea, the right of fishing is common to all. In rivers not navigable, the adjoining proprietors have the exclusive right. Rivers are considered to be navigable in the Common Law sense as far as the sea flows and reflows, and thus far the common right of fishing extends; above the ebbing and flowing of the tide the fishery belongs exclusively to the adjoining proprietors, and the public have a right or easement in such rivers as common highways for passing and repassing with vessels, boats, or any water craft \u2013 a more perfect system of regulations on the subject could not be devised. It secures common rights so far as the public interest requires and furnishes a proper line of demarcation between them and private rights.'\n\"In the People vs. Plait[27], it was held by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in 1818, that the right to take fish in the Saranac, a river falling into Lake Champlain, could not be a public right, for if the river had been granted, the right to take the fish was a private and individual right, and if it had not been granted, yet the right has not become public so as to authorize the entry of any one who might see fit to enter, for the right would belong to the State; and citing Hale, Lord Fitzwalter's case, and Carter vs. Murcott[28] the Court says 'these authorities have never been denied or over-ruled and are of unquestionable authority.' Referring to this case the same Court in 1822, in Hooker vs. Cummings[29], says: 'In the People vs. Platt we recognized the principles of the Common Law to be that in the case of a private river (that is where it is a fresh water river in which tide does not ebb or flow, and is not therefore an arm of the sea) he who owns the soil has prim\u00e2 facie the right of fishing, and if the soil on both sides be owned by one individual he has the sole and exclusive right, but if there be different proprietors on each side they own on their respective sides ad medium filum aquae. We considered in the case referred to, that it was not inconsistent with this right that the river was liable and subject to the public servitude for the passage of boats. The private rights of the owners of the adjacent soil were not otherwise affected than by the river being subject to public use, this is recognised as having been decided in Palmer vs. Mulligan[30], and Adams vs. Pease[31].' And referring to Carson vs. Blazer[32], Spencer, C. J., delivering judgment, says: 'I do not feel myself authorized to reject the principles of the English Common Law by saying that they are not suited to our condition, when I can find no trace of any judicial decision to that effect, nor any legislative declaration or provision leading to such conclusion,' and he adopts the encomium passed upon the Common Law of England by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Connecticut in Adams vs. Pease. The principles to be deduced from all these cases seem to be, that in the estimation of the Common Law all rivers are either navigable or not navigable, and rivers are only said to be navigable so far as the ebb and flow of the tide extends. Rivers may be navigable in fact, that is, capable of being navigated with ships, boats, rafts, &c., &c., yet be classed among the rivers not navigable in the Common Law sense of the term, which is confined to the ebb and flow of the tide. Rivers which are navigable in this sense are also called public, because they are open to public use and enjoyment freely by the whole community, not only for the purposes of passage, but also for fishing, the Crown being restrained by Magna Charta from the exercise of the prerogative of granting a several fishery in that part of any river. Non-navigable rivers, in contrast with navigable or public, are also called private, because although they may be navigable in fact, that is, capable of being traversed with ships, boats, rafts, &c., &c., more or less according to their size and depth, and so subject to a servitude to the public for purposes of passage, yet they are not open to the public for purposes of fishing, but may be owned by private persons, and in common presumption are owned by the proprietors of the adjacent land on either side, who, in right of ownership of the bed of the river, are exclusive owners of the fisheries therein opposite their respective lands on either side to the centre line of the river. Magna Charta does not affect the right of the Crown, nor restrain it in the exercise of its prerogative of granting the bed and soil of any river above the ebb and flow of the tide, or of granting exclusive or partial rights of fishing therein as distinct from any title in the bed or soil, and in fact Crown grants of land adjacent to rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, notwithstanding that such rivers are of the first magnitude, are presumed to convey to the Grantee of such lands the bed or soil of the river, and so to convey the exclusive right of fishing therein to the middle thread of the river opposite to the adjacent land so granted. This presumption may be rebutted, and if, by exception in the grant of the adjacent lands, the bed of the river be reserved, still such reservation does not give to the public any common right of fishing in the river, but the property and ownership of the river, its bed and fisheries remain in the Crown, and the bed of the river may be granted by the Crown, and the grant thereof will carry the exclusive right of fishing therein; or the right of fishing, exclusive or partial, may be granted by the Crown to whomsoever it pleases, just as any private person seized of the bed of the river might dispose thereof. This right extends to all large inland Lakes also, for although in their case the same presumption may not arise as does in the case of rivers, namely, that a grant of the adjacent lands conveys prim\u00e2 facie the bed of the river, (as was decided in Bloomfield vs. Johnson) still, the prerogative right of the Crown to grant the bed of rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, not being affected by the restraints imposed by Magna Charta, cannot be questioned, for all title of the subject is derived from the Crown, and so if a bed of a river, or the right of fishing therein, be reserved by the Crown from a grant of adjacent lands, the right and title so reserved remains in the Crown, in the same manner as it would have vested in the grantee if not reserved, and is not subject to any common right of fishing in the public; for, as was said by Lord Abinger, O. J., in Hull vs. Selby Ry. Co.[33], 'as all title of the subject is derived from the Crown, the Crown holds by the same rights and with the same limitations as its grantee.' So in Bloomfield vs. Johnson above cited, it was held that a grant by the Crown of a free fishery in the waters of Lough Erne did not pass a several or exclusive right of fishery therein, but only a license to fish on the property of the grantor, and that the several fishery remained in the Crown subject to such grants or licenses to fish as it might grant. In old Canada the right of the Crown to make such grants of the bed of the great lakes is recognized by Act of Parliament.\n\"Although the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown to grant a several fishery in waters where the tide ebbs and flows is restrained by Magna Charta, still the right of Parliament in its wisdom (in the exercise of its paramount control in the interests of the public, and as the exponent of the voice of the nation as regards all property,) to authorize such grants there, equally as in waters above the ebb and flow of the tide, is undoubted.\n\"I speak here of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the like power, over all subjects placed by the British North America Act under the control of the Parliament of Canada, is vested in that Parliament.\n\"As regards then the particular river in question, at the place in question, above Price's Bend, notwithstanding that it may be true that it is subject to a servitude to the public for a common right of passage over its waters, as to which I express no opinion, inasmuch as the determination of that point is unnecessary in the case before me, but assuming the river to be subject to such servitude, still, the river there partakes not of a character of a navigable or public, but of non-navigable or private river, in the sense in which these terms are used in law, and the public have no common right of fishing therein.\n\"The prim\u00e2 facie presumption being that the owners of the adjacent lands are owners of the bed of the river, which presumption may be rebutted, it is necessary now to consider the point, which is urged upon behalf of the Crown as representing the Dominion Government in this case, namely that the presumption is rebutted by matter appearing upon the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, which is made part of the case and has been produced in evidence, for, if not rebutted, the exclusive right of fishing passed by that grant to the Company, and the Act of Parliament, 31 Vic., c. 60, does not affect, or in its 2nd section profess to deal with, any fisheries in which an exclusive right of fishing had been conveyed by the Crown and was vested in any persons at the time of the passing of the Act.\n\"The clause in the letters patent conveying the land to the land company which is relied upon in support of this contention is the latter part of the exception above extracted, namely: 'And also further excepting the bed and waters of the Miramichi River, and the beds and waters of all the rivers and streams which empty themselves either into the River St. John or the River Nashwaak, so far up the said rivers and streams respectively as the same respectively pass through, or over any of the said heretofore previously granted tracts, pieces or parcels of land hereinbefore excepted.'\n\"This exception, it is urged, is open to two constructions, the one that insisted upon by Mr. Lash, upon behalf of the Dominion Government, namely: that the bed of the Miramichi River is excepted absolutely throughout its whole length, and the beds of the other rivers and streams flowing into the River St. John and Nashwaak qualifiedly, that is to say, \"so far up those rivers and streams respectively, &c., &c.\", and the other that insisted on by Mr. Haliburton, upon behalf of the Suppliants, namely: that the qualification involved in the words 'So far up the river and streams respectively, &c., &c.,' is to be attached to the exception as to the bed of the Miramichi River as well as to the beds of the other rivers and streams mentioned in the same sentence.\n\"Which of these two constructions is the correct one depends upon the determination of the question\u2014what should be held to have been the intention of the Crown in making the grant of the lands mentioned in the letters patent containing the exception? 'It is always' (says Sir John Coleridge, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Lord vs. City of Sidney[34] upon a question as to the construction of a Crown grant) 'a question of intention to be collected from the language used with reference to the surrounding circumstances. Words in an instrument of grant, as elsewhere, are to be taken in the sense in which the common usage of mankind has applied to them in reference to the context in which they are found.' And the same construction, I may add, is to be put upon words in a grant of land by the Crown which has been established by the decisions of the Courts to be the proper construction to be put upon the same words in a grant between subject and subject. Now, for the purpose of assisting in arriving at the intention of the Crown as to the use of the above words in the letters patent to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, as well as for the purposes of the 6th Question in the special case, namely: '6thly have the grantees in grants of lots bounded by the said rivers or by any part thereof and excepted from the said company's grant any exclusive or other right of fishing in said river opposite their respective grants?' copies of 16 letters patent have been produced, 5 of which grant lands situate upon the Miramichi, and 9 lands situate upon the other rivers and streams mentioned in the letters patent to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company running through the tract of land granted to that Company, falling into the rivers St. John and Nashwaak, and it is admitted that all other grants to others within the lines constituting the boundaries of the tract described in the letters patent to the company are in similar form to those of which the copies have been supplied. Copies also of two letters patent granting large tracts of land amounting to about 25,000 acres, immediately outside of and abutting upon the limits of tract described in the letters patent to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, have been produced.\n\"From a perusal of these several letters patent, it appears that, as regards the title to the soil and beds of the said several rivers alike, the language of all the letters patent is the same, the practice of the Crown was uniform throughout. Now, the established rule of law is that prim\u00e2 facie the proprietor of each bank of a stream is the proprietor of half the land covered by the stream, and that a description which extends 'to the water's edge,' or 'to a river' or 'to the river's bank,' or which begins at a stake, tree, or other monument 'by the side of a river' or 'in a river's bank,' and which runs 'up' or 'down the river,' or 'its bank,' or 'by the side of the river,' or 'following its courses,' or to a stake, tree, or monument 'by the side of the river,' or 'on the river's bank,' or the like, carries the grant to the thread of the stream. In all such cases, the grant covers the bed of the stream, unless there be some expression in the terms of the grant, or something in the terms of the grant taken in connection with the situation and condition of the land granted, which clearly indicates an intention that the grant should stop at the edge or margin of the river, and should exclude the river from its operation. There must be a reservation or restriction, expressed or necessarily implied, to control the general presumption of law and to make the particular grant an exception from the general rule. This is the established doctrine, not only in England, but in the Courts of the United States of America also, as will sufficiently appear from the cases already cited and from Wright vs. Howard[35], Kairns vs. Turville[36], Tyler vs. Wilkinson[37], Robertson vs. Whyte[38], Lowell vs. Robinson[39], Child vs. Starr[40], Luce vs. Carley[41], Howard vs. Ingersoll[42], and Chancellor Kent's Comm vol. 3, p. 427.\n\"Tried acording to the principle laid down in the above cases, it cannot admit of a doubt that the description of boundaries in every one of the letters patent which have been produced and above referred to include and convey to the several grantees of the land therein respectively described the soil and bed, not only of all the streams and rivers which flow into the rivers St. John and Nashwaak, but also of the river Miramichi, and in truth of the Nashwaak itself, where the rivers pass through or abut upon the lands described, and as it is part of the admissions in the case, that all other grants of land situate within the outside limits of the tracts described in the letters patent of the 5th November 1835, to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company, are in like form with those above recited, it must be concluded as not admitting of a doubt, that every grant which had been made, prior to the 5th November, 1835, of land lying within the limits of the description of the tract described in the letters patent of that date, passed and conveyed to the several grantees of such lands without exception the bed and soil of the river Miramichi, as well as the bed and soil of all the rivers and streams flowing into the St. John and Nashwaak, in accordance with the general presumption and rule of law when the lands granted abutted upon any of the said rivers.\n\"This being established, it only remains to be considered whether the terms of the grant contained in the letters patent of the 5th November, 1835, are so explicit as to reverse the general presumption of law, and to indicate clearly the intention of the Crown to be to make the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company an exceptional grant and different in this particular from all prior grants made by the Crown in that locality, and which, within the limits mentioned in the letters patent of the 5th November 1835, comprised 206,000 acres of the 795,000 acres constituting the gross contents of the tract, the outside limits of which are given in those letters patent.\n\"We must reasonably conclude that the object of the grant to the Company was to use the company as an instrument for facilitating the settlement of the Province of New Brunswick, in like manner as in the case of a similar grant, which had been made some years previously in Canada, to the Canada Company. It was necessary to the full enjoyment of the grant and to ensure success to the undertaking of the Company by the settlement of the Country, that the settlers should have the right and power to erect mills and to use the power of the rivers by dams across them for the purpose of driving the mills; this they could not do in those rivers or streams, if any there were, whose beds and soil were excepted from the grant to the Company.\n\"No possible reason has been suggested or can be assigned why the Crown should make the grant to this Company an exception from all previous grants made in the same locality, and so obstruct what must have been the object of the grant, namely, the settlement of the Province; or why the River Miramichi should be made an exception from all the other rivers and streams; or why the River Mirami hi itself, where in its course it abutted upon lands granted to the Company, should be excluded from the grant, while the soil and bed of the same river, where it abutted upon land granted to other persons, had been included in those grants and passed to the respective grantees of the adjoining lands;\u2014or, in the language of the Judgment of the Privy Council in Lord vs. the Commissioners of the City of Sidney[43], 'why the Crown should have reserved what might be directly and immediately useful to the grantees, and could not have been contemplated to be of any use to the Crown, and this too in an infant Colony where it was the manifest and avowed policy to encourage settlement and the cultivation of lands by grant on the easiest and most favorable terms.'\n\"We must then give to the letters patent of the 5th November, 1835, such a construction as shall be consistent with the previous uniform practice of the Crown and with the general presumption of law, and so as to make the grant valuable in view of the purpose which it must have had in view, and not so as to derogate from that value, unless the terms and expressions in the grant are so peremptory and clear as to place beyond doubt that the intention of the Crown was to exclude from the grant to the Company the bed of the Miramichi River, where it abuts upon lands granted to the Company. The only construction, which, in accordance with the above principles, can, in my judgment, be properly given to the letters patent of the 5th November, 1835 is, that the exception therein affects the Miramichi only in the same manner, and to the same extent, as it affects the other rivers and streams therein mentioned, namely: all those falling into the rivers St. John and Nashwaak, and consequently that the exception is limited to the bed and soil of the Miramichi river, as it is to the bed and soil of the said other rivers and streams, namely, opposite to the lands which had previously been granted on the banks of the rivers.\n\"The form of the description in the letters patent of the 5th November, which the draftsman has made to comprehend within the limit of the tract described 206,000 acres which had already been granted, much of which was situate upon the banks of the said several rivers, made it necessary to except from the grant to the company whatever had been previously granted and the bed and soil of the rivers opposite the lands so granted. This affords a rational cause, and indeed the only apparent rational cause for the exception being inserted at all, and consequently the letters patent must be so construed as to limit the application of the exception to this rational purpose. It was suggested that if the bed and soil of the rivers opposite to the lands previously granted had passed to the grantees of such lands, the exception of those lands, which is also expressed in the letters patent of the 5th November, would have been sufficient to comprehend also the beds of the rivers; but, granting this to be so, it is plain that whether the beds of the rivers had or not passed by the previous grants of lands situate on their banks, the draftsman of the letters patent of the 5th Novembe. has, ex majori cauteld, inserted an express exception of the beds of the rivers and streams flowing into the St. John and Nashwaak, where such rivers and streams abutted on lands already granted. This is not disputed, but the contention is, that in the case of the Miramichi, the exception is not to be construed as being so limited, but is absolute. But for this distinction, no reason whatever is suggested, and I have shewn that in the previous grants the Miramichi river was precisely in the same position as all the other rivers, and that in the case of all alike the beds of rivers abutting on lands granted had been granted and had passed to the grantees of lands.\n\"The letters patent are capable of the construction, that the exception shall be limited in the case of the Miramichi, equally as in the case of the other rivers and streams, and as that construction is most consistent with the uniform practice of the Crown, and with what must have been the object of the company, in acquiring the lands granted, with the general presumption of law, and with reason and common sense, that is the construction which must be given to the letters patent. It follows that the Miramichi river, where the lands granted to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company abut upon it, is excluded from the operation of the Fisheries Act 31 Vic. c. 60, for there an exclusive right of fishing had passed to the company, their successors and assigns, by the letters patent of the 5th November 1835.\n\"It was urged, it is true, but scarcely I think seriously, that by force of the 108 sec. of the British North America Act, and of the 5th item of the 3rd schedule annexed to the Act, namely: 'Rivers and Lake improvements,' the bed and soil of the Miramichi, as well as the beds and soil of every river in the Dominion, is declared to be 'the property of Canada.' The sole ground for this contention is that the word 'Rivers' as printed in the schedule is plural, while the word 'Lake' is singular, and that if it had been intended that the word 'improvements' should be read in connection with the former as with the latter it would have been printed 'River' in the singular as in the word 'Lake.' To this it was replied, that the absence of a comma after the word 'Rivers' afforded as good an argument, that the word 'Improvements' was intended to be read in connection with the word 'Rivers' as with 'Lake,' notwithstanding the affix of a final 'S' to the former. I confess I think both arguments are of about equal weight, and I do not think it profitable to enquire whether the affix of the letter 'S' or the omission of a comma is the act of the printer or of Parliament, for by 108 section of the Act, it is clear that the things which are by that section, made the property of Canada are 'the public works and property of each Province' enumerated in the 3rd schedule. Whether, therefore, the word be printed 'River' or 'Rivers' in the 3rd schedule the result is the same, and the word 'Improvements' must be read with it, to indicate the 'Public Work' which having been the property of the Province in which it had been situate is made the property of Canada.\n\"I have thus substantially answered all or most of the questions submitted in this special case, but it may be convenient briefly to give my answers thus:\n\"The first, third, fourth and sixth questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the second and seventh in the negative.\n\"To the 5th it is unnecessary to give any special answer, as I am of opinion that the bed of the river did pass to the Company. However, it may be said, that if it had not so passed, the case offers no evidence of any exclusive right of fishing therein having passed to the Company, which right in such case could only be by grant or prescription. I have in my judment explained at length my views upon the rights of riparian proprietors and of what is meant by that term.\n\"To the 8th it may be answered, that if what is meant by this question as framed is, whether the Minister of Marine and Fisheries could lawfully issue a lease of the bed of the River, where it passes through ungranted lands, I am of opinion that he could not, but that the Act does authorize him to issue, and therefore he could lawfully issue, a license to fish, as a franchise apart from the ownership of the soil in that portion of the River.\n\"The 109 sec. of the British North America Act already quoted declares that 'all lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate.' Now, whether this section is to be regarded as sufficient to transfer the legal estate in those lands to the several Provinces as corporations, or as a declaration merely that they shall be held by the Crown in trust for, and as part of the public demesne of, the respective Provinces, matters not, as it appears to me, in so far as the question under consideration is concerned, for what is declared shall belong to the newly created Provinces is that which at the Union belong to the provinces as formerly constituted, and those lands which had not yet been granted were already subject to a like provision in virtue of Acts of Parliament relating to the Fisheries in existence before the Union, which Acts, the 129 section of the British North America Act declares shall continue in existence after the Union until repealed, abolished or altered by Act of the Dominion Parliament. The effect then of the 109th section must be to make the lands part of the public Domain of the respective Provinces, subject to the provisions of the several Acts in force relating to the fisheries at the time of the Union, and to such other or the like provisions as the Parliament of Canada should enact upon the subject of the Fisheries, treating that term as relating to the incorporeal hereditament or libera piscaria as already explained, which subject was placed under the exclusive control of the Parliament, and the expression in the 2nd section of the Dominion Act, 31 Vic., ch. 60, namely, 'where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law' must, I think, be construed to include that part of the public domain in the respective provinces consisting of ungranted lands, over which, not having been converted into private property, no exclusive right of fishing could be legally established by any person.\n\"Over those ungranted lands the Dominion Parliament had, in my judgment, for the reasons already given above, the undoubted right to legislate in the manner provided by the 2nd section of the 31 Vic., c. 60, and that section does, I think, sufficiently cover those lands which, prior to the passing of 31 Vic., c. 60, were, as I have shewn, subject to a like provision, and the frame of the 2nd section of that Act, when compared with the corresponding sections in the Acts which were in force until repealed by 31 Vic., c. 60, leads to the conclusion that the same lands were referred to in the latter Act as in the like connection were referred to in the former, namely, ungranted public lands.\n\"I have entered into the subject as fully as I could, in order that I might make my judgment upon all the points as clear as I am capable of doing, for the reason that in the event of an appeal I shall not sit upon the case in appeal. The Court of Exchequer being composed of the same Judges as are the judges of the Supreme Court, an appeal from the judgment of a single judge of the Court of Exchequer to the Supreme Court is in substance and effect simply an appeal from one of the Judges to the full Court. To avoid the possible anomaly of the full Court being divided, and the judgment nevertheless of one of the Judges of the divided Court remaining of record as a judgment of the Court, it is a point worthy of Parliamentary consideration, whether it may not be expedient to enact that an appeal from a single Judge of the Exchequer Court should be heard only by the other Judges, so that in every case of appeal from the Exchequer Court in order to sustain any judgment, as the judgment of the Court, there should be a majority of all the Judges constituting the Court in favor of it.\n\"The constitution of the Court of Exchequer makes a marked difference between the case of an appeal from that Court, when the Appellate Court is divided, and the case of an appeal from an independent Court consisting of other Judges than those constituting the appellate tribunal when the latter is divided.\n\"The Judgment of the Court therefore is that a rule shall issue in the terms of the provisions of the special case, referring it to the Registrar to take an account as agreed upon by the concluding paragraph of the case\"\nThe following rule was taken out:\n\"The special case stated by the parties for the opinion of this court having come on to be heard and debated before this court in the presence of counsel for the suppliant and for her Majesty. Upon debate of the matter and hearing what was alleged by counsel on each side and upon reading the documents and papers filed, this court did order that the said case should stand over for judgment, and the same coming on this day for judgment this court doth order and declare that the first, third, fourth and sixth questions submitted in said special case should be answered in the affirmative and the second and seventh questions in the negative. This court doth further declare that it is unnecessary to give any special answer to the fifth question as this court is of opinion that the bed of the south west Miramichi river within the limits of the grant to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company and above the grants mentioned and reserved therein did pass to the said company.\n\"This court doth further declare with reference to the eighth question that, if what is meant by this question be whether the Minister of Marine and Fisheries could lawfully issue a lease of the bed of the river where it passes through ungranted lands, this court is of opinion that the said minister could not lawfully issue such lease, but this court is of opinion that the said minister could lawfully issue a license to fish as a franchise apart from the ownership of the soil in that portion of the river.\"\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for the Crown, moved, pursuant to rule No. 231 of the Exchequer Court rules, for an order nisi calling upon the suppliant to shew cause why the judgment rendered by the court upon the special case in this matter should not be reviewed and judgment given thereon for the Crown, upon the grounds, that the second question submitted in said special case should have been answered in the affirmative, and that the third, fourth, fifth and sixth questions should have been answered in the negative. This motion was refused.\nFrom this decision the Crown appealed.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for the Crown:\nIn this appeal the appellant will raise only the main question involved, viz: whether or not an exclusive right of fishing, at the time the fishing lease was granted to the respondent, previously existed by law in the leased portion of the river. The reason the 8th question was submitted for the decision of the Exchequer Court was that we thought part of the locus in quo was through ungranted land, and it has since been ascertained that no part of the locus in quo is through ungranted land.\nHad the Minister of Marine and Fisheries power to issue the lease in question?\nThis depends upon there being no exclusive right of fishing, at the time the lease was made, in the leased portion of the river.\nAn exclusive right of fishing may exist, 1st in a private river, 2nd in a public river.\nThe first paragraph of the special case shows what the nature of that portion of the Miramichi River is: \"It is above tidal waters, and is navigable for canoes and boats, and has been used from the earliest settlement of the country as a highway for the same and for the purpose of floating down timber and logs to market.\" My contention is shortly this, that in this country the absence of the ebb and flow of the tide does not make a river a private one,\u2014if the contrary is held, then all the great fresh water rivers in Canada are private\u2014and that this river, being admitted to be navigable for the purposes of passage and being used as a highway, is a public river, and no exclusive right of fishing exists in it, as no grant or prescription thereof is shewn.\n2 Broom & Hadley's, Com. (Edition of 1869) page 107; 2 Stephens Com. (1874) pages 670-1-2; 2 Kerr's Blackstone (1857) page 39; Warren vs. Matthews[44].\nIf the Miramichi be a private river, it may be admitted that the owner would have the exclusive right of fishing.\nIs it a private river? Ebb and flow of the tide is not the proper test: Lyon vs. Fishmongers Co.[45]; Mayor, &c. vs. Brooke[46]; Carter vs. Murcot[47], confirming Warren vs. Matthews; Genesee Chief vs. Fitzhugh[48], confirmed by The Magnolia[49], also the reference to Broom & Hadley & Stephen & Kerr, above mentioned; Mayor, &c vs. Turner[50]; Miles vs. Rose[51].\nThe navigable capacity need not continue throughout the whole year: Olson vs. Merril[52].\nI do not argue that the bed of the river did not pass, and I can only argue on the assumption that the terms of the special case make the Miramichi a highway and a public river, and if so no exclusive right of fishing exists in it: Thomson's essay on Magna Charta[53]; Mayor, &c., vs. Brooke[54]; Duke of Somerset vs. Fogwell[55]; also references to Broom & Hadley, Stephen & Kerr above mentioned.\nIn England it is well settled that in a navigable river there can be no exclusive right of fishing unless such right existed prior to Magna Charta.\nBut it is contended by respondent that a navigable river is in law navigable only so far as the tide ebbs and flows, and that though navigable in fact above tide water, it is not navigable in law, and that therefore the incidents attaching to a river navigable in law, do not attach to one navigable only in fact.\nThe appellant denies this contention, but even if such be law in England it is not law in Canada, as the size and situation of the two countries are so different.\nIn New Brunswick only so much of the law of England as was applicable to the circumstances of the Province when it was first created is in force.\nIn England, where navigation was practically confined to the tidal portion of a river\u2014where in fact navigable water and tide water were synonymous terms, and tide water, with a few small and unimportant exceptions, meant nothing more than public rivers as contra-distinguished from private ones\u2014it was reasonable enough that the ebb and flow of the tide should have been taken as the test of the navigability of a river, as it was the most convenient test, but such a test was and is inapplicable to this country, and was not imported here as part of the Common Law.\nWaters here navigable in fact are so regarded in law, without reference to the ebb and flow of the tide, and if a river be navigable in law all the incidents of navigability attach to it, and one of those incidents is the right of the public to fish therein: see Atty. Gen. vs. Harrison[56]; Carson vs. Blazer[57]; McManus vs. Carmichael[58].\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Is there any objection in holding that a river may be public for certain purposes and private for all other purposes?]\nSo far as this river is concerned there is none, and where there is no exclusive right to fish, then Parliament can take away the public right by statute, as was done by the Fisheries Act.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Robinson & Joseph's Digest, (Ont.) Vo. \"Water;\" People vs. Canal Appraisers[59]; Ball vs. Herbert[60]; Dixon vs. Scnetsinger[61].\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., for respondent:\nIt has to be admitted that according to the English cases the decision of Mr. Justice Gwynne must be affirmed. This is practically an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which has held that this was a private river, and that the license issued by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of the locus in quo is void.\nRivers may be divided into three classes:\nI. When they are altogether private, such as shallow streams, not capable to be put to any particular use.\nII. When they are private property, but capable of, and subject to, the public use. The case of non-tidal waters.\nIII. Where the use and property are public, where the tide ebbs and flows.\nBy the 3rd section of 31 Victoria, cap. 60, sec. 2, the power to grant leases is given only where the exclusive right does not already exist by law. It is submitted that the exclusive right did exist in the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company, under the grant. The river is clearly within its boundaries, and the exception shows the intention of the Crown to include it in the grant, except where already granted.\nIn non-tidal rivers, the right of the riparian proprietors extends to the middle of the stream, and where both banks are the property of the same owner, the whole right of property in the stream belongs to him: Beckett vs. Morris[62].\nOn page 58, Lord Cranworth says: \"By the Laws of Scotland, as by the Law of England, when the lands of two continuous properties are separated from each other by a running stream of water, each proprietor is prim\u00e2 facie owner of the soil of the shores or bed of the river ad medium filum aqu\u00e6.\"\nIn navigable rivers or arms of the sea, fishing is common and public. In private rivers, not navigable, it belongs to the lords of the soil on each side: Carter vs. Murcott[63]; Malcolmson vs. O'Dea[64]; Marshall vs. Ulleswater Steam Navigation Company[65]. The rights of riparian proprietors are very fully discussed in the case of Lyons vs. Fishmongers Co.[66] and Byron vs. Stimpson[67].\nThe petitioners also rely upon the judgments of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Robertson vs. Steadman[68], and the cases therein cited.\nAs to the construction of sea coast and fisheries, see remarks of Lord Selborne in L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal vs. Belisle[69].\nEven assuming that the land in these rivers is vested in the Crown, it is contended that the Crown only held it in trust for the people of New Brunswick.\nBy the British North America Act, secs. 109 and 117, the Crown Lands of the Province of New Brunswick are the property, so to speak, of the Province, and therefore the incidents of right appurtenant to the property belong to the Province, otherwise this anomaly would exist, that while the lands were ungranted, the Dominion of Canada would have the right to dispose or lease the fishery, but so soon as a grant was made under the great seal of the Province of New Brunswick, then it would belong to the grantee.\nThis point is put forcibly by his Honor Mr. Justice Fisher, in the case of Robertson vs. Steadman[70] in his dissenting opinion.\nIt is submitted, then, that by law, within the limits of the fluvial or angling division described in the lease to the petitioner, the exclusive right of fishing existed and therefore that the Dominion of Canada had not, under the Act of Union, nor under the Act of the Parliament of Canada 31 Vict. cap. 60, power to grant such lease, and therefore the same became null and void, and the petitioner being damnified has a claim upon the Government for the damage sustained. Mr. Lash, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J. [After reading the statement of the case, proceeded as follows]:\nAs the lease in question professes to deal only with the right of fishing in that part of the Miramichi River described as \"the fluvial or angling division of the South-West Miramichi River from Price's Bend to its source,\" we are relieved from the necessity of considering in whom the rights of fishing are in the Miramichi River from or below Price's Bend to its mouth, it being described in the case as being\u2014\nAfter the St. John the largest river in New Brunswick is the Miramichi, flowing northward into an extensive bay of its own name. It is 225 miles in length and seven miles wide at its mouth. It is navigable for large vessels twenty-five miles from the gulf, and for schooners twenty-five miles further to the head of the tide, above which for sixty miles it is navigable for tow-boats. The river has many large tributaries spreading over a great extent of country.\nFrom Price's Bend to its source the river is thus described:\u2014\nPrice's Bend is about forty or forty-five miles above the ebb and flow of the tide. The stream for the greater part from this point, upward, is navigable for canoes, small boats, flat bottomed scows, logs and timber. Logs are usually driven down the river in high water in the spring and fall. The stream is rapid. During summer it is in some places on the bars very shallow. In the salmon fishing season, say June, July and August, canoes have to be hauled over the very shallow bars by hand.\nThe questions involved in the case submitted, resolve themselves substantially into these:\nWhat are the rights of fishing in a river or a portion of a river such as is that part of the Miramichi from Price's Bend to its source? Do the rights of property therein belong to the Provincial Government, or their grantees, or to the Dominion Government, or their licensees, or have the Dominion Government, or the Provincial Government, legislative control over such proprietary rights? And is there any distinction between the rights of the grantees from the Provincial Government before confederation or after, and of the Provincial Government itself? that is, assuming the Dominion Government cannot deal with or take away the rights of the grantees of the crown before confederation, can they do so in respect to the ungranted lands of the provinces granted since confederation? In other words, can the Dominion Parliament authorize the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to issue licenses to parties to fish in rivers such as that described where the lands are ungranted, or where the Provincial Government has before or after confederation granted lands that are bounded on or that extend across such rivers?\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, satisfactorily to deal with this case and ignore any of these questions, the principles applicable to and governing all being the same, and therefore their determination will consequently answer all the questions submitted and settle this appeal.\nThe observations I am about to make are designedly confined to rivers such as the Miramichi from Price's Bend to its source.\nIn construing the British North America Act, I think no hard and fast canon or rule of construction can be laid down and adopted by which all acts passed as well by the Parliament of Canada as by the local legislatures upon all and every question that may arise can be effectually tested as to their being or not being intra vires of the legislature passing them. The nearest approach to a rule of general application that has occurred to me for reconciling the apparently conflicting legislative powers under the British North America Act, is what I suggested in the cases of Valin v. Langlois[71] and The Citizen's Insurance Co. v. Parsons[72], with respect to property and civil rights, over which exclusive legislative authority is given to the local legislatures: that, as there are many matters involving property and civil rights expressly reserved to the Dominion Parliament, the power of the local legislatures must, to a certain extent, be subject to the general and special legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament. But while the legislative rights of the local legislatures are in this sense subordinate to the rights of the Dominion Parliament, I think such latter rights must be exercised so far as may be consistently with the rights of the local legislatures, and therefore the Dominion Parliament would only have the right to interfere with property and civil rights in so far as such interference may be necessary for the purpose of legislating generally and effectually in relation to matters confided to the Parliament of Canada. And this view I think was clearly in the mind of the Privy Council when in Cushing v. Dupuy[73], in speaking of the powers of the dominion and provincial legislatures, it is said in the judgment of the Privy Council by Sir M. E. Smith:\u2014\nIt is therefore to be presumed, indeed it is a necessary implication, that the Imperial statute, in assigning to the Dominion Parliament the subjects of bankruptcy and insolvency, intended to confer on it legislative power to interfere with property, civil rights and procedure within the provinces, so far as a general law relating to those subjects might affect them.\nAnd this view is, I venture to think, substantially indorsed by the Privy Council in the case of Parsons v. The Citizen's Insurance Co., decided in November last. There the Privy Council say as to the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, relating to the distribution of legislative powers between the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces, that owing to the very general language in which some of these powers are described, the question is one of considerable difficulty; and after referring to the first branch of section 91, the Privy Council say:\nAn endeavour appears to have been made to provide for cases of apparent conflict; and it would seem that with this object it was declared in the second branch of the 91st section, for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of the section, that (notwithstanding anything in the Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada should extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects enumerated in that section. With the same object, apparently, the paragraph at the end of sec. 91 was introduced, though it may be observed that this paragraph applies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of sec. 92. Notwithstanding this endeavour to give pre-eminence to the Dominion Parliament in cases of a conflict of powers, it is obvious that in some cases where this apparent conflict exists, the legislature could not have intended that the powers exclusively assigned to the provincial legislature should be absorbed in those given to the Dominion Parliament.\nAnd then we find language which I humbly think sanctions to its fullest extent the principle I have heretofore ventured to promulgate as applicable to the interpretation of the British North America Act in this admittedly most difficult question:\nWith regard to certain classes of subjects, therefore, generally described in sec. 91, legislative power may reside as to some matters falling within the general description of these subjects in the legislatures of the provinces. In these cases it is the duty of the courts, however difficult it may be, to ascertain in what degree, and to what extent, authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature, and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers. It could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist; and in order to prevent such a result, the language of the two sections must be read together, and that of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified by that of the other. In this way it may, in most cases, be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain, and give effect to all of them. In performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for those on whom it is thrown to decide each case which arises as best they can, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nAnd saying they find no sufficient reason in the language itself, nor in the other parts of the act, for giving so narrow an interpretation to the words \"civil rights,\" and that the words are sufficiently large to embrace, in their fair and ordinary meaning, rights arising from contract, and such rights are not included in any of the enumerated classes of subjects in section 91, they add this important proposition bearing on the case in hand as applicable to \"Property and Civil Rights\":\nIt becomes obvious, as soon as an attempt is made to construe the general terms in which the classes of subjects in sections 91 and 92 are described, that both sections and the other parts of the Act must be looked at to ascertain whether language of a general nature must not by necessary implication or reasonable intendment be modified and limited.\nAfter referring to the 14 Geo. III, ch. 83, which made provision for the government of the Province of Quebec, and by section 8 of which it was enacted, that His Majesty's Canadian subjects within the Province of Quebec should enjoy their property, usages and other civil rights as they had before done, and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort should be had to the laws of Canada, and be determined agreeably to the said laws, they say:\nIn this statute the words \"property\" and \"civil rights\" are plainly used in their largest sense, and there is no reason for holding that in the statute under discussion they are used in a different and narrower one.\nAnd after instancing the subject of marriage and divorce in section 91 and observing \"it is evident that the solemnization of marriage would have come within this general description yet 'solemnization of marriage in the Province' is enumerated among the classes of subjects in section 92,\" the Privy Council say:\u2014 No one can doubt, notwithstanding the general language of section 91, that this subject is still within the exclusive authority of the legislatures of the provinces. So \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\" is enumerated among the classes of subjects in section 91, but though the description is sufficiently large and general to include direct taxation within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes,\" assigned to the provincial legislatures by section 92, it obviously could not have been intended that, in this instance also, the general power should override the particular one.\nLet us now refer to the sections of the British North America Act bearing on the present case, and guided by considerations such as these, I think the act can be so read as to avoid all conflict and give to each legislative body the full legislative and proprietary rights intended to be conferred by the Imperial Parliament.\nBy section 91, sub-section 12, is confided to the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, \"Sea coast and Inland Fisheries;\" to the exclusive power of the provincial legislatures by section 92, sub-section 13, \"Property and civil rights in the provinces;\" and, by sub-section 16, \"Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the provinces;\" and by section 108 certain public works and property specified in schedule 3 are declared to be the property of Canada; and by section 109, \"All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces shall belong to the several provinces in which they are situate, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same;\" and by section 92, sub-section 5, the exclusive power of legislation is conferred on the provincial legislatures in relation to \"the management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon.\"\nI am of opinion that the Miramichi, from Price's Bend to its source, is not a public river on which the public have a right to fish, and though the public may have an easement or right to float rafts or logs down, and a right of passage up and down in canoes, &c., in times of freshet in the spring and autumn, or whenever the water is sufficiently high to enable the river to be so used, I am equally of opinion that such aright is not in the slighest degree inconsistent with an exclusive right of fishing, or with the rights of the owners of property opposite their respective lands ad medium filum aqu\u00e6; or, when the lands on each side of the river belong to the same person, the same exclusive right of fishing in the whole river so far as his land extends along the same. There is no connection whatever between a right of passage and a right of fishing. A right of passage is an easement, that is to say, a privilege without profit, as in a common highway. A right to catch fish is a profit \u00e0 prendre, subject no doubt to the free use of the river as a highway and to the private rights of others. This right of private property in rivers such as that portion of the Miramichi we are dealing with has always been recognized at common law.\nIn Hudson vs. Mac Rae[74], an information before two justices for unlawfully and wilfully attempting to take fish in water where another person had a right of private fishing, the accused justified under a supposed right on the part of the public to fish in that water.\nIt was conceded such a right of fishing by the public in a non-navigable river could not exist in law, and that accused, justifying himself under the bon\u00e2 fide, though mistaken notion, of such a right, did not make such a claim of right as ousted the jurisdiction of the justices.\nBlackburn, J., says:\u2014\nIt appears that the appellant was fishing in a private river with every circumstance necessary to warrant conviction, but he showed in his defence that for many years the public at large fished there under the notion of a right. The justices have found that he acted under the bon\u00e2 fide belief in that right, but then in point of law such a right could not be obtained in a non-navigable river.\nIf the title to property comes in question, the justices must hold their hands.\nBlackburn, J., says:\u2014\nBut when the claim set up is of a right which could by no possibility exist, it cannot be said that the right of property comes in question; there is then nothing more than this, that the man has got in his head an unfounded notion of a right impossible in law. * * * Here is a non-navigable river where the public could not possibly have a right of fishing.\nRace v. Ward[75], declaration for breaking and entering plaintiffs close and committing trespass. Defendant justified under an immemorial custom for all inhabitants for the time being of said township to have liberty and privilege to have and take water from certain spring in said close, &c.\nLord Campbell, C. J., says:\u2014\nIn Wickham v. Hawker[76] the Court of Exchequer held that \"a liberty, with servants or otherwise, to come into and upon lands, and there to hawk, hunt, fish and fowl,\" is a profit \u00e0 prendre within the prescription Act[77].\n* * * * * *\nWe held, last term, that to a declaration for breaking and entering the plaintiff's close and taking his fish, a custom pleaded for all the parish to angle and catch fish in the locus in quo, was bad, as this was a profit \u00e0 prendre, and might lead to the destruction of the subject-matter to which the alleged custom applied.\nCase referred to was Bland v. Lipscombe, 4 E. & B. 713 note.\nLord Campbell, C. J.:\u2014\nWe must act upon that salutary law which distinguishes between a mere easement and the right to take a profit.\n* * * * * *\nIt is clear to me that the custom claimed in this plea is to angle for, catch, and carry away the fish; but, supposing it were limited, as Mr. Brown argues, to a claim to angle for and catch the fish without claiming a right to carry them away, I think it would be equally destructive of the subject-matter, and bad.\nMussett v. Burch[78] decides that the right of the public to fish in a non-tidal river which is made navigable by locks cannot exist in law.\nCleaseby, B., says:\nNow it appears to me that the case in the Irish reports (Murphy v. Ryan) is decisive on the point before us. It expressly decides that \"the public cannot acquire by immemorial usage any right of fishing in a river in which, though it be navigable, the tide does not ebb and flow.\"\nGrove, J.:\u2014\nMr. Graham has not shown us any case in which the public have been held to have a right of fishing in a river merely because it is navigable or navigated by boats.\nIn Wishart vs. Wyllie[79], the Lord Chancellor laid it down that the law on this subject admitted of no doubt.\nIf, said his lordship, a stream separates properties A and B, prim\u00e2 facie, the owner of the land A, as to his land, on one side, and the owner of the land B, as to his land, on the other, are each entitled to the soil of the stream, usque ad mediam aqu\u00e6, that is prim\u00e2 facie so. It may be rebutted, but, generally speaking, an imaginary line running through the middle of the stream is the boundary; just as if a road separates two properties, the ownership of the road belongs half-way to one and half-way to the other. It may be rebutted by circumstances, but if not rebutted, that is the legal presumption. Then if two properties are divided by a river, the boundary is an imaginary line in the middle of that river; but to say that the whole of the river is a sort of common property, which belongs to no one, is not a correct view of the case.\nIn Murphy vs. Ryan[80], O'Hagan, C. J, said:\u2014\nAccording to the well established principles of the common law, the proprietors on either side of a river are presumed to be possessed of the bed and soil of it moietively, to a supposed line in the middle, constituting their legal boundary; and, being so possessed, have an exclusive right to the fishery in? the water which flows above their respective territories, though the law secures to the community the right of navigation upon the surface of that water as a public highway, which individuals are forbidden to obstruct, and precludes the riparian proprietors from preventing the progress of the fish through the river, or dealing with the water to the injury of their neighbours.\n* * * * * *\nBut, whilst the rights of fishing in fresh water rivers, in which the soil belongs to the riparian owners, is thus exclusive, the right of fishing in the sea, and in its arms and estuaries, and in its tidal waters, wherever it ebbs and flows, is held by the common law to be publici juris, and to belong to all the subjects of the crown\u2014the soil of the sea and its arms and estuaries and tidal waters being vested in the sovereign as a trustee for the public. The exclusive right of fishing in the one case and the public right of fishing in the other depend upon the existence of a proprietorship in the soil of the private river by the private owner, and by the sovereign in the public river respectively.\n* * * * * *\nUpon a full consideration of all the cases, it will, I think, appear that no river has been ever held navigable, so as to vest in the Crown its bed and soil, and in the public the right of fishing, merely because it has been used as a general highway for the purpose of navigation; and that, beyond the point to which the sea ebbs and flows, even in a river so used for public purposes, the soil is prim\u00e2 facie in the riparian owners, and the right of fishing private.\n* * * * * *\nBut no usage can establish a right to take a profit in another's soil, which might involve the destruction of his property; and such a profit would be the taking of fish. The precise point is decided both as to the general law and the particular case of profit by fishing in Bland v. Lipscombe[81]; and the principle of that case, in affirmation of the ancient doctrine, is sustained by the judgments in Lloyd v. Jones[82]; Race v. Ward[83]; Hudson v. MacRea[84]; and other recent decisions. That principle is beyond controversy; and, therefore, the usage relied on in this defence cannot sustain the claim of the right in the public to fish in a river, the soil of which is not publici juris, but private property.\nIn Lyon v. Fishmonger Co.[85] Lord Cairns says:\nThe late Lord Wensleydale observed, in this House, in the case of Chasemore v. Richards[86] \"The subject of right to streams of water flowing on the surface has been of late years fully discussed, and by a series of carefully considered judgments placed upon a clear and satisfactory footing.\"\nAnd he then cites the language of the late Lord Wensleydale as quoted by O'Hagan.\nIn Marshall v. Ulleswater Steam Navigation Co.[87], it was held that \"the allegation of a several fishery, prim\u00e2 facie, imports ownership of the soil\"; per Wightman and Mellor, J. J., Cochrane, C. J., dissenting, but not holding the court (Q. B.) bound by the authorities to that effect.\nWightman, J., delivering judgment, referring to Rolford v. Bailey[88], says:\u2014\nThese decisions are in conformity with the rule stated in the late editions of Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. 2 p. 39. He that has a several fishery must also be (or at least derive his right from) the owner of the soil.\nCockburn, C. J., says:\u2014\nThe use of water for the purpose of fishing is, when the fishery is united with the ownership of the soil, a right incidental and accessory to the latter. On a grant of the land, the water and the incidental and accessory right of fishing would necessarily pass with it.\nPrevious to confederation many enactments were passed by the legislature of New Brunswick for the general regulation and protection of the fisheries in that province, but no act, I will undertake with confidence to assert, can be found in the statute books of New Brunswick, from the date of the erection of the province to the day of confederation, taking away or interfering with (except as such general regulations might interfere with) the private rights of the individual proprietors of lands through which such rivers run, still less to take from them the enjoyment of their rights of fishing and to authorize the leasing of the same to others to the exclusion of the owner. But the legislature did authorize the Grovernor-in-Council to grant leases or licenses for fishing purposes in rivers and streams above the tidal waters of such streams or rivers when the same belonged to the crown or the lands were ungranted, but the provincial legislature, having a just regard for private rights, specially provided that the rights of parties in lands and privileges already granted should not be affected thereby, recognizing the rights of individuals in the fisheries in rivers above tidal waters and the right of the province to the fisheries in rivers through the ungranted lands of the province. The reason why there was any legislation on this matter of leasing (for the executive government might have granted such leases without legislative authority) is to be found on the face of the act, viz., to regulate the sale and provide for the disposal of the proceeds, by enacting that such leases or licenses to be issued by the Governor in Council should be sold by public auction after 30 days' notice in the Royal Gazette, an upset price being determined by the Governor in Council, and that the rents and profits accruing from such leases or licenses should be paid into the provincial treasury to a separate account to be kept, called \"The Fishery Protection Account.\"\nSuch being the state of matters at the time of confederation, I am of opinion that the legislation in regard to \"Inland and Sea Fisheries\" contemplated by the British North America Act was not in reference to \"property and civil rights \"\u2014that is to say, not as to the ownership of the beds of the rivers, or of the fisheries, or the rights of individuals therein, but to subjects affecting the fisheries generally, tending to their regulation, protection and preservation, matters of a national and general concern and important to the public, such as the forbidding fish to be taken at improper seasons in an improper manner, or with destructive instruments, laws with reference to the improvement and increase of the fisheries; in other words, all such general laws as enure as well to the benefit of the owners of the fisheries as to the public at large, who are interested in the fisheries as a source of national or provincial wealth; in other words, laws in relation to the fisheries, such as those which the local legislatures were, previously to and at the time of confederation, in the habit of enacting for their regulation, preservation and protection, with which the property in the fish or the right to take the fish out of the water to be appropriated to the party so taking the fish has nothing whatever to do, the property in the fishing, or the right to take the fish, being as much the property of the province or the individual, as the dry land or the land covered with water. I cannot discover the slightest trace of an intention on the part of the Imperial Parliament to convey to the Dominion Government any property in the beds of streams or in the fisheries incident to the ownership thereof, whether belonging at the date of confederation either to the provinces or individuals, or to confer on the Dominion Parliament the right to appropriate or dispose of them, and receive therefor large rentals which most unequivocally proceed from property, or from the incidents of property in or to which the Dominion has no shadow of claim; but, on the contrary, I find all the property it was intended to vest in the Dominion specifically set forth. Nor can I discover the most remote indication of an intent to deprive either the provinces or the individuals of their proprietary rights in their respective properties; or in other words, that it was intended that the lands and their incidents should be separated and the lands continue to belong to the provinces and the crown grantees, and the incidental right of fishing should belong to the Dominion, or be at its disposal. I am at a loss to understand how the Dominion, which never owned the land, and therefore never had any right to the fishing as incidental to such ownership, without any grant, statutory or otherwise, without a word in the statute indicating the slightest intention to vest the rights of property or of fishing in the Dominion, without a word qualifying or limiting the right of property of the provinces in the public lands, can now successfully claim to have a beneficial interest in those fisheries, and authority to deal with such rights of fishing as the property of the Dominion, and claim to rent or license the same at large yearly rents and appropriate the proceeds to Dominion purposes, I had formerly occasion to point out that the public works and property of each province which it was intended should be the property of Canada were enumerated in the 3rd schedule, and that neither by express words nor by the most forced construction, could the slightest inference be drawn that the public lands of the provinces, or their incidents, were intended to be vested in the Dominion, and that the express words of section 117 as clearly and unequivocally established that the provinces were to retain all their respective public property not otherwise disposed of by the act, and that, as if to place the question beyond a per-adventure, section 109 provided that all lands, mines, &c., belonging to the several provinces of &c., and all sums then due and payable for such lands, mines, &c., should belong to the several provinces in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nI reiterate what I on a former occasion intimated, that at the time of the union the entire control, management and disposition of the crown lands, and the proceeds of the public domain, were confided to the executive administration of the provincial governments as representing the crown for the benefit of the provinces respectively, and to the legislative actions of the provincial legislatures, so that the crown lands, though standing in the name of the Queen, were, with their accessories and incidents, to all intents and purposes the public property of the respective provinces in which they were situate; and this property, the Imperial Act, by clear unambiguous language, has, as we have seen, declared shall after confederation continue to be the property of the provinces; and I cannot discover any intention to take from provincial legislatures all legislative power over property and civil rights in fisheries, such as we are now dealing with, and so give to the parliament of Canada the right to deprive the province or individuals of their right of property therein, and to transfer the same or the enjoyment thereof to others, as the license in question affects to do.\nTo all general laws passed by the Dominion of Canada regulating \"sea coast and inland fisheries\" all must submit, but such laws must not conflict or compete with the legislative power of the local legislatures over property and civil rights beyond what may be necessary for legislating generally and effectually for the regulation, protection and preservation of the fisheries in the interests of the public at large. Therefore, while the local legislatures have no right to pass any laws interfering with the regulation and protection of the fisheries, as they might have passed before confederation, they, in my opinion, clearly have a right to pass any laws affecting the property in those fisheries, or the transfer or transmission of such property under the power conferred on them to deal with property and civil rights in the province, inasmuch as such laws need have no connection or interference with the right of the Dominion parliament to deal with the regulation and protection of the fisheries, a matter wholly separate and distinct from the property in the fisheries. By which means the general jurisdiction over the fisheries is secured to the parliament of the Dominion, whereby they are enabled to pass all laws necessary for their preservation and protection, this being the only matter of general public interest in which the whole Dominion is interested in connection with river fisheries in fresh water, non-tidal rivers or streams, such as that now being considered, while at the same time exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights in such fisheries is preserved to the provincial legislatures, thus satisfactorily, to my mind, reconciling the powers of both legislatures without infringing on either.\nAs a necessary consequence of what I have said the Minister of Marine and Fisheries has no authority to issue a lease of the bed of such a river as this where it passes either through ungranted or granted lands, and I have an equally strong opinion that the Dominion parliament has no legislative power or authority to authorize him to issue, as against the owner, a license to fish as a franchise or right apart from the ownership of the soil, whether owned by the province or an individual. I am at a loss to conceive how it is possible for the minister to have that power over lands owned by the province and not have the same power over lands owned by private individuals; the franchise or right is in the private individual by virtue of his property in the bed of the stream, and this he obtains by virtue of the grant from the general government, why then should the province not have the same franchise or right by virtue of its property in the soil, bank and bed of the river?\nUnquestionably the right of fishing may be in one person and the property in the bank and soil of a river in another, but can there be a doubt that if a man owning land on the bank of a river, with right to the bed of the river extending to the centre of a stream opposite such land, conveys without reservation or exception the land bounded by the stream, that the right of fishing goes with it? But what is there in the British North America Act to give the slightest countenance to the idea that any such separation of the right to lands and to the fishery incidental to the land was contemplated, and that while the public lands were retained to the provinces, rights of fishing connected therewith and incident thereto were to become separate and distinct, the one from the other, and the fishing taken from the provinces and transferred to the Dominion?\nCan it be disputed that, under the 109th section, the banks and beds of all such ungranted rivers and streams belong to the several provinces? Where then do we get any language severing the right to the fisheries from the property or title to the soil or bed of these rivers, or altering in any way the title or ownership of the lands, including the banks and beds of rivers passing through them, or any of the rights incident to the same?\nI think Mr. Justice Fisher in Steadman v. Robertson[89], took a correct view of the law. I have arrived at like conclusions, viz: that it was not the intention of the The British North America Act, 1867, to give the parliament of Canada any greater power than had been previously exercised by the separate legislatures of the provinces; that is the general power for the regulation and protection of the fisheries; that the act of the parliament of Canada, 31 Vic., c. 60, recognises that view, and while it provides for the regulation and protection of the fisheries, it does not interfere with existing exclusive rights of fishing, whether provincial or private, but only authorizes the granting of leases where the property and therefore the right of fishing thereto belongs to the Dominion, or where such rights do not already exist by law; that the exclusive right of fishing in rivers such as the Miramichi at Price's Bend and from thence to its source, as described in the case, exist by law in the provincial government of New Brunswick or its grantees; that any lease granted by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, to fish in such fresh water non-tidal rivers, which are not the property of the Dominion, or in which the soil is not in the Dominion, is illegal; that where the exclusive right to fish has been acquired as incident to a grant of the land through which such river flows, there is no authority given by the Canadian act to grant a right to fish, and the Dominion parliament has no right to give such authority; and also that the ungranted lands in the province of New Brunswick, being in the crown for the benefit of the people of New Brunswick, the exclusive right to fish follows as an incident, and is in the crown as trustee for the benefit of the people of the province, exclusively, and therefore a license by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to fish in streams running through provincial property or private lands is illegal, and consequently the lease or license issued to the suppliant is null and void.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe fishery license granted to the respondent contains no covenant for title or warranty on the part of the Crown, and, therefore, upon no principle of law which has been suggested, or that I can discover, could the Crown be made liable to indemnify the respondent in the case of eviction. In my opinion the appeal ought to be decided upon this ground, for I do not think the court ought to entertain the special case upon the submission of the Attorney General for the Crown to indemnify the respondent, if the Court should be of opinion against the Crown on what, so far as the interest of the respondent is concerned, is a purely speculative question stated for the opinion of the Court. In the case of private suitors, if a special case appears to be framed for the purpose of eliciting an opinion upon a question, the decision of which is not essential to determine the rights of the parties, the court will refuse to entertain it[90], and I see no reason why the same rule should not be applied to a case in which the Crown is a party. As the case is presented to the court it appears that the officers of the Crown have arranged to pay the suppliant, not damages, but a gratuity, in the event of the court being of the opinion that the Crown had no authority to grant the license in question. This is to invoke an advisory not a contentious jurisdiction, and such a jurisdiction ought not to be exercised unless conferred by statute, which has not been done.\nAs, however, the other members of the court take a different view on this point, I yield to their judgment, and proceed to express the opinion at which I have arrived on the points which have been argued.\nThus dealing with the case, I think the appeal should be dismissed, but although I arrive at this conclusion, I am not prepared to coincide in all the reasons stated in the judgment delivered in the court below.\nI have no difficulty in agreeing in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, so far as it determines that by the true construction of the exception contained in the letters patent of the 5th November, 1835, by which the Crown granted the lands bordering on the river Miramichi, including the limits to which the respondents licence extended, that exception did not comprise the whole bed of the river Miramichi, but only so much of it as adjoined lands which the Crown had previously granted, and which lands are also excepted from the operation of the grant.\nThe exception in question is thus expressed:\nAnd also further excepting the bed and waters of the Miramichi river and the beds and waters of all the rivers and streams which empty themselves into the St. John or the river Nashwaack so far up the said rivers and streams respectively as the same respectively pass through or over any of the said heretofore previously granted pieces or parcels of land hereinbefore excepted.\nI cannot conceive what language could have been adopted more plainly expressing an intention to except the portions of the bed adjacent to lands already granted and such portions only. The object of the Crown clearly was to protect the rights of its earlier grantees, an object which would be equally applicable to grantees of lands lying on the Miramichi, as to those of lands on the other rivers named. Therefore whilst, on the one hand, neither the words of the instrument itself, nor the plain reason of thus restricting its operation, call for the construction contended for by the Crown, that the whole bed of the Miramichi was reserved, on the other hand, there is nothing to give the slightest colour to the argument said to have been advanced in the court below on behalf of the respondent, that the exception itself did not apply for the Miramichi but only to the other rivers. Indeed, before this court, neither of the learned counsel who argued the case for the Crown and the respondent urged these contentions.\nThen, it does not appear, from the statements of the case, that any portion of the bed of the river comprised in the fishery limits granted by the license, viz.: from Price's Bend to its source, had been granted at a date earlier than that of the letters patent to the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Company. The question next arises what, upon this construction and the state of facts just mentioned, was the effect of the grant upon the property in the bed of the river, did it pass under the grant to the land company, or was it reserved to the Crown?\nThe river Miramichi, between the two points indicated, Price's Bend and the source, is, upon the facts admitted in the case, beyond all question not a navigable or public river.\nThe navigable capacity of this portion of the river is thus described in the case:\nThat portion of the Miramichi river which is covered by fishery lease to suppliant is above tidal waters, and is navigable for canoes and boats, and has been used from the earliest settlement of the country as a highway for the same, and for the purpose of floating down timber and logs to market. After the St. John, the largest river in New Brunswick is the Miramichi, flowing northward into an extensive bay of its own name. It is 225 miles in length and seven miles wide at its mouth. It is navigable for large vessels 25 miles from the gulf, and for schooners 25 miles further to the head of the tide, above which, for 60 miles, it is navigable for row boats. The river has many large tributaries extending over a great extent of country. Price's Bend is about 40 or 45 miles above the ebb and flow of the tide. The stream for the greater part from this point upward is navigable for canoes, small boats, flat bottomed scows, logs and timber. Logs are usually floated down the river in high water, in the spring and fall. The stream is rapid. During summer it is in some places on the bars very shallow. In the salmon fishing, say June, July and August, canoes have to be hauled over the very shallow bars by hand.\nThis description is that of a river non navigable, and consequently what is called a private river as regards that portion of it above Price's Bend. Whilst I do not hesitate to say that the rule which appears to have been adopted as a principle of the common law as administered in England, that no rivers are to be considered in law as public and navigable above the ebb and flow of the tide, is not applicable to the great rivers of this continent, as has been determined by the Supreme Court of the United States and by the courts of most of the States, and whilst I think that with us the sole test of the navigable and public character of such streams is their capacity for such uses, I am still not prepared to accede to the argument of Mr. Lash that a river navigable in any part of its course is to be considered in law as navigable from its source. No authority can be produced for such a proposition, and the books are full of instances in which rivers navigable and public in their lower course have been held to be private and non-navigable in the upper part of the stream In the case of Murphy v. Ryan[91], we have indeed an instance in which this was expressly determined to be the case. Then, the admitted statement contained in the case shews beyond all ground of cavil that in point of fact the portion of the river Miramichi in question is not in fact navigable, for, to say that a stream in which the most lightly constructed vessels used upon our waters require to be hauled over shallows and bars is a navigable river, would be a contradiction in terms and calls for no observation.\nThen, no principle of law can be better established both in England and America than the rule which ascribes the ownership of the soil and bed of a non-navigable river prim\u00e2 facie to riparian proprietors of the opposite banks, each to the middle thread of the stream. To cite authorities for this universally recognized principle would be a useless waste of time. It is true that this is but a prim\u00e2 facie presumption, but, this being so, in the present case there is not only nothing to rebut the presumption, but, on the contrary, it is greatly strengthened and made almost conclusive by the exception before adverted to, contained in the letters patent, reserving the soil or bed appurtenant to the lands of riparian owners holding under former grants from the Crown.\nIt results from the proprietorship of the riparian owner of the soil in the bed of the river that he has the exclusive right of fishing in so much of the bed of the river as belongs to him, and this is not a riparian right in the nature of an easement, but is strictly a right of property. To sustain these propositions of law authorities without number might be cited, it is sufficient for the present purpose to refer to two or three of the most weighty and apposite. Sir Matthew Hale says in the Treatise de Jure Maris:\nFresh rivers of what kind soever do of common right belong to the owners of the soil adjacent, so that the owners of one side have of common right the property of the soil, and consequently the right of fishing usque filum aqu\u00e6, and the owners on the other side the right of soil or ownership and fishing unto the filum aqu\u00e6 on their side. And if a man be owner of the land of both sides, in common presumption he is owner of the whole river, and hath the right of fishing according to the extent of his land in length; with this agrees common experience.\nChancellor Kent in his commentaries[92] states the law as follows:\nBut grants of land bounded on rivers or upon the margins of the same, or along the same above tide-water, carry the exclusive right and title of the grantee to the centre of the stream, unless the terms of the grant clearly denote the intention to stop at the edge or margin of the river; and the public, in the case where the river is navigable for boats and rafts, have an easement thereon or a right of passage subject to the jus publicum as a common public highway.\nI may say in passing that, although Chancellor Kent undoubtedly states the law as determined both by the older and more recent authorities applicable to private rivers such as the present, it may be doubted whether his doctrine is equally applicable to large navigable fresh water rivers, above the flow of the tide, not only where such rivers form international boundaries, as in the instance of the St Lawrence, but in cases where their whole course is comprised within the same State or Province. Recent decisions in the learned Chancellor's own State (New York) seem to indicate that the beds of such large navigable rivers are, by the common law, vested in the State as a trustee for the public, and are inalienable without legislative authority, and do not therefore pass ad medium filum aquae to the riparian owners, and that the right of fishing in such rivers is public, as in the sea and the other large inland lakes of this continent. It is unnecessary for the purpose of the present case to decide this question, and I have only alluded to it to prevent any misapprehension hereafter, should the point itself arise for decision. It is sufficient for the present purpose that the passage from the commentaries applies to non-navigable rivers, and gives us the law governing such streams as those we are now dealing with. To the authorities on this head already quoted, may be added that of Lord O'Hagan, lately Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who, when a Judge of the Irish Court of Common Pleas, in giving judgment in the case of Murphy v. Ryan, already referred to, thus distinctly affirms the doctrine of Sir Matthew Hale; he says:\nAccording to the well established principles of the common law the proprietors on either side of the river are presumed to be possessed of the bed and soil of it moietively to a supposed line in the middle, constituting the legal boundary, and being so possessed have an exclusive right to the fishery in the water which flows along their respective territories.\nFrom a treatise on the law of waters lately published by Messrs. Goulson & Forbes, I extract the following passage:\nIn all rivers and streams above the flow and re flow of the tide, whether such rivers are navigable or not, the proprietors of the land abutting on the streams are prim\u00e2 facie the owners of the soil of the alveus or channel ad medium filum aqu\u00e6, and as such have prim\u00e2 facie the right of fishing in front of their own lands. This right is a right of property, one of the profits of the land, and has been called a territorial fishery. It is not strictly speaking a riparian right arising from the right of access to the water, but is a profit of the land over which the water flows, and as such may be transferred or appropriated, either with or without the property in the bed or banks, to another person, whether he has land or not on the borders of or adjacent to the stream[93].\nApplying the law as thus stated to the facts stated in the special case submitted for the opinion of the court, we must determine that at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, the soil or bed of the river Miramichi between Price's Bend and its source was vested in the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia land company, or its grantees, to whom consequently also belonged, and that as a right of property, and not as an easement or franchise, the absolute and exclusive right of fishing within the same limits.\nThe question next presents itself, did the British North America Act either directly affect these vested rights of property, or did it authorize Parliament to interfere with them by legislation? There is no pretence for saying that the Act contains anything in the slightest degree derogating from the rights of fishing belonging to the proprietors of the beds of non-navigable rivers. By the 13th enumeration of the 92nd section the exclusive right to legislate concerning property is conferred upon the Local Legislatures, to whom also by the 16th sub-sec. are granted similar powers concerning matters of a local and private nature. Thse provisions must necessarily exclude the right of the Parliament of the Dominion to legislate to the prejudice of the rights of fishing vested in the proprietors of beds of rivers and streams, unless we can find in section 91, defining the powers of Parliament, some exception to the general effect of the word \"property\" as including such a proprietary right. The only words in the last mentioned section which it can be suggested may have such an operation are those of the 12th enumeration \"Sea coast and inland fisheries.\" It is a sound and well recognized maxim of construction that in the interpretation of statutes we are to assume nothing calculated to impair private rights of ownership, unless compelled to do so by express words or necessary implication. This principle has within the last few months been applied with much approval by the Privy Council, in the case of the Western Counties Railway Co. v. The Windsor & Annapolis Railway Co., and is too well fixed as a canon of construction to be open to the least doubt or question. As observed in the judgment of the Privy Council in the case just mentioned, the only difficulty which ever arises respecting it is in its application to particular enactments. I think there is room for applying an analogous principle in the present case. Although the provision in question does not in itself make any disposition of the fisheries mentioned, but is merely facultative, empowering Parliament to make laws respecting the subjects named, we are not to assume, without express words or unavoidable implication, that it was the intention of the Imperial legislature to confer upon parliament the power to encroach upon private and local rights of property which by other sections of the Act have been especially confided to the protection and disposition of another legislature. I am of opinion, therefore, that the thirteenth enumeration of section 91, by the single expression \"Inland Fisheries,\" conferred upon parliament no power of taking away exclusive rights of fishery vested in the private proprietors of non-navigable rivers, and that such exclusive rights, being in every sense of the word \"property,\" can only be interfered with by the provincial legislatures in exercise of the powers given them by the provision of section 92 before referred to. This does not by any means leave the sub-clause referred to in section 91 without effect, for it may well be considered as authorizing parliament to pass laws for the regulation and conservation of all fisheries, inland as well as sea coast, by enacting, for instance, that fish shall not be taken during particular seasons, in order that protection may be afforded whilst breeding, prohibiting obstructions in ascending rivers from the sea; preventing the undue destruction of fish by taking them in a particular manner or with forbidden engines, and in many other ways providing for what may be called the police of the fisheries. Again, under this provision parliament may enact laws for regulating and restricting the right of fishing in the waters belonging to the Dominion, such as public harbors, the beds of which have been lately determined by this court to be vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion, and also for regulating the public inland fisheries of the Dominion, such as those of the great lakes and possibly also those of navigable non-tidal rivers. There is therefore no unreasonable restriction of the power of parliament in construing the twelfth sub-section as I do, as not including a power to legislate concerning the right of property in private fisheries.\nI am so far of accord with the learned judge whose judgment is the subject of appeal. I am compelled, however, to differ from him when he makes a difference between the rights of private owners which had been acquired by grant from the Crown before Confederation and the rights of the provincial governments in respect of fisheries in non-navigable rivers, the beds of which, not having been granted, were vested in the provinces at that date. I can see no reason for such a distinction. By the British North America Act, the Crown Lands are vested in the respective provinces. This of course\" includes the beds of all non-navigable rivers and the consequent right to the fish in such waters, for there can be no doubt that the right of taking fish in rivers of this class, so long as they remain ungranted, is vested in the Provinces as an incident of the ownership of the public domain, just as the timber and all the other profits of the land are so vested. These fisheries, although often in practice not conserved by the Provinces, are certainly not public fisheries open of common right to all who may choose to avail themselves of them, as is the case with regard to the fisheries in tidal waters and the great lakes, but the provincial governments may, without special legislation and in exercise of their right of property, restrict their use in any manner which may seem expedient just as freely as private owners might do. In short, the public have no more right in law to take fish in non-navigable rivers belonging to the provinces than they have to fell and carry away trees growing on the public lands; in the one instance, as in the other, such interferences with provincial rights of property are neither more nor less than illegal acts of trespass.\nThis being so, it seems very clear to me that no well-founded distinction, as regards the power of legislation by parliament, can be made between fisheries in rivers which, at the date of Confederation, were the property of private owners under grants from the Crown and those which remain the property of the provinces as part of the public domain. In both cases the right of fishing is a profit of the land, an incident of the proprietary right in the soil, and is as much property in the hands of the province as in that of a private owner. Then, if the British North America Act contains nothing warranting federal legislative interference with this right of property in the case of a private owner, how can it be asserted that it does so when the ownership is vested in the province? The Crown lands are expressly assured to the provinces, and these include the beds of all such streams as that now in question. Where it was intended to make an exception to the general terms of the 109th sec. of the Act, as in the case of property reserved to Canada by the 108th sec., and the power to assume lands or public property for the purposes of defence, conferred by the 117th sec., we find such exceptions expressed in clear and distinct enactments. How, then, can it be presumed, in view, not only of the 109th sec., but also of the 5th enumeration of sec 92, giving the provinces exclusive legislative powers respecting the public lands, and that as to property generally in sub-sec. 13 of sec 92, that the Dominion has the power to legislate respecting these fisheries incidental to the ownership of the provincial lands, or respecting any other dismemberment of the right of property in such lands, if it is not conferred by the clause in see. 91 respecting sea coast and inland fisheries? Not a single provision of the British North America Act can be pointed to as conferring such powers of legislation, except that just mentioned, which, for the reasons already given in considering the case of private owners, must be held inapplicable.\nI therefore come to a different conclusion in this respect from that arrived at in the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nThere are, of course, fisheries of a very different character from those in non-navigable waters to be found within the limits of all the provinces\u2014public fisheries, such as those in tidal rivers and in the great lakes of the western provinces. A question may arise whether the provisions contained in sec. 91 authorizes parliament to empower the Crown to grant exclusive rights in respect of such fisheries. Upon this point it would not be proper now to express any opinion since none has been raised for adjudication: The same may also be said of an important question which may hereafter be presented for decision as to the right to legislate so as to authorize exclusive rights in respect of fisheries in what have been called by Chancellor Kent, the \"great rivers,\" meaning large navigable non-tidal rivers, a question the solution of which must depend on whether the beds of such rivers are vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion, not as part of its domain, but as trustees for the public, or in the owners of the adjacent lands, inasmuch as the right of fishing would in the first case be in the public as of common right, but in the second vested in the riparian proprietors.\nThese are questions the discussion of which would not be appropriate in the present case, and I refer to them only to point out that what I have said, as to rivers of the class to which the portion of the Miramichi now in question belongs, has no reference either to navigable fresh water rivers or to the great lakes.\nI consider that I shall sufficiently answer the different questions propounded for the decision of this court by stating my opinion that the Crown had no power to grant the license in question, and that the same is absolutely void; and further, that the Crown has no power under the statute of 1868 to grant an exclusive right of fishing in any non-navigable river, whether the bed or soil of such river be vested in the Crown in right of the Province, or in a private owner deriving title under a grant from the Crown made either before or since the passing of the British North America Act.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nApr\u00e8s les savantes dissertations que l'on vient d'entendre sur l'importante question soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette cour, il serait inutile pour moi de revenir sur les faits de la cause, et de discuter longuement de nouveau les questions de droit qu'elle pr\u00e9sente. Mais comme la question de juridiction, entre le pouvoir local et le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, soul\u00e8ve encore ici la question de savoir jusqu'\u00e0 quel point le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral exer\u00e7ant son pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif sur un sujet de sa comp\u00e9tence peut affecter les droits particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux provinces, et plus sp\u00e9cialement les droits civils, je crois devoir r\u00e9it\u00e9rer l'expression de mon opinion \u00e0 ce sujet. Me fondant sur l'opinion des plus hautes autorit\u00e9s judiciaires des Etats-Unis, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9cider des questions analogues, sur la juridiction et les droits respectifs des Etats et du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l'Union am\u00e9ricaine, j'ai adopt\u00e9, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, leur opinion qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible d'\u00e9tablir une r\u00e8gle uniforme d'interpr\u00e9tation pouvant servir \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de toutes les questions de conflit de ce genre. Cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi exprim\u00e9e plusieurs fois depuis par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9. Cushing v. Dupuy[94] Parsons v. The Citizen's Ins. Co.[95] d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en novembre dernier.\nDans une cause assez r\u00e9cente, j'ai eu occasion de dire, et je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, 'que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a, sans doute, le pouvoir de toucher incidemment \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res qui sont de la juridiction des provinces. Mais dans mon opinion, ce pouvoir ne s'\u00e9tend pas au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation ayant uniquement pour but le l\u00e9gitime exercice d'un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cette r\u00e8gle, pas plus qu'aucune autre, ne peut \u00eatre d'une application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Toutefois, appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la question actuelle, je crois qu'il est facile de concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats respectifs des deux gouvernements. La section 91, sous-section 12 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, en donnant au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur les p\u00eacheries, ne lui en attribue pas le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne les enl\u00e8ve pas des propri\u00e9taires ou possesseurs d'alors pour se les approprier. Ce n'est pas ainsi non plus que cette section a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'acte 31 Vic., ch. 60, pass\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu de temps apr\u00e8s l'acte de conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. La sec. 2 d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que le \"ministre de la Marine et des P\u00eacheries pourra, \"lorsque le droit exclusif de p\u00eacher n'existe pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 en \"vertu de la loi, \u00e9mettre ou autoriser l'\u00e9mission de baux \"ou licences de p\u00eache pour p\u00eacher en tout endroit o\u00f9 \"se fait la p\u00eache.\" Comme on le voit les droits de tous ceux qui avaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat ou une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les p\u00eacheries sont respect\u00e9s. Sous le rapport du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 l'acte f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, ni l'acte des p\u00eacheries n'ont fait de changement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de choses existant avant la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est demeur\u00e9e o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait auparavant. Il n'y a donc sous ce rapport aucun empi\u00e8tement de la part du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Si l'action du d\u00e9partement de la Marine n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conforme \u00e0 ce principe, comme dans le cas actuel, cette action est nulle. Tout en respectant le droit de p\u00eache comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9 le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut-il pas y exercer, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Puissance, un droit de surveillance et de protection? Je crois que oui, et que c'est l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le but des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet. Il n'y a, suivant moi, aucune incompatibilit\u00e9 entre l'exercice de ce pouvoir avec l'exercice du droit de p\u00eache, comme droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en d'autres mains que ceux du gouvernement. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral peut, suivant moi, dire au propri\u00e9taire: \"Vous ne p\u00eacherez qu'en certaines saisons et qu'avec certains instruments ou engins de p\u00eache autoris\u00e9s.\" Cette restriction n'est pas une atteinte, mais bien plut\u00f4t une restriction accord\u00e9e \u00e0 ce genre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est une r\u00e9glementation, je dirai, de police et de contr\u00f4le sur un genre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il est important de d\u00e9velopper et de conserver pour l'avantage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. On sait ce que deviendrait en peu de temps les p\u00eacheries, s'il \u00e9tait libre aux particuliers de les exploiter comme bon leur semblerait. En peu d'ann\u00e9es, leur aveugle avidit\u00e9 aurait bient\u00f4t ruin\u00e9 ces sources de richesses\u2014et nos p\u00eacheries, au lieu de revenir aussi riches et aussi f\u00e9condes qu'autrefois, retourneraient bient\u00f4t \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9p\u00e9rissement, sinon de ruine, o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une l\u00e9gislation protectrice. Ce pouvoir de r\u00e9gl\u00e9mentation, de surveillance et de protection a \u00e9t\u00e9, avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, exerc\u00e9 par chaque province dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. C'est le m\u00eame pouvoir qu'exerce aujourd'hui le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Pas plus que les provinces ne l'ont fait, il n'a le pouvoir de toucher au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les p\u00eacheries, son pouvoir se borne \u00e0 en r\u00e9gler l'exercice.\nA l'endroit particulier auquel s'appliquent le bail et la licence, dont la validit\u00e9 est attaqu\u00e9e, la rivi\u00e8re Miramichi n'est pas navigable; elle n'est que flottable d'apr\u00e8s l'admission de faits qui tient lieu de preuve en cette cause. C'est pour cette raison que je m'abstiendrai de faire aucune observation sur plusieurs autres questions importantes, savamment discut\u00e9es dans le jugement de l'honorable juge Gwynne, concernant le droit de p\u00eache dans les eaux navigables. Il me suffit de d\u00e9clarer, pour les fins de cette cause, que je suis d'avis avec l'honorable juge en chef que le droit de p\u00eache dans les eaux non-navigables est un attribut de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 riveraine,\u2014que ce soit une province ou un particulier qui soit propri\u00e9taire,\u2014sujet, toutefois, au droit du public de faire usage de ces rivi\u00e8res non navigables comme voies de communication, autant que leur nature le permet. Je suis encore d'opinion avec l'honorable juge en chef, que l'exercice du droit de p\u00eache dans ces m\u00eames rivi\u00e8res est soumis au pouvoir r\u00e9gl\u00e9mentaire du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sujet des p\u00eacheries. HENRY, J.:\u2014\nAfter a full consideration of the issues before us I think the appeal in this case should be dismissed. The British North America Act of 1867 conveys to the Dominion no property in the sites of the sea coast or inland fisheries, as I construe it. In section 91, which defines the powers of the Dominion Parliament, we find included \"Sea coast and inland fisheries.\" That provision in the enumeration of the powers enables the Parliament of the Dominion to legislate on the subject, as it does in respect to matters such as \"Shipping and navigation,\" \"Ferries,\" \"Bills of exchange and promissory notes\" and many others, without passing any right of property in the several subject-matters. In fact, in my opinion the power under the Act is but to regulate the fisheries and to sustain and protect them by grants of money and otherwise as might be considered expedient.\nIndependently of the Imperial statute the Dominion Parliament has no power to legislate in respect of property or civil rights in the Province, and could not otherwise by enactment affect the tenure of or title to real property. By the common law the owner of the soil has the right of fishery in unnavigable streams and water courses. That right, to be taken away, restrained, or transferred must be by a Parliament having jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and to possess and exercise the power to interfere with and control private property and interests there must have been an express grant of that power in the Imperial Act. I have searched in vain for such, or even anything that would suggest the conclusion that such was intended. I am therefore of the opinion that the leases granted by the several Ministers of Marine and Fisheries, so far as they cover private property or affect private rights, are wholly irregular and void. The same principles are applicable where lands are under the control of and owned by the Local Governments in trust for the use of the people of the several Provinces.\nI think, therefore, that by force of the agreement under which this case is prosecuted the Respondent is entitled to our judgment. As the learned Chief Justice had prepared a judgment which embraces my views upon the leading points in the case, I have not thought it necessary to put my judgment in writing.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that, as an exclusive right of fishing existed in the part of the Miramichi River in question, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries could not legally grant a license to fish for that portion of the said river.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nAttorney for respondent: R.

Ritchie, Knight, C. J., and Strong Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nFalse imprisonment\u2014Arrest\u2014Assessment\u201441 Vic., ch. 9, K.B.\u2014Execution issued by Receiver of taxes for City of St. John\u2014\"Respondeat superior.\"\nThe 41 Vic., ch. 9, entituled \"An Act to widen and extend certain public streets in the city of St. John\" authorized commissioners appointed by the Governor in Council to assess the owners of the land who would be benefited by the widening of the streets, and in their report on the extension of Canterbury street, the commissioners so appointed assessed the benefit to a certain lot at $419.46, and put in their report the name of the appellant (McS.) as the owner. The amount so assessed was to be paid to the corporation of the city, and, if not, it was the duty of the receiver of taxes, appointed by the city corporation, to issue execution and levy the same. McS, although assessed, was not the owner of the lot. S., the receiver of taxes, in default, issued an execution, and for want of goods McS, was arrested and imprisoned, until he paid the amount at the Chamberlain's office in the city of St. John. The action was for arrest and false imprisonment, and for money had and received. The jury found a verdict for McS. on the first count against both defendants.\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick), that S., who issued the warrant, founded upon a void assessment and caused the arrest to be made, was guilty of a trespass, and being at the time a servant of the corporation, under their control and specially appointed by them to collect and levy the amount so assessed, the maxim of respondeat superior applied, and therefore the verdict in favor of McS. for $635.39 against both respondents on the first count should stand. (Ritchie, C. J., and Taschereau, J., dissenting.)\nPer Gwynne, J.: That the corporation had adopted the act of their officer as their own by receiving and retaining the money paid and authorizing McS.'s discharge from custody only after such payment.\nThis was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick[1], whereby it was ordered that the verdict entered for the plaintiff at the trial of this cause be set aside and a new trial granted. The facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., for appellant:\nIt is clear a gross injustice has been done to the appellant; he has been compelled to pay under duress a large amount of money, which has come into the hands of the respondents, which he had no right to pay.\nThe jurisdiction of the commissioners was only a limited authority; they could only assess certain parties, or rather, a certain class, of which the appellant was not one. They had no jurisdiction over the appellant; he was not an owner, proprietor, lessee, or a party or person in any way interested, legally or equitably, in any lands or premises benefited by the widening and extension of the said street, and therefore a person over whom the commissioners could not exercise any jurisdiction or power.\nThey could not, by inserting the appellant's name in the report, or in the plan, give to themselves jurisdiction.\nThe report was only final and conclusive on an owner, etc., and the provisions of the eleventh section apply only to cases where the objector disputes the amount and correctness of the assessment, but not his liability to pay. Hesketh v. Local Board of Atherton[2].\nTaxing acts must be construed strictly[3]. The chamberlain of the city was bound to see that the assessment against the appellant was properly made before he issued his execution. Where there is no jurisdiction the whole matter is void ab initio. Burroughs on Taxation[4].\nI contend also that the execution in this case against the defendant was issued without lawful authority, even assuming the appellant liable to assessment, upon two grounds.\n1st. That no proper demand was made on the appellant.\nBy the 14th section the parties liable were to pay on demand \"to such person or persons as the said mayor, alderman and commonalty of the city of St. John shall appoint to receive the same.\"\nBy the evidence of Mr. Peters, the common clerk, page 13 of case, the respondent, William Sandall, was appointed to demand and receive the amount\nNow the evidence shows that William Sandall made no demand. He could not delegate his authority to Frederick Sandall. When appointed, a statutory power was given to him, or to be exercised by him, and, being an official act rendering the party upon whom the demand was made liable both in person and property, he could not authorize another person to do that act. He was the agent of the other respondents, and alone was authorized to receive the amount. Frederick Sandall had no right to receive it.\n2nd. The respondent Sandall was not authorized to issue an execution except upon the terms under which assessments are levied under the Assessment Acts of St. John. By those acts there must be some evidence of a demand or notice. Here there was none properly shown.\nIn the special plea, it is alleged that the said William Sandall made the demand. This is a necessary averment, and is put in issue by the replication.\nThe receiver of taxes is the officer of the city, appointed and paid by the city, and their authorized agent to receive their moneys. Payment to him is payment to the other respondents, and he held it subject to their order, and they have adopted his act.\nDr. Tuck, Q.C., for respondents:\nNeither the city nor the chamberlain were responsible for the legality of the assessment, the chamberlain only did that which the statute ordered him to do. The appellant's name being down on the list, the chamberlain could not act otherwise. It may, in the ordinary sense, seem hard that a person, not an owner, and having no interest in the lands on the line of Canterbury street, should be assessed and compelled to pay. But if any wrong has been done in this case, it was the fault of the commissioners, and not of the defendants, or either of them. It cannot be contended that the commissioners who were appointed by the Governor in Council were the officers of the corporation, and, if it is their fault, the maxim of respondeat superior cannot apply. Besides, it is pretty clear, as regards the plaintiff, that no wrong was done him, for he knew as early as the sixteenth of March, 1878, that he had been assessed, the land upon which the assessment had been made, and that, if the land was not registered in his own name, yet he knew all about it, and that, whilst the legal title was in his son, the property really belonged to himself.\nThe only count upon which the corporation could be held liable is on the money count, and the jury found for the city on that count. Mr. Weldon, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was an action commenced in the month of October, in the year 1878, for a wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, upon an execution issued by the defendant, William Sandall, Receiver of Taxes of the city of Saint John, on the fifth day of September, A. D., 1878, against the plaintiff. The declaration contains a count for false imprisonment, and also, by leave of a judge, a count for money had and received, and for interest.\nTo the first count of this declaration the defendants plead \"not guilty;\" and for a second plea to the same count they justify under an execution issued by the defendant, William Sandall, Receiver of Taxes of the city of Saint John\nTo the second and third counts the defendants plead \"never indebted.\"\nThe plaintiff joins issue on the defendant's first, third, and fourth pleas; and to the second he replies specially, setting forth that he is not the owner of the land and premises in question.\nEverything turns upon the second plea and the replication thereto.\nThe 41 Vic., c. 9 authorizes the extension of Canterbury Street. Section 2 provides for the appointment by the Governor in Council of \"three or more discreet and disinterested persons commissioners for the purpose of extending Canterbury street (from etc. to etc.) and for performing the duties in the said act in that respect mentioned and prescribed.\" Section 3 requires the commissioners to be sworn \"faithfully to perform the trusts and duties severally required of them by the said act.\" Section 7 provides how Canterbury street shall be extended, and its width. Section 8 declares it to be the duty of the commissioners to cause plans and surveys of the streets to be widened or extended and the several lots of land fronting on them respectively, to be made by the city engineer, and for that purpose power is given to the commissioners to enter upon the lands upon or near the said streets. Section 9, \"as soon as plans are made the commissioners are to make a just and equitable estimate of the value of the lands, &c., required for widening and extending the streets, and to assess and apportion the amount of such estimated value,\" that is to say, for the extension of Canterbury street the Commissioners shall assess and apportion the whole estimated value of the lands, etc., required and taken for the extension and opening of said street upon the parties owning or interested in any lands etc., along the line of such extension, and in the discretion and opinion of the Commissioners benefited thereby in proportion to the benefit accruing to such parties respectively.\nSection 10 requires the commissioners immediately upon completing any such estimate, assessment and apportionment, to file with the common clerk of the city, the said plan as and for a record of their doings in that respect, and shall forthwith report their proceedings and all matters and things connected with their duties as such commissioners to the common council of the city, and in said report shall set forth the names of the respective owners, lessees, parties and persons entitled unto or interested in such lands, etc., as far forth as the same shall be ascertained by them, and an apt and sufficient description of the land required for extending the street and also of the lots fronting on the street assessed for said benefit, also the sums estimated and assessed for compensation to be made for land taken, and also sums assessed upon same for the benefit of the owners in fee or for compensation, and for the assessment for the benefit of the owners of the leasehold estate or other interest separately, but in every case \"where the owners and parties interested or their respective estates and interests are unknown or not fully known to the commissioners, it shall be sufficient for them to estimate and assess and to set forth in their report in general terms the respective sums to be allowed and paid to or by the owners generally and parties interested therein in respect of the whole estate and interest of whomsoever may be entitled to or interested in said lands without specifying the names or estates or interest of such owners and parties interested, and upon the coming in and filing of such report the same shall be final and conclusive as well upon the mayor, &c., of the city as upon the owners, lessees, parties or persons interested in and entitled, mentioned in said report, and the mayor, etc., shall be possessed of the lands so required for extending the street to be appropriated, converted and used for such purpose and none other, and the mayor, etc., may take possession without suit.\nBy section 11 the commissioners, after completing estimates and assessments, and fourteen days before making the report to the common council, shall deposit a true copy of such estimate and assessment in the office of the common clerk for the inspection of whom it may concern, and give notice in two newspapers of such deposit, and of the day on which it will be finally filed, as and for a record of their proceedings; and any persons whose rights may be affected thereby, or who shall object to the same or any part thereof, may, within ten days after first publication, state their objections in writing to the commissioners, and the commissioners shall reconsider their estimate or assessment, or part objected to, and in case the same shall appear to them to require correction, but not otherwise, shall and may correct the same, but if they adhere to their original opinion and notify the party objecting, then the party interested objecting may nominate by writing, within five days, one arbitrator, the commissioners another, and the two a third, who shall arbitrate and determine the question, provided the award shall be filed in the office of the common clerk within ten days, and then the commissioners shall correct the estimated assesment agreeably to the award.\nSection 12 requires the mayor, etc., within one month after assessment collected and received by them, to pay parties mentioned in report the sums estimated and reported in their favor, deducting any amount they may be declared liable to pay by reason of benefit, and in default, parties, after application first made, may sue the corporation, and the act, and the report of the commissioners, and proof of the right and title of the plaintiff to the sum demanded, shall be conclusive evidence in such suit.\nProvision is made that sums reported to infants, persons non compos mentis, feme covert, or absent, or where the names are not set forth in the report, or where owners, after diligent enquiry, cannot be found, that the mayor, etc. may pay the sums mentioned in said report, into the equity side of the Supreme Court, and every such payment shall be a complete discharge of, and for, any liability under the act, and the report of the commissioners in the case in which such payment is made; and there is this proviso:\nThat when sums reported in favor of any person or persons whatever, whether named or not in said report, shall be paid to any person or persons whomsoever, when the same shall of right belong or ought to have been paid to some other person, it shall be lawful for the person or persons to whom the same ought to have been paid to sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest and costs, as so much money had and received for his use, by the person to whom the same shall have been so paid. Section 13 declares that sums directed to be paid, assessed and reported by the commissioners for the allowance to be made by the person or persons respectively in the said report as owners and proprietors of or parties interested in lands deemed to be benefitted by the extension, shall be borne and paid respectively to the mayor, etc., by the said persons respectively; and imposes on the corporation all the costs of opening, extending, making and finishing Canterbury street, and all the expenses incurred under the act, and authorized the city corporation to issue debentures for payment thereof.\nSection 14 makes the several sums described to be paid to the mayor, etc., be a lien and charge upon the lands in the report mentioned, and the amounts assessed are made payable to such person or persons as the mayor, etc, shall appoint to receive the same; and in default of payment of the same, or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for, and it shall be the duty of, the receiver of taxes of the city of St. John to issue execution under his hand to levy the same with lawful interest thereon, and after thirty days from the filing of the said report of the commissioners, in the same manner and with the like effect, power and authority as upon an assessment of rates and taxes made by the assessors of rates in the said city; and the marshall to whom any such execution shall be delivered shall proceed to levy and collect the same in the same manner and with the like power, authority and effect as upon execution for rates and taxes under the law relating thereto.\nThen follows this proviso:\nProvided that if any money so to be assessed be paid by or collected or recovered from any person or persons when by agreement or by law the same ought to have been borne and paid by some other person or persons, it shall be lawful for the person or persons paying the same, or from whom the same shall be collected or recovered, to sue for and recover the money so paid by or recovered from him or them, with interest and costs, as so much money paid for the use of the person or persons who ought to have paid the same; and the said report of the commissioners, with proof of payment, shall be conclusive evidence in the suit.\nSo far as the proceedings under this act are concerned, there is no dispute in fact, except as to plaintiffs being the owner of land for which he was assessed. The pleadings admit that the commissioners were duly appointed by the Governor in Council\u2014that they were duly sworn and entered on the duties of their office\u2014that they did cause surveys and plans of Canterbury street, and the several lots fronting thereon, to be made and prepared by the city engineer; that the city engineer did make and prepare such plans; that having received such plans, the commissioners did proceed to make a just and equitable estimate of the value of the lands required for extending the street; that they did assess and apportion the whole estimated value of the lands in their discretion and opinion benefited thereby in proportion to the benefit accruing to the parties respectively; that the commissioners did, fourteen days before making their report to the common council, deposit a copy of such estimate and assessment in the office of the common clerk, and did give notice in two public newspapers thereof and of the day on which it would be finally filed as and for a record of their proceedings, and the said commissioners did, at the time named, file with the common council of the city the said plan as and for a record of their doings in that respect, and did forthwith report their proceedings and all matters and things connected with their duties as such commissioners to the common council, and in said report did set forth the names of the respective owners, etc., as far forth as the same was ascertained by them, and a sufficient description of the lots of land, etc., required for extending the street and the lots fronting said street so assessed, as also the sums estimated and assessed for compensation; that defendant appeared in and by the said report as assessed for the purposes of said street on a lot of land along the line of extension of said Canterbury street and fronting thereon, for the benefit accruing to him of $419.46.\nThat after the filing of the plan and report the council appointed Mr. Sandall, chamberlain of the city, to receive from the plaintiff the said sum assessed by the commissioners and all other sums mentioned in the commissioners' report assessed by them; that the said Wm. Sandall, being also receiver of taxes in and for the city of St. John, duly demanded the said amount from plaintiff; and after due notice given and demand made and after the proper time had elapsed, defendant, Sandall, being the receiver of taxes in and for the city of St. John, duly issued an execution under his hand for the recovery of the amount for which plaintiff was assessed, and the same was duly delivered to one Hancock, then being a marshal of the city of St. John, to be executed; that the said marshal proceeded to levy and collect the said assessment in the manner pointed out in the statute, and that plaintiff neglecting and refusing to point out goods and chattels, although requested so to do, he, said marshal, for want of goods and chattels whereon to levy, took the plaintiff and delivered him to the keeper of the jail of the city and county of St. John, in obedience to the exigencies of the warrant to him directed.\nFor this imprisonment the present action is brought, as also for money received by defendants to the use of plaintiffs, as also for money payable by defendants to plaintiff for interest. In other words, it is not disputed in this action that all the proceedings were duly had and taken in strict accordance with the provisions of the statute, and that had plaintiff been the owner of or interested in the lot of land for which he was assessed, he could have no cause of complaint. So that the only question on these pleadings is, does the fact of plaintiff not being the owner of this lot make the corporation of St. John responsible in damages for his name having been placed on the report of the commissioners, or for the act of the receiver of taxes in issuing the warrant, or for the arrest of the plaintiff under it by the marshal? In my opinion none of the parties acting under this statute were in any sense of the term the servants of the corporation, or in any way subject to their orders or control. The whole proceedings were purely statutory, and over which the corporation of St. John had no power, authority or supervision, corporate or otherwise. The commissioners were government officers, and for what they did or omitted to do they were not amenable to the corporation of St. John, and the corporation had no right to interfere with their proceedings, and when the report of the commissioners was filed of record the corporation had no right to alter, amend, take from, add to, or interfere with it in any way. The only duty in relation to their proceedings, or in connection with the assessment or collecting the amount assessed, was when the commissioners had filed their report and it had thus become of record to nominate who should receive the money assessed. They did nominate the chamberlain of the city, but they might quite as well, had they thought proper, have named any other individual. By virtue of such nomination the chamberlain did not become an officer of the corporation in relation to this matter, but a statutory officer under the act, and when he received the money he did not receive it as chamberlain, as an officer under the city charter, but as such officer by virtue of his nomination under the act. So with respect to the receivers of taxes, it so happened that Sandall was also a receiver of taxes. In his character as such under his general appointment, he had no authority to collect those assessments, it was only by virtue of the special duty cast on him by the act that he had any right to intermeddle, and when he discharged the duty thus imposed on him he did so, not as an officer of the corporation or under corporate control, but as a statutory officer independent of the corporation altogether in respect to all acts in relation to this duty so expressly and specially cast on him by the statute; all the corporation could do was to obey the law, take the record as they found it, and act accordingly, without venturing to amend or alter it in any particular; so, too, the marshal, all he had to do was to execute the warrant delivered to him to be executed; the corporation, the appointee of the corporation, the receiver of taxes and the marshal, did just what the law declared they were to do and nothing more. How, then, can it be possible that, assuming the plaintiff to have been intentionally or inadvertently placed by the commissioners on the record as owner when he was not, the corporation can be made liable for the consequences of the act of government officers over whom they had no control and for an act with which they had nothing whatever to do, as they could neither direct who should be put on the commissioners record, nor could they direct any name or names to be taken off, and an act, too, of which they could have no knowledge, nor the means of knowledge, and an act wholly beyond and outside of their corporate functions, and in relation to a matter from which they, as a corporation, received no benefit whatever in their corporate capacity,\u2014the same not being for the corporate advantage and the emolument of the city\u2014the extending of the street may have been, and no doubt was, an improvement to the city generally, and therefore for the benefit of all the citizens and the public at large, but all the duties discharged or acts done in performance of those duties, whether of omission or commission, by the commissioners, the defendant, as collector of taxes, Sandall, in receiving the money, or the marshal in executing the warrant of distress, were not corporate duties performed by servants of the corporation, but duties discharged and acts done by independent officers in the performance of specific duties enjoined on such officers by statute, and over the performance of which the corporation had no control, and therefore no act of the municipal corporation or its agents or servants, and for which the corporation are not responsible at common law nor made so by statute.\nThe statute gave the person named to receive the money, the person appointed to collect it, and the marshal directed to execute the warrant issued for its collection, nothing for their guidance but the report of record of the commissioners, which report they had no right to question but were bound to act on by virtue of the mandatory injunctions of the statute.\nThat a municipal corporation could, under such circumstances, be held liable I should not have thought possible, but for the opinions entertained by a majority of my learned brethren. Principle and authority seems to me alike opposed to the idea of making a municipal corporation liable for acts which are not the acts of the corporation, nor of its agents or servants, but which are the acts of independent officers, and consequently where no relation of principal and agent or master and servant exists, and without which the maxim respondeat superior cannot apply.\nIn Wood's law of master and servant[5] it is said:\nFor the acts of an independent officer whose duties are fixed and prescribed by law, the city cannot be held chargeable upon the principle of respondeat superior, for the relation of master and servant does not exist. Such officers are quasi civil officers of the Government, even though appointed by the corporation. \"Where,\" says Folger, J., in a very able, thoroughly and carefully considered opinion in a recent case heard before the Court of Appeals in New York (Maxmilian v. New York, 62 N.Y., 165), \"a municipal corporation elects or appoints an officer in obedience to an act of the legislature, to perform a public service in which the corporation has no private interest, and from which it derives no special benefit or advantage in its corporate capacity, such officer cannot be regarded as a servant or agent of the municipality, for whose negligence or want of skill it can be held liable. It has appointed or elected him in pursuance of a duty laid upon him by the law for the general welfare of the inhabitants or of the community. He is the person selected by it as the authority empowered by law to make selections; but when selected and its power is exhausted, he is not its agent. He is the agent of the public, for whom and for whose purposes he was selected.\"\nIn Shearman and Redfield's Law of Negligence it is said[6]:\nA municipal corporation is not answerable for the illegal and wrongful acts of the officers, though done colore officii, notwithstanding they were done by its specific directions or were afterwards approved of and ratified by it; for in directing the doing of such acts, or in ratifying them when done, the corporation acts ultra vires. But the corporation is liable for the irregular and illegal exercise, by its authorized agents, of a power which the corporation possesses, as when an officer levied and collected from the plaintiffs a sum imposed by a void assessment, the corporation having had authority to levy the assessment in a regular way, or where a common council, having authority to grade a street on obtaining the consent of two-thirds of the adjacent owners, failed to obtain such consent, but directed the work to be done nevertheless whereby the plaintiff was injured.\nIn Wallace v. The City of Menasha[7] it was held that\nA city is not liable in tort for the act of its treasurer, acting in good faith in the execution of his tax warrant, in seizing and selling the chattels of one person for the delinquent taxes of another. In Thayer v. City of Boston[8] it is said that as a general rule a municipal corporation is not responsible for the unauthorized and unlawful acts of its officers, though done colore officii. It must further appear that they were expressly authorized to do the acts by the city government, or that they were done bon\u00e2 fide in pursuance of a general authority to act for the city, on the subject to which they relate; or that in either case the act was adopted and ratified by the corporation. The levy and collection of taxes are governmental rather than municipal functions, delegated to municipal officers for convenience. It may well be claimed that in the exercise of those functions such officers are public officers, discharging public and not municipal or corporate duties. If so, there seems to be no ground for holding the municipality liable for their torts committed in the exercise of those functions, no room for the application of the rule respondeat superior in such cases. A distinction is made in many cases between torts committed by municipal officers or agents in the discharge of such public duties, and those committed in the discharge of purely municipal or corporate duties by the officers or agents of the city or village, the municipality being held liable for the latter but not liable for the former class of torts.\nIn Hayes v. The city of Oshkosh[9] Dixon, C. J. says:\nThe case made by the plaintiff is in no material respect distinguishable from those adjudicated in Haffard v. New Bedford[10], and Fisher v. Boston[11], as well as in several other reported decisions cited in the briefs of counsel, and in all of which it was held that the actions could not be maintained.\nThe grounds of exemption from liability, as stated in the authorities last named, are, that the corporation is engaged in the performance of a public service, in which it has no particular interest, and from which it derives no special benefit or advantage in its corporate capacity, but which it is bound to see performed in pursuance of a duty imposed by law for the general welfare of the inhabitants or of the community; that the members of the fire department, although appointed by the city corporation, are not, when acting in the discharge of their duties, servants or agents in the employment of the city, for whose conduct the city can be held liable, but they act rather as public officers, or officers of the city charged with a. public service, for whose negligence or misconduct in the discharge of official duty no action will lie against the city, unless expressly given, and hence the maxim respondeat superior has no application.\nIn Wood's Law of Master and Servant[12], it is said: But where the duties of an officer are prescribed by law and are independent in their character, and he is not subject to the direction and control of the corporation as to the time, place or manner of their discharge, he is a public officer, and in no sense a servant or agent of the corporation, and the corporation is not liable for the manner in which he discharges his duties. \"Their powers,\" says Foster, J., in Harvey v. Keen[13] cannot be enlarged or abridged by any action of the town, and what they do, or omit to do, in the proper exercise of their authority, is done or omitted because the law enjoins and prescribes their duties independent entirely of municipal control or authority. \"In this case it was held that a highway surveyor is a public officer.\nIn Oliver v. Worcester[14], Gray, J., says:\u2014\nThe distinction is well established between the responsibilities of towns and cities for acts done in their public capacity, in the discharge of duties imposed upon them by the legislature for the public benefit, and for acts done in what may be called their private character, in the management of property or rights voluntarily held by them for their own immediate profit or advantage as a corporation, although enuring, of course, ultimately to the benefit of the public.\n* * * * * * * *\nIn Bailey v. New York[15], Chief Justice Nelson clearly stated the distinction between acts done by a city or town as a municipal or public body, exclusively for public purposes, and those done for its own private advantage or emolument.\nIn Walcott v. Inhabitants of Swampscott[16], Bigelow, C. J., says:\u2014\nWe cannot disitnguish this case from Haffard vs. City of New Bedford[17]. * * *\nAfter stating what was decided in that case, hereinbefore mentioned, by Dixon, C. J., he says:\u2014\nThis is especially true in the case of surveyors of highways. They are elected by towns and cities, not because they are to render services for their peculiar benefit or advantage, but because this mode of appointment has been deemed expedient by the legislature in the distribution of public duties and burdens for the purposes of government, and for the good order and welfare of the community. They are, strictly speaking, public officers, clothed with certain powers and duties which are prescribed and regulated by statute. Towns cannot direct or control them in the performance of these duties; they cannot remove them from office during the term for which they are chosen; they are not amenable to towns for the manner in which they discharge the trust imposed in them by law; nor can towns exercise any right of selecting the servants or agents by whom they perform the work of repairing the highways. In the discharge of these general duties, they are wholly independent of towns, and can in no sense be considered their servants or agents.\nIn Dillon on Corporations, it is said[18]:\nIf the duty though devolved by law upon an officer elected or appointed by the corporation is not a corporate duty, the officers of the corporation in performing it do not act for the corporation, and hence the corporation is not responsible (unless expressly declared to be by statute) for the omission to perform it or for the manner in which it is performed.\nIn Wood on Master and Servant[19], it is said, under the heading, \"Who are independent officers?\"\nIndependent officers are those who are appointed or elected by the legislature or by the people, or whose duties are fixed and defined by law, and over whose official acts the corporation has no immediate or direct control.\nThe case of Barnes v. District of Columbia[20] has been said to be opposed to the doctrine of the cases cited. However that may be, I think that case clearly distinguishable from the present as it was a decision on a statute in every respect different from the one we are considering; were it not so I should consider it but a questionable authority, which I should be loath to follow, opposed as it is to so many judicial decisions of so many States, and likewise, in my opinion, sound law as applicable to the case before us. And as it was decided by a bare majority of five to four I cannot look upon it as a decision in itself entitled to much weight outside of the court in which it was delivered. But it is now contended that the defendants are liable for false imprisonment on the ground of ratification Whether this question can be properly raised under the pleading it is unnecessary to discuss, because, in my opinion, there is not the slightest ground, either in law or fact, to justify the contention that defendants made themselves in any way liable or responsible for plaintiffs arrest and imprisonment, either by directing or authorizing or adopting or ratifying such arrest and imprisonment. After plaintiff was arrested and in custody he caused the amount of the assessment to be paid to a clerk in the chamberlain's office and obtained his discharge. This is his account of the transaction. He says in his direct examination:\nIt was in this gaol here I paid the deputy clerk $437 or $439 to get out.\nAgain:\nI paid $437 and some cents.\nCross-examined: I did not say I paid the money to Rankin, [the gaoler.] I did not pay it at all. I did not see the money paid. I don't think I swore the money was paid in my presence. It was not paid in my presence.\nJames McSorley, son of plaintiff, says:\n[recollect the day he was taken to gaol. Under your (Mr. Thomson's) directions, I paid the money in the chamberlain's office. I paid it to Mr. Humbert, a clerk in the office. He was not satisfied at first to give me a receipt.\nThis is verbatim et literatum every word as to the payment in plaintiff's case, and there is not another word on the subject in defendant's case. Mr. Thomson raised eight questions, but not one of them has any reference to the payment of the money to obtain release, or to any payment under protest, or to any receipt by the corporation, or to any ratification by the receipt of the money, but rests his right to recover on entirely distinct and different grounds. The learned Chief Justice, in his charge, for the first time apparently, raises the question of ratification, but this he entirely abandons in the full court. I think it clear law that a party cannot be made liable as a trespasser by ratification unless the trespassing was originally done on his behalf and for his benefit. Nor can there be a ratification, unless the party who is sought to be made liable by means of the ratification is shown to have had at the time full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case.\nThere is not a tittle of evidence that this money ever went into the coffers of the corporation of St. John, or that as a corporate body the corporation ever knew that it had been so paid, and if it had it was not corporation money, but money to be held and distributed among the land owners injured by the extensions, and yet it is argued that such payment constituted a ratification and adoption\u2014but of what? I cannot but confess myself at a loss to understand of what this payment was a ratification. Was it of the act of the commissioners? of the receiver of taxes in issuing the warrant and collecting the assessment? of the marshal in executing the warrant? or of the receipt of the money by the clerk of the chamberlain, who must have received it for the chamberlain? and he could only receive it as collector of taxes appointed under the statute, and who, after such receipt under the statute, would be bound to hand it over to the corporation, but of which there is not a particle of evidence that he ever did or that he even ever notified the corporation that it had been so received. There is no evidence whatever to show that the corporation had the slightest knowledge or notice that this plaintiff was not the owner of the land, nor that his name was wrongfully put in the commissioners record, nor that the receiver of taxes had issued the execution, nor that the marshal had executed it, nor that the plaintiff was imprisoned, nor that he had paid the money to obtain his release. How this can be converted into a ratification, or make the corporation wrong doers and liable for false imprisonment, I am at a loss to conceive. Had the chamberlain, after having received the money, accounted for and paid over the amount to the corporation and they had received it, they would have only been doing what the law required they should do. How can the mere fact of the money having been paid into the office of the receiver of taxes\u2014the party the statute required to collect, it and who in collecting it exercised legislative functions, because he happened to be chamberlain, and as such the party nominated under the statute to receive it\u2014make the corporation wrong doers and trespassers, guilty of false imprisonment, and that, too, without it being in any way shown that the corporation ever knew of any illegality in the proceedings, or even that the money was so paid, or that if paid, it was received otherwise than as money legally paid and received under the statute, to be distributed as directed by the statute.\nI can discover no act done by or on behalf of the corporation which they did or could ratify, nor can I discover any such question raised by the pleadings or on the trial in this case. It may be that if the plaintiff was wrongfully assessed and the money had been actually received by the corporation, and it had had notice that the plaintiff was not a property holder and that the money had been wrongfully levied and paid under protest, which it was not, and plaintiff had demanded repayment from the corporation and it had refused, an action for money had and received might possibly have lain at the instance of the plaintiff against the corporation, but this is not entirely clear; but no such question arises in this case, and therefore it would be neither profitable nor proper to discuss it.\nThe authorities in respect to ratification are, to my mind, very clear, and I think sustain what I have said. I will cite a few of them.\nIn Scurry v. Ray[21], it was held that there could be no ratification of an invalid transaction where the person performing the supposed act of ratification has been kept, by the party in whose favor it is made, unaware of the invalidity of the first transaction and has not at the time of the supposed ratification the means of forming an independent judgment.\nIn Eastern Counties Railway Company v. Brown[22], the servant of a railway company took the plaintiff as passenger upon the company's line into custody for an alleged breach of one of the company's by-laws, and carried him before a magistrate. The attorney of the company attended before the magistrate to conduct the charge. Held, this was no evidence that the company ratified the act of their servant.\nA person who knowingly receives from another a chattel which the latter has wrongfully seized, and afterwards on demand refuses to give it back to the owner, does not thereby become a joint trespasser, unless the chattel was seized for his use and benefit[23].\nA corporation cannot be made liable for false imprisonment, unless the party complaining gives evidence justifying the jury in finding that the persons actually imprisoning him had authority from the corporation[24].\nWhere goods of a party are seized under a process which has issued in a suit in which such party is a defendant and the seizure takes place without the knowledge or authority, or in the name of the plaintiff in such suit, the circumstance that the goods afterwards came to his hands, and that he, knowing the circumstances of the seizure, refuses to give them up, do not make him a trespasser[25].\nA principal is not liable for the wrongful acts of his agents though he receives benefit from them, unless at the time of the receipt he has notice of the illegality[26]. In this case it was held a principal is not liable on trespass for the act of his agent, unless he authorized it beforehand, or subsequently assented to it with knowledge of what had been done.\nTherefore, when in an action of trespass against a landlord it appeared that he gave a broker a warrant to distrain for rent and the broker took away and sold a fixture and paid the proceeds to the defendant, who received them without enquiry, but without knowledge that anything irregular had been done, held, that no such authority or assent appeared as would sustain the action. In this case Whiteman, J., said:\nWhere a man is made a trespasser by relation as having assented to it, it is always shown that he knew of the trespass.\nBut the statute evidently contemplated that assessments might be made on wrong persons, and that payments might be made to parties not legally entitled to receive the money, and for both of these contingencies the legislature has provided.\nThus section 14, which provides that the assets shall be a lien and charge upon the land, and establishes the personal liability of the owners, and authorizes the appointment by the corporation of a person to receive the amounts assessed, and imposes the duty on the receiver of taxes to issue executions, and directs the marshal to proceed to levy and collect, ends with this proviso:\nProvided, that if any money so to be assessed be paid by or collected or recovered from any person or persons when by agreement or by law the same ought to have been borne and paid by some other person or persons, it shall be lawful for the person or persons paying the same, or from whom the same shall be collected or recovered, to sue for and recover the money so paid by or recovered from him or them with interest and costs, as so much money paid for the use of the person or persons who ought to have paid the same, and the said report of the commissioners, with proof of payment, shall be conclusive evidence of the suit.\nAnd section 12, which provides that the mayor shall, within one calendar month after assessments are collected, pay to the respective persons mentioned in the report the sums estimated and reported in their favor, and giving authority to parties to sue the corporation, if not paid after application, and providing that if persons entitled are under age of twenty-one years, non compos mentis, feme covert, or absent from roll, or when the names of the owners or persons entitled shall not be set forth, or when persons named cannot be found, the amounts payable to such persons may be paid into the equity side of the Supreme Court, ends with this proviso:\nProvided also, that in all and every case and cases whenever such sum or sums, or compensation, so to be reported by the said commissioners in favour of any person or persons whatsoever, whether named or not named in the said report, shall be paid to any person or persons whomsoever, when the same shall of right belong and ought to have been paid to some other person or persons, it shall be lawful for the person or persons to whom the same ought to have been paid to sue for and recover the same, with legal interest as aforesaid, and costs of suit, as so much money had and received for his, her or their use, by the person or persons respectively to whom the same shall have been so paid.\nThese two clauses very clearly establishing, in my opinion, that if the provisions of the act were complied with and the corporation appointed a party to receive the money when it was received by the corporation, and paid as the report of the commissioners directed, the duty of the corporation was discharged and they were free from liability, and if a wrong party was assessed and compelled to pay, or the amount was paid to a person when it belonged to another, then the aggrieved party was to look to the remedies provided by the statute.\nThe great hardship of this case on plaintiff which has been put forward strikes me as being to a large extent imaginary. The receiver of taxes, upon whom the duty of collecting was cast, as well as the marshal who executed the warrant, appear to have acted with the greatest forbearance and leniency. Plaintiff had ample notice that his name was put down as owner, and so, on the face of the record, was liable for the assessment, but he took no steps whatever to have the record corrected or his name removed; he took no steps to have the collection of the assessment against himself personally restrained, and the lien on the land enforced in lieu thereof; he does not even appear to have notified the commissioners, the receiver of taxes, or the marshal (according to his evidence, and the very contradictory character of plaintiffs evidence precludes his version being accepted), or even the corporation that his name was improperly inserted as owner; but, on the contrary, the evidence shows that by his words and actions he rather encouraged the idea that he was the proper person. He appears to have gone to gaol almost voluntarily, certainly without any necessity, and it would look much as if with the sole view of laying the foundation for an action such as this, for so soon as he is locked up he sends for his money and pays the amount, and that not even under protest; this he could just as well have done without going to gaol. To get the money back there was no necessity whatever for suing the corporation of St. John, equity would enforce the lien on the land in his favour, and the statute evidently contemplated, as we have seen, that mistakes might be made, and that parties not really liable be compelled to pay, and has provided for such a contingency by enacting as before mentioned, so that in truth and in fact the plaintiff could, had he chosen, by taking at the proper time the necessary proceedings, have had himself relieved from the payment of this assessment, and from the effect of having his name inadvertently placed on the record\u2014(it is not suggested that it being so placed was more than an inadvertency; had it been done wilfully or maliciously by the commissioners, doubtless he would have had a. remedy against them)\u2014and could now recover the amount he has paid either from the owner of the land or from the land itself, and so really there is no reason whatever why he should proceed against the corporation of St. John, who in this matter have been guilty of no act of omission or commission morally or legally that I can discover, making them wrong-doers in relation to the plaintiff.\nUnder these circumstances, I think the judgment of the Supreme Court was right, and should be sustained, and this appeal dismissed with costs. The only objection that I think could be raised to the judgment of the court below is, that instead of ordering a new trial a judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto should have been entered, by reason of the insufficiency of the replication to the second plea.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The appellant was not the owner, lessee, nor a party or person interested in any of the lands or premises mentioned in the report of the commissioners, or in any lands or premises in any way benefited by the extension and opening of Canterbury street. The commissioners had, therefore, no jurisdiction to assess the appellant, and their assessment of him was consequently wholly void. The 10th sec of the act in question[27], it is true, declares that the report of the commissioners shall be final and conclusive, but the subsequent part of the clause expressly limits this conclusive effect to persons whom the commissioners had jurisdiction to assess.\nThe language of the act is:\u2014\nAnd upon the coming in and filing of such report the same shall be final and conclusive as well upon the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of St. John, as upon the owners, lessees, parties or persons interested in and entitled unto the lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises mentioned in the said report.\nThere is nothing here warranting the respondents' contention that the report was conclusive as to all the world, upon strangers having no interest in the street as well as upon the property owners. The language is most explicit\u2014it is to be final and conclusive only upon the city and the property owners. Had it been otherwise, and as the respondents contend, it would have been a most arbitrary and unjust enactment. Had the section stopped at the words \"final and conclusive\" I should have implied the limitation which follows, and, without the addition of the subsequent words, have been of opinion that the report was only made binding upon those over whom the commissioners had jurisdiction, the owners of property and persons benefited by the opening of the street. I think the decisions upon statutory provisions, taking away the writ of certiorari, and many decisions upon the Ontario Muncipal Act, would in that case have applied a multo fortiori to shew that the plaintiff was not bound by the report[28]. The 14th section also shews very clearly that the legislature did not intend to give the report the binding effect which the respondents insist upon, for it says:\nThat the respective owners and proprietors of the lands and premises in the said report mentioned, or the parties interested therein, and also the occupant shall be liable to pay on demand the respective sums at which the respective lands so owned and occupied by him, her or them, or wherein he, she or they are so interested, or at which the owners and proprietors thereof shall be assessed, to such person or persons as the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of St. John shall appoint to receive the same.\nWhat language could be clearer than this to show that the only persons bound by the report and liable to pay the amounts assessed against them were owners, occupants and persons interested? The two English cases of Hesketh v. Local Board of Atherton[29] and Cox v. Rabbitts[30] are in point, and show that there is nothing in the act to debar the plaintiff from disputing his liability to assessment. The assessment must therefore be considered as wholly void.\nThen a collecting officer who levies a distress or makes an arrest under a warrant, which, though good upon its face, is founded upon a void assessment, is clearly guilty of a trespass, and the same principle applies to the officer who issues the warrant, and thus directs the distress or arrest to be made.\nThe important question, however, in the present case is whether the rule of respondeat superior applies so as to make the corporation of St. John liable for the acts of the other defendant, Sandall, in issuing his warrant upon the commissioners' report, and thus causing the arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff. The general rule by which this liability is to be tested is so well stated by a learned judge and text writer, whose authority on a question of this kind is preeminent, that I must be excused for extracting at some length what he says upon the subject. Mr. Justice Dillon thus states the rule:\nIt may be observed, in the next place, that where it is sought to render a municipal corporation liable for the act of servants or agents, a cardinal enquiry is whether they are the servants or agents of the corporation. If the corporation appoints or elects them, and can control them in the discharge of their duties, can continue or remove them, can hold them responsible for the manner in which they discharge their trust, and if their duties relate to the exercise of corporate powers, and are for the peculiar benefit of the corporation in its local or special interest, they may be justly regarded as its agents or servants, and the maxim of respondent superior applies. But if, on the other hand, they are elected or appointed by the corporation in obedience to the Statute to perform a public service not peculiarly local or corporate, but because this mode of selection has been deemed expedient by the legislature in the distribution of the powers of the Government, if they are independent of the corporation as to the tenure of their office and the manner of discharging their duties, they are not to be regarded as the servants or agents of the corporation for whose acts or negligence it is impliedly liable, but as public or statutory officers, with such powers and duties as the statute confers upon them, and the doctrine of respondeat superior is not applicable. It will thus be seen that on general principles it is necessary, in order to make a municipal corporation impliedly liable on the maxim of respondeat superior for the wrongful act or neglect of an officer, that it be shown that the officer was its officer, either generally or as respects the particular wrong complained of, and not an independent public officer; and also that the wrong was done by such officer while in the legitimate exercise of some duty of a corporate nature which was devolved upon him by law or by the direction or authority of the corporation.\nTested by this general rule it appears to me that the liability of the city for the act of Sandall is beyond question. He was an officer of the city specially appointed to receive the moneys to be collected and levied under the act in pursuance of the assessments of the commissioners. By the 14th section the parties liable were to pay the sums of money assessed by the commissioners \"to such person or persons as the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of city of St. John shall appoint to receive them,\" and it is then provided that in default of payment it should be lawful, and the duty of the receiver of taxes of the city of St. John, to issue execution under his hand, and to levy the amounts as prescribed by the section in question, namely, by distress or imprisonment. In exercise of this power the city appointed William Sandall, who was already their officer, being by appointment of the city its chamberlain and general receiver of taxes. The official character of Sandall was, therefore, a double one: 1st, he was, by the special appointment of the city under the act, the person to receive the moneys assessed by the commissioners under the statute, and as such it was his duty to make the demand of payment mentioned in the 14th section, and, secondly, he was the general receiver of taxes for the city, and in that character it was incumbent on him to issue execution and make levies for such of these special assessments as the commissioners should have legally imposed. It thus appears to me that Sandall was beyond all doubt an officer for whose acts in respect of the collection of these assessments the city was liable, upon the principles stated in the extract from Mr. Justice Dillon's note, which I have before given. He was an officer appointed by the city, in obedience to a statute, it is true, but in this respect his appointment in no way differs from that of the great majority of municipal officers whose appointments are prescribed by statute, he committed the wrongful act complained of in the discharge of a duty imposed by law, not for the benefit of the general public, but for the peculiar benefit of the corporate body whose servant he was, the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of St. John, and the money which was exacted from the plaintiff, and which was the fruit of Sandall's illegal act, was received and applied to the benefit of the city. Moreover, it was in his character of receiver of taxes, a general officer of the city, not appointed under the statute, that he committed the trespass complained of by causing the false imprisonment of the plaintiff.\nIt being beyond question on the construction of the statute as before shewn that the assessment of the plaintiff was void, and that the warrant or execution was as a consequence also void, it is not material to inquire whether the commissioners were officers of the corporation for whose acts the city was responsible. If the assessment was void, the acts of Sandall were illegal, and the city was responsible for those acts, on the principle before stated, whether the commissioners were or were not persons for whose illegal conduct the city was also liable.\nI think, however, that even if we had to go back to the assessment and show that the city was responsible for the illegal conduct of the commissioners, there would not be much difficulty in establishing the liability of the respondents and sustaining this appeal. The commissioners were, it is true, a body appointed not by the corporation, but by the Lieutenant-Governor under the statute. They were, however, appointed, not for the performance of a service for the benefit of the general public, but one of a peculiarly local and corporate character for the benefit of the corporation. This being so, it appears that although not elected by the commonalty or ratepayers, or appointed by the governing body of the city, but by the executive head of the province, they are just as much officers of the corporation as if they had been nominated by it or chosen by the corporators. Very high authorities in the United States warrant this conclusion. In the case of Barnes v. District of Columbia[31], the Supreme Court of the United States held that the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia was liable for the wrongful acts of commissioners, constituting a board of public works to which was delegated the duty of keeping in repair the streets and avenues of the district, who were not appointed by the corporation, -nor elected by the people or ratepayers, but were nominated by the President of the United States; it being considered that the duties of the board being of a local and corporate and not of a general public character, it was to be considered as forming a part of the municipal corporation of which its members were consequently the officers. The corporation was therefore held liable for an injury resulting from the neglect of the board in failing to keep a street in proper repair. In giving the judgment of the court, Mr. Justice Hunt says:\nThe mayor of a city may be elected by the people, or he may be appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate, but the slightest reflection will shew that the power of this officer, his position as the chief agent and representative of the city, are the same under either mode of appointment. Whether his act in a case in question is the act of and binding on the city, depends upon his powers under the charter to act for the city, and whether he has acted in pursuance of them, not at all upon the manner of his election. It is equally unimportant from what source he receives compensation, or whether he serves without it, nor are these by any means conclusive considerations in any case.\nIn the case of Bailey v. The Mayor[32], the same doctrine had previously received the assent of the Supreme Court of New York. In that case the city of New York was held liable for the negligence of certain statutory commissioners appointed by the governor under the authority of an act of the legislature for supplying the city with water. Nelson, C. J., in giving the judgment of the court states the point raised by the defendants and upon which the case turned to have been that\nThe defendants were not chargeable with negligence or unskilfulness in the construction of the dam in question, inasmuch as the water commissioners were not appointed by them, nor subject to their direction or control. In other words, the commissioners, not being their agents in the construction of the dam, the rule respondeat superior could not properly be applied.\nAnd he then proceeds to give judgment for the plaintiff upon the ground that the commissioners, although appointed by the state and not by the city, were, by reason of the work which they were appointed to control being for the special and corporate benefit of the city and not for that of the general public, to be considered as the officers and servants of the city, which was therefore responsible for their acts. This case was subsequently affirmed in appeal[33].\nIn Maximilian v. The Mayor[34], decided in 1875, the whole of this doctrine is most ably reviewed by a very distinguished judge\u2014Folger, since Chief Justice of New York\u2014in delivering the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals. The principle of Bailey v. The Mayor was in this late case affirmed, and the conclusion was arrived at that the corporation was liable where the acts complained of were to be done by officers whose powers and duties were given and taken for the benefit of the corporation and as a local and corporate body, but not so when the duties enjoined and powers granted were for the benefit of the general public as distinguished from the local public of the city, and are delegated as a convenient method of exercising a function of general government.\nTaking these authorities, and the sound principles of law they enunciate, as guides, as from the high sanction which they have received we safely may, I am of opinion that if it were necessary here in order to entitle the appellant to recover to hold that the city of St. John was liable for the acts of the commissioners appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor under the statute, in wrongfully and illegally assessing the appellant, we should be justified in doing so. For the reason, however, that it appears to me clear that Sandall was guilty of a trespass for which the city is liable for the reasons already stated, I prefer to rest the decision of the case on this latter ground. My judgment must therefore be that the judgment appealed against be reversed with costs, and the rule nisi for a new trial in the court below be discharged with costs.\nFOURNIER J.:\nApr\u00e8s le d\u00e9sastreux incendie qui r\u00e9duisit en cendre la partie commerciale de la Cit\u00e9 de St. John, en 1877, la l\u00e9gislature du Nouveau-Brunswick passa l'acte 41 Vic., ch. 9, autorisant l'\u00e9largissement de certaines rues, ainsi que l'extension de la rue Canterbury. Le mode indiqu\u00e9 par ce statut pour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux \u00e0 faire pour op\u00e9rer ces changements ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 longuement expos\u00e9 par l'honorable juge-en-chef, il serait inutile pour moi d'y revenir. Il a aussi cit\u00e9 toutes les parties de cette loi qui peuvent lui donner le caract\u00e8re d'une loi imposant \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de St John, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, distinct de celui de la Cit\u00e9, comme municipalit\u00e9, l'obligation de faire les am\u00e9liorations en question. Il conclut, comme la Cour Inf\u00e9rieure, du caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif de ces dispositions que la Cit\u00e9 de St John, dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 que l'instrument de la loi, et qu'elle n'a pu non plus que ses officiers, encourir aucune responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Pour d\u00e9cider la question qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve en cette cause, il faut d'abord d\u00e9terminer le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re de cette loi.\nMalheureusement le pr\u00e9ambule ne nous est d'aucun secours pour r\u00e9soudre cette premi\u00e8re question. Il y est seulement dit que l'am\u00e9lioration en question est d\u00e9sirable et il n'appert aucunement par qui elle est demand\u00e9e. Bien qu'il soit assez raisonnable de pr\u00e9sumer que cette loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par la cit\u00e9 qui devait en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier, il n'y en a cependant pas de preuve. Toutefois certaines parties de cette loi me paraissent faire voir clairement que la seule partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans ces travaux est la Cit\u00e9 qui doit les faire ex\u00e9cuter. Ainsi, dans la 10e sec., apr\u00e8s avoir statu\u00e9 que les commissaires charg\u00e9s de l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'il sera n\u00e9cessaire d'exproprier remettront leur rapport au greffier de la Cit\u00e9, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce rapport sera final:\nShall be final and conclusive as well upon the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of St John as upon the owners, &c., &c., and the said Mayor, &c., shall become possessed of all the said lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises in the said report mentioned that shall or may be so required for the widening and extending of the said streets respectively, the sum to be appropriated, converted and used to and for such purpose accordingly and none others whatsoever.\nLa 12e section oblige la cit\u00e9 de St John \u00e0 payer conjointement les sommes fix\u00e9es par les commissaires. A d\u00e9faut de paiement et apr\u00e8s demande faite en la mani\u00e8re y sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pourront en poursuivre le recouvrement avec int\u00e9r\u00eat contre la cit\u00e9.\nMay sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest at the rate of six per centum per annum, with costs of suit, in action of debt against the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of St. John, in any Court having cognizance thereof.\nLa 13e section contient la d\u00e9claration suivante:\nAnd the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of St. John shall bear and pay the several amounts which the Commissioners shall determine as aforesaid are to be paid by said City Corporation for the widening of said streets as hereinbefore mentioned, to be certified to them, and also the costs of widening, making and finishing the said streets and parts of streets so to be widened, and also the costs of opening, extending and making and finishing the said Canterbury street, &c.\nLa 14e section statue que les sommes payables en vertu du rapport des commissaires seront pay\u00e9es \u00e0 telle personne que la Cit\u00e9 nommera pour les recevoir. A d\u00e9faut de paiement, le receveur des taxes de la Cit\u00e9 a le pouvoir d'en pr\u00e9lever le montant par warrant.\nPar la 16e section la Cit\u00e9 doit payer les frais et les services des commissaires.\nPar la 17e section les commissaires doivent aussi \u00e9valuer les sommes que la Cit\u00e9 sera tenue de payer pour les avantages qui pourront lui r\u00e9sulter des am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 faire aux rues Dorset et Wolf et partie des rues Lennox et Smythe. La Cit\u00e9 doit aussi payer le salaire des commissaires avec leurs d\u00e9penses et aussi la somme de $15,000, montant estim\u00e9 pour finir les travaux \u00e0 faire dans les dites rues.\nLa 18e section autorise la Cit\u00e9 \u00e0 emprunter une somme suffisante pour couvrir toutes les d\u00e9penses, et les 19e et 20e sections indiquent le mode d'emprunter par d\u00e9bentures. Au cas de d\u00e9faut dans le fonds d'amortissement qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli pour le remboursement de l'emprunt autoris\u00e9, la balance sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur la partie de la Cit\u00e9 situ\u00e9e du c\u00f4t\u00e9-est du H\u00e2vre de St. John.\nQuoique la plupart des dispositions ci-dessus cit\u00e9es s'appliquent \u00e0 d'autres rues que celle de Canterbury, elles n'en font pas moins voir que tous les travaux ordonn\u00e9s par cet acte sont d'un caract\u00e8re municipal\u2014et qu'ils ne sont ainsi ordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de St. John que comme municipalit\u00e9 et dans son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat. Bien que les dispositions soient diff\u00e9rentes pour les am\u00e9liorations de la rue Canterbury elles sont cependant comme les autres d'un caract\u00e8re municipal. L'acte concernant ces ouvrages n'a pas le double caract\u00e8re d'un acte municipal et d'un acte concernant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de la province. De plus les l\u00e9gislatures locales ayant par l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord un pouvoir illimit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gislater sur les institutions municipales, il \u00e9tait au pouvoir de celle du Nouveau-Brunswick d'imposer, m\u00eame directement, \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de St. John, les am\u00e9liorations mentionn\u00e9es dans l'acte ci-dessus cit\u00e9 et d'en prescrire le mode de gouvernement. Il s'en suit que la municipalit\u00e9 ne peut \u00e9viter la responsabilit\u00e9 provenant soit de sa faute, soit de celle des officiers agissant pour elle dans la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de cette loi.\nEn donnant effet au rapport des commissaires et en nommant son receveur de taxes, pour recevoir le montant des \u00e9valuations, et au besoin en pr\u00e9lever le montant par warrant, la Cit\u00e9 n'a pu \u00e9viter la responsabilit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s des Commissaires et de son receveur de taxes.\nLes commissaires ayant, sans droit quelconque, oblig\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 payer comme propri\u00e9taire tandis qu'il ne l'\u00e9tait pas; de plus la corporation n'\u00e9tant pas oblig\u00e9e d'ex\u00e9cuter ce rapport, quoique partie \u00e0 l'instance d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par eux, mais ayant jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'y donner suite, elle doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre tenue responsable. En outre cette somme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e dans le bureau du receveur des taxes en vertu du warrant d'emprisonnement qu'il avait fait \u00e9mettre contre l'appelant, je suis d'avis que la Cit\u00e9 est responsable et que l'appel devait \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nAyant pris communication des notes de l'honorable juge Henry, je concours dans les raisonnements qui l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action for arrest and false imprisonment with a count for money had and received. The respondents justified under a warrant issued by the defendant Sandall, the receiver of taxes in the city of St. John, to collect an amount alleged to have been assessed upon the appellant under an act of the legislature of New Brunswick (41 Vic., ch. 9) to provide for the widening, extension and opening of certain streets in that city, among others, Canterbury street.\nThey also pleaded not guilty, and to the second count never indebted as alleged.\nThe jury, under the direction of the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick, before whom the case was tried, found for the appellant on the pleas of justification, and \"not guilty,\" and for the respondents on the plea of never indebted.\nIt was amongst other things alleged, in the second plea of the respondents, that the appellant by an estimate and appraisement, under the act before mentioned of commissioners duly authorized and appointed under that act and duly filed in the office of the common clerk of the city, was duly assessed as the owner of or interested in land fronting on Canterbury street, to the amount of four hundred and nineteen dollars and forty-six cents; that payment of the said sum was duly demanded of him by the defendant (William Sandall), who had been appointed by the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the said city to receive and collect the same, and that he, the appellant, failed to pay the same; that subsequently the warrant under which he was arrested was duly issued by the defendant (William Sandall), and that the appellant was thereunder arrested and committed to jail. To this plea the appellant, in substance, replied that he never was\u2014\nAt any time in any way directly or indirectly the owner of or otherwise in any way legally or equitably, or otherwise howsoever, interested in the lot of land and premises in the said second plea mentioned or any part thereof,\" nor was he ever \"at any time whatever, the owner, occupier, or lessee of any lands and premises in the city of St John, through which the said extension of Canterbury street passes, or which are or were affected by the said act of the general assembly, nor had he any interest of any kind whatsoever directly or indirectly, legally or equitably, in any of the lots of land or lands and premises of any kind affected by the said act. Issue was joined upon the replication by the respondents.\nThe defence of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, as well as that of the respondent Sandall, was therefore by them, in accepting the issue tendered by the appellant, to depend on their proving that he was liable under the provisions of the act to be assessed. That was the simple issue of fact to be tried. It is not too much to say that so far from any evidence having been given in that direction, it is admitted that the appellant had no land or property fronting on Canterbury street or any to be affected by the terms of the act.\nThat issue was, therefore, in my opinion, properly found in favor of the appellant.\nIt was not an immaterial but an important issue, as the act limits the right of the commissioners to the assessment of parties who were the owners of, or interested in, lands fronting on the extension of the streets mentioned in the act. The commissioners would, therefore, have no more right to assess a resident of St. John whose land was not such as referred to in the act, than they would to tax a resident of Ottawa who was not the owner, occupier, or interested in land in any part of St John.\nIt is clear from the evidence, and indeed it was fully admitted, that the assessment upon the appellant was wholly unjustified by the provisions of the statute.\nHad the issue not been narrowed by the replication to the one point, by which other allegations in the second plea are to be taken as admitted, I should have been inclined to think the evidence of the notification and demand of payment of the assessment insufficient; and I am not at all satisfied but that previous to the issue of the warrant, evidence under oath of the demand and non-payment of the assessment should have been given to justify the issue of it. Those matters, however, are not before us, either in the pleadings or otherwise, and I need give no opinion as to them.\nI will now briefly refer to the defence under the plea of \"Not Guilty.\"\nNone of the respondents were immediately connected with the arrest of the appellant, which was made by the city marshall under a warrant issued by the defendant Sandall. If, then, the arrest was illegal, and that the appellant had to pay over four hundred dollars to obtain his discharge from prison, is he entitled to any redress, and from whom?\nIn the first place, was Sandall justified in issuing the warrant? From the best consideration I have been enabled to give to the subject, I am of the opinion he was not. If the commissioners had the right to assess the appellant and did so, and the act provided that the person or persons to be appointed by the city authorities should have authority to demand payment of the assessments made by the commissioners, and issue warrants to collect them, there could be no question of the right of Sandall to issue the warrant in question; but the right to issue the warrant depends upon the right of the commissioners to assess the appellant. The legal act of the commissioners is, therefore, the foundation and source of the authority of Sandall. The act makes the report of the commissioners, where no objections are made, or provided by it, final and conclusive and binding on the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, and \"upon the owners, lessees, parties or persons interested in and entitled unto the lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises mentioned in the said report.\" The appellant in this case was assessed for a lot owned and occupied by another. The latter, and not the appellant, is the party to be bound by the act of the commissioners; and the statute provides that the assessment shall be a lien on the lands assessed. By virtue of that provision the lot in question is now under a lien for the amount of the assessment, unless removed by irregularities or laches. The appellant was not in any way bound by the act of assessment, as the commissioners had no authority to assess him. Their act in that respect being wholly void, no one acting to the injury of another can justify under it. Every one who interferes with the liberty or property of another, either personally or by means of process issued, must shew a legal right to do so, and the responsibility cannot be shifted by alleging the wrongful act of another by which the party inflicting the injury is induced to do it. A party in the position of the respondent Sandall must act at his peril. If the commissioners had no right to assess the appellant, he (Sandall) was not bound to issue the warrant. It is alleged that the statute made it his duty to issue warrants in all cases where the assessments were not paid. That duty is, however, limited to assessments legally made. It may be said that the respondent Sandall was not to inquire as to the regularity of the assessments. That in some cases may be correct, but in this one the commissioners had a prescribed and limited jurisdiction, and it was the duty of the respondent Sandall, before issuing his warrant, to satisfy himself that in making the special assessments the commissioners had not exceeded their jurisdiction. The obligation may seem a hard one, but every one who accepts a public office of emolument has to assume responsibilities which are necessary for the safety and protection of the rights of others. I am of opinion that the respondent Sandall was not justified in issuing the warrant, and that the two issues were properly found against him.\nThe next and only remaining question is as to liability of the other defendants.\nThe report of the commissioners improperly and illegally assessing the appellant was laid before the common council on the 18th of Dec., 1877, and that body appointed Sandall to collect the assessments (including that of the appellant) on the 27th of February following. The mayor, aldermen and commonalty, therefore, appointed him to collect from the appellant the illegal assessment, and upon failure to pay it, to issue the warrant under which he was arrested. Are they not responsible for that illegal act? Can they be excused when a wrong resulted by the allegation of the illegal act of the commissioners? They were equally bound as Sandall to consider the prescribed and limited powers of the commissioners, and were not only not bound to order the collection of the assessment from the appellant, but, on the contrary, to prevent, as they had the power, their own appointee making the collection. It cannot be successfully contended, that the mayor, aldermen and commonalty had not the power to order the name of the appellant to be struck out from the list of assessments. I have carefully considered the reasons for the judgments given in this case by the learned judges in the court below, and have considered also the case of Hatheway v. Cummings[35] referred to by two of them, but cannot agree with them as to the distinguishable features of the two cases.\nIn the one just cited, the plaintiff sued in trespass for the seizure of his horse and waggon under a warrant issued by the defendant, who was treasurer and collector of taxes at Fredericton, for non-payment of taxes. The court unanimously found that the taxes were illegally assessed, and sustained a verdict for the plaintiff. The court found that the assessors had illegally assessed the plaintiff, and the treasurer and collector was found to have acted illegally in issuing the warrant to enforce the assessment. They did not hold that the treasurer and collector was bound by the illegal act of the assessors and to give effect to it by the issue of his warrant. It might have been as well said in that case, as in this, that they were all acting under statutory powers\u2014for, in the former the whole matter of the assessment was regulated by statute, and the duties of those to make the assessment and collect them were specially prescribed. The main, and, indeed, only difference that I can discover is, that in the one case the assessors were appointed by the civic authorities, while, in the other, the commissioners were appointed by the Governor in Council. Both were, however, city assessments, and when collected, were to be paid to the city treasurer. It matters little in the circumstances of this case who appointed the commissioners.\nIt is, however, contended that in this case the city authorities were nothing but conduit pipes to pass the amount of the assessments from those taxed to those who were entitled to it under the appraisement\u2014that, in fact, the mayor, aldermen and commonalty were trustees of a naked trust without interest in the subject-matter; that no privity existed between them and their appointee, and that as to them the defendant Sandall was not in the relation of a servant. I have already shown that they appointed Sandall and authorized him to do the illegal act complained of. That, in my judgment, would be sufficient to bind them for his act in carrying out their requisition to him. When, however, we consider the object and purview of the act, it is plain that the city authorities, as representing the city, were interested as owners and principals throughout. By the act the commissioners were authorised to fix the proportion the mayor, aldermen and commonalty should pay of the appraisements for damages to persons whose lands were taken for the improvement of the streets. In reference to two of the streets the liability of the city was limited to twenty thousand dollars. In reference to one there was no such limit; but in reference to another, the act provided the city was to pay one-half, and in the several clauses the liability of the city to pay such proportions was enacted because \"of the public advantage accruing to the city of St. John\" by the widening of the several streets. In reference to Canterbury street there is no such provision for requiring the city to pay any part of the appraisements, but on the filing of the report of the commissioners with the necessary plans, it was enacted in section 10, that all the lands taken for the widening and extension of the streets should vest in the mayor, aldermen and commonalty for the purpose of the said streets. Here, then, there was a direct interest from the time of the first proceeding after the act was passed. The city was to be benefited and advantaged, and it was to own the lands upon which the improvements were to be made. It was to pay thousands of dollars for the improvements, and the mayor, aldermen and commonalty were authorized to borrow money on city debentures to pay the sums before mentioned with the charges of the commissioners and other disbursements mentioned in section 16, and also fifteen thousand dollars for \"cutting down, opening, making and finishing of said streets so widened, extended and opened under this act,\" as provided in section 17.\nAlthough there is no evidence of the fact before us, we may fairly assume that the act was passed at the instance of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, and that it was drafted and prepared under their direction. I could not imagine such a thing as the legislature dealing with the subject except on the application of the city authorities.\nBy the act they are authorized and undertake to have the contemplated improvements made. They are the moving parties and the principals from beginning to end, and they, representing the city, have the power over the whole of the proceedings after the report of the commissioners was filed. They may not have been answerable for the illegal act of the commissioners, as they did not appoint them, but they had the power to stay proceedings and could refuse to adopt any illegality or irregularity previous to the authority given to the defendant Sandall to collect an illegal assessment. Unless they did so I think they are answerable for the consequences. I think, for the purposes of this suit, the mayor, aldermen and commonalty must, and should, be considered the principals, and Sandall, the other respondent, their agent; and if not originally answerable for his illegal issue of the warrant, they certainly made themselves answerable when adopting his wrongful act by receiving the proceeds of it.\nIt might be contended that the appellant could, under the latter clause of section 14, recover from the owner of the lot in question the amount assessed upon the lot if paid by the former, but even had he that recourse under the statute it would not justify the illegal assessment of a party not liable to it; nor do I think the provision was intended to cover any such case; nor do I think the legislature intended that money should be extracted from a person not in any way within the provisions of the act, and the only indemnity provided being the right of action against one between whom and the party so paying there was no privity in respect of the land for which he was assessed, and from whom he might never be able to recover it. I am of opinion that the mayor, aldermen and commonalty were primarily liable for the illegal act of the respondent Sandall, but their adoption of his wrongful issue of the warrant, by receiving and retaining the money recovered through the illegal arrest and imprisonment of the appellant, is sufficient, in my opinion, to put the case beyond any reasonable doubt.\nI think, for the reasons I have given, that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, the rule for setting aside the verdict for the appellant discharged, and judgment entered for him for the amount of the verdict in his favor, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nFor the reasons given by the Chief Justice, whose notes he has kindly given me an opportunity to see, I am of opinion that the corporation of St. John cannot be held liable for the trespass complained of by the plaintiff in this case. The rule respondeat superior cannot apply here, for the very good reason that the corporation was not Sandall's superior in the matter of the execution of the warrant against the plaintiff. Sandall was not acting for and in the name of the corporation, or for its benefit, or in its interest, when he executed this warrant. The corporation was only the channel through which this money had to pass, and had no control whatsoever over the proceedings. Sandall was bound to act\u2014the statute ordered him to do so. The plaintiff has no right of action against the corporation, as I view the case.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThat the defendant Sandall was liable to have rendered against him the verdict rendered by the jury upon the first count of the declaration does not, in my judgment, admit of a doubt, and I am of opinion also that the other defendants, the mayor and commonalty of the city of St. John, whom the jury have found to have adopted the act of the defendant Sandall, were also equally liable with him.\nThe plaintiff was arrested under a warrant signed by the defendant Sandall, who was a servant of the corporation of the city of St John, filling as such the offices of receiver of taxes and of chamberlain of the city. Under this warrant so signed the plaintiff was arrested and detained in custody in the common gaol until he was obliged to pay, and did pay, to the defendants, the corporation, in the office of the chamberlain of the city, the sum of $437, and until a clerk in the office of the chamberlain signed a paper acknowledging the receipt of the above sum, and authorizing the discharge of the plaintiff from custody.\nTo discharge himself from liability for issuing the warrant and causing the arrest of the plaintiff thereunder, it is plain that the defendant Sandall must plead and prove a legal justification. He attempts to do this under a provincial statute, 41st Vic., ch. 9. This was an act passed for the purpose of widening certain streets in the city of St. John, and among others, Canterbury street. The act authorized the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to appoint three commissioners to cause a survey and plan of the proposed improvement, and of the several lots of land fronting on the street proposed to be widened or extended, to be made and prepared by the city engineer, and that so soon as such plan should be made the commissioners should assess and apportion the whole estimated value of the land required and taken for the extension and opening of Canterbury street, upon the parties owning or interested in any land along the line of such extension, and in the opinion of the commissioners benefited thereby, according to their best judgment, in proportion to the benefit accruing to such parties respectively from such extension and opening of Canterbury street.\nBy sec. 10 it was enacted that the commissioners, upon completing such estimate, assessment and apportionment, should file with the common clerk of the city the said plan, and should forthwith report their proceedings and all matters and things connected with their duties as such commissioners to the common council of the city, and that in such report should be set forth the names of the respective owners, lessees, or persons entitled to, or interested in, the lands mentioned in the report so far as they could ascertain them; and a sufficient designation of the land required for widening and extending the street, and also of the lots fronting thereon so assessed for such benefit as aforesaid; and also the several sums assessed as compensation for the value of the land taken for the street; and also the sums assessed for the benefit of the respective owners of the fee in such lands, and of the respective owners of a leasehold estate, or other interest therein, and that upon such report being filed the same should be final and conclusive, as well upon the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city as upon the owners, lessees, parties or persons interested in and entitled unto the lands mentioned in the said report, and that the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty should become possessed of the lands mentioned in the report that should be required for the purpose of the widening and extending the street, to be appropriated and used for that purpose, and for none other.\nBy the 11th sec. it was enacted, that the commissioners, after completing their estimate, and at least fourteen days before they should make their report to the common council, should deposit a copy of such estimate and assessment in the office of the common clerk for the inspection of whomsoever it might concern, and should give notice by advertisement, to be published in at least two of the public newspapers printed in the city, of the deposit thereof, and of the day on which it could be finally filed. The section then made provision enabling any person whose rights might be affected thereby to state his objections to the commissioners, and in case they should be unable to agree making provision for an arbitration for the purpose of varying the amount estimated.\nNow, the words in this section coming under the designations involved in the words, \"for the inspection of whomsoever it might concern,\" and \"any person whose rights might be affected thereby,\" plainly mean the persons before spoken of as the parties to be assessed as the owners of or interested in land benefited in the opinion of the commissioners, and the owners of land taken for the street who were entitled to receive compensation therefor: these were the only persons whose rights could, under the act, be affected by the commissioners' estimate; a person having no interest whatever in land taken, or in land fronting on the street, and which could derive benefit from the improvement, could have no possible object in inspecting the estimate made in the commissioners' report, and could have no possible right to dispute the amount of the estimate and assessment made in favor of the owners of land taken, as against the owners of land benefited, in the opinion of the commissioners.\nBy the 12th sec. it was enacted, that the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city, within one month after the several assessments, made as in the act is provided, for the purposes of the act, should be collected and received by them, should pay, to the respective parties mentioned or referred to in the report in whose favor any sum should be estimated, the respective sums so estimated as such sum, if any, as they might in like manner be declared liable to pay for any benefit to them respectively accruing from the widening and opening of the street; and that any person entitled to receive such sum might, at any time after application first made to the corporation, sue for and recover the same.\nFrom this section it appears that after the commissioners' report should become final, as well upon the corporation as upon the owners of, and persons interested, in lands taken or benefited, the collection of the amounts charged upon the owners of the lands benefited, and the duty of paying the owners of lands taken the amounts assessed in their favor, was by the statute left with the corporation, who became the owners of the lands so taken for the street; and by the 14th section of the act it was enacted, that the several and respective sums by the act directed to be paid to the corporation should be a lien and charge upon the lands in the report mentioned and upon the estate and interest of the respective owners and lessees of such lands for which such sums should be so assessed by the commissioners, and upon the owners thereof, or parties interested therein, and that as well the said owners and proprietors thereof and parties interested, and also the occupants, should be respectively liable to pay on demand the respective sums mentioned in the report at which the respective lands occupied by them, or in which they were interested, were assessed, to such person as the mayor, aldermen and commonalty should appoint to receive the same; and in default of payment of the same that it should be lawful for, and the duty of, the receiver of taxes of the city to issue execution under his hand to levy the same, with lawful interest thereon, from and after thirty days from the time of filing the said report, in the same manner and with the like effect, power and authority as upon any assessment of rates and taxes made by the assessors of rates in the said city.\nNow, \"the receiver of taxes\" here named is an officer of the corporation, and is plainly assigned the duty here mentioned of collecting by process of law the sums made recoverable by the act, because of the position held by him as such officer and as a duty annexed to his office as a servant of the corporation, in like manner as is imposed upon him the duty, in such his capacity, of collecting by process of law all assessments and rates made payable to the corporation, who have control of such their officer and are empowered by 22nd Vic., ch. 37, sec. 29, to make by-laws for the government of the receiver of taxes (among other officers of the corporation) and to order and direct the mode in which he shall execute his duties, and to impose penalties for the enforcing thereof. The form of execution which the receiver of taxes is authorized to issue for enforcing payments of rates payable to the corporation is given in 24 Vic., ch. 29, and it purports to authorize any marshal of the city\nTo levy, by sale of the goods and chattels of A. B. within the city, the sums which have been assessed upon him, and also for costs of execution and levying, the whole being and have that money at my office on the day of and for want of goods and chattels whereon to levy take the said A. B. and deliver him to the keeper of the goal of the city and county of St. John, who is hereby required to receive him and keep him sasfely days unless the same, with costs, be sooner paid and make return hereof at the day and place aforesaid.\nUnder a warrant in this form, signed by the defendant Sandall as receiver of taxes of the city of St. John, and filled up with a direction to levy of the goods and chattels of the plaintiff the sum of $437 and for want of goods and chattels, &c., to take and deliver him to the keeper of the gaol, who should keep him safely 360 days, unless the above amount, with costs, &c., be sooner paid, the plaintiff was arrested and detained in custody until he was obliged to pay the above sum to the city corporation through their chamberlain, which office, as well as that of receiver of taxes, the defendant Sandall also filled.\nIn the report of the commissioners, filed in the office of the clerk of the common council, the name of John McSorley is erroneously entered as the owner of a lot on Canterbury street, which lot the commissioners assess as benefited by the proposed improvement to the above amount of $437, although on the plan accompanying the report one \"McSorley,\" not giving any christian name, is set down as owner. It is now admitted that the plaintiff is not, and that he never was, the owner, or occupant of, or interested in, the lot in question, or of any land on the street, or mentioned in the report. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to contend that the act in question imposes upon the plaintiff any liability to pay the amount assessed as the benefit accruing to the lot in question, or any part of such sum; the act makes the amount assessed a lien and charge upon the lot, but the personal liability which the act imposes is only upon the owner or occupant, or party interested therein, and as the plaintiff fills none of these characters the act affords no justification for his arrest, and the defendant Sandall is therefore beyond all question liable on the count for false arrest.\nThe corporation are in my opinion, equally so. They do not plead separately from Sandall. They join with him in their pleas, one of which is a justification under authority of the act, and if the act does not justify him it cannot justify them, and the plaintiff is entitled to have the issue joined upon this plea decided in his favor. But the corporation have also pleaded not guilty, and although matters pleaded in one plea cannot be read as admissions upon an issue joined on another, still, matters given in evidence in relation to an issue joined on one plea, may, if applicable to an issue joined upon another, be applied to the determination of the latter. Now, it being established that the act in the particular case gave no authority to the receiver of taxes of the city to issue an execution authorizing the arrest of the plaintiff, we must regard the writ as issued by a servant of the corporation under their control without any legal authority to justify its issue; the question then is, was the act authorized by the corporation, or was it done by their servant in their interest, or for their benefit, and have they accepted and retained the benefit, or have they adopted the act of their officer as their own. These were questions wholly for the jury to pass upon.\nAs to this, then, we find that, in order to enable the receiver of taxes to issue any writ under the act, it was necessary that the corporation, who were to receive the money, should appoint some person to demand and receive it on their behalf. They accordingly, by resolution in council, appointed their chamberlain to demand and receive from the persons named in the commissioners' report the sums therein also mentioned (and among these from the plaintiff the amount of $437). The defendants themselves gave evidence of this appointment and of a demand made thereunder. The object of this evidence was plainly to rely upon it under the defendant's plea of justification, in which the corporation joined with their officer Sandall, as warranting the issue of the writ under which the plaintiff was arrested. We see, by the law relating to the duties of the officer who signed this writ, that he is under the control of the corporation, who have authority to order and direct the mode in which he shall execute his duties. It was proved also, that the corporation had in their possession the assessment roll of that same year, which, upon reference to it, shows that the plaintiff was not the owner, or occupant of, or assessed for, any property on Canterbury street. They had the means, therefore, in their possession of knowing that the report of the commissioners, in setting down the plaintiff as the owner of the lot in question, which they estimated to be benefited by the opening of Canterbury street to the amount of $437, was erroneous We find also, that after the plaintiff's arrest, and while he was in custody, the above amount was paid under protest to the corporation, who not only received it, but to this day retain it under a claim of a right to receive and retain it under the statute relied upon in their plea of justification. We find also, that the plaintiff was detained in custody until the above sum was paid to the corporation, and until they, by their officer, in their chamberlain's office, gave a receipt therefor, and authorized thereupon the discharge of the plaintiff from custody. Under these circumstances, the jury was perfectly justified in renduring their verdict against the corporation jointly with the defendant Sandall, and the, charge of the learned Chief Justice who tried the case to the jury upon the trespass count was unexceptionable. Indeed, it being established that the act relied upon as a justification of the plaintiff's arrest did not warrant his arrest, its having taken place is upon the evidence explicable only as the act of the corporation through their officer, who is under their control, and for the purpose of compelling thereby payment to the corporation by the plaintiff of the amount received from him, and which he was not legally liable to pay. The corporation have also, in effect, made their authority for, and consent to, the plaintiff's discharge conditional upon their receipt of the money levied from him by force of his illegal arrest; and this is the view which, it appears to me, the jury rightly and naturally took of the matter. The corporation, I can well believe, thought, as indeed was their main contention at the trial, that they were justified under the act in availing themselves of this extraordinary and exceptional process to enforce payment to them of the 1882 amount which they received, but in this we are bound to say they mistook the law, and come within the scope of the maxim ignorantia legis non excusat.\nAllow appeal with costs and order judgment to be entered in the court below upon the verdict Hunt pro Gwynne, J. tune if necessary\u2014that is of the term in which the verdict was rendered before the death of Sandall.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 20 New Brunswick Reports (4 P. & B.) 479.\n[2] L.

Any interference by owners with certain works under control of deputy slide master at Arnprior station, or with duties of that officer, to subject owner not duly authorized to a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred dollars over and above amount awarded by Superintendent of Ottawa works for any damage arising from such interference or violation of orders.\n8. That at time of damage and loss sustained by suppliants, they were lumbering on Madawaska river, owned licenses to cut timber on crown lands bordering on that river, had cut logs there which it was necessary to float down that river to Ottawa river, on way to Quebec, in usual manner.\n9. That such timber in course of transit passed over certain slides, booms and river improvements belonging to Her Majesty, viz: the retaining boom at Arnprior, the slide at Arnprior and the main retaining boom at the mouth of the Madawaska river in the river Ottawa, (Chat's lake).\n10. That suppliants had notified slide master, obtained permission to pass the timber and performed all conditions on their part to entitle them to have timber passed.\n11. That one John Harvey was duly appointed slide master, and had control and management of works over which timber passed.\n12. That the said timber and logs were passed from the retaining boom at the village of Arnprior over the said timber slide at said village into the main retaining boom in the Ottawa river (Chat's lake) by the said Harvey, whose duty it was, under the said orders, to direct and control the passage of the same, and by other servants of the Crown under his directions; and by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper manner in which this duty was performed by the said Harvey and the said other servants of the Crown, a larger quantity of timber and logs than the said main boom was capable of holding was allowed to pass over the said slide into the said main boom, and in consequence thereof the said boom broke away, and the timber and logs of the suppliants floated out of the same.\n13. That the suppliants repeatedly objected to so much of the timber and so many of the logs being passed over the said slide by the said slide master, and frequently warned the said slide master that the consequence would be that the boom would break away, as it did; but the said slide master ignored and refused to heed the objections and warnings of the suppliants.\n14. The suppliants also charged that the said boom at the mouth of the Madawaska was negligently and unskilfully constructed, and was wholly insufficient for the purpose it was designed to serve.\n15. The suppliants charged that the said slide master was incompetent to discharge the duties he was employed to discharge in connection with the said works, by reason, as well of his want of knowledge of the duties required of him in his said capacity of slide master, as at the said time and for some time preceding, of his intemperate habits, as was well known to Her Majesty, and that Her Majesty did not exercise due and proper care in the employment of the said slide master, and in continuing to employ him.\nThe petition then alleged that a great many of the pieces that floated away were lost to suppliants, they suffered loss on collecting those not lost; many of the pieces were injured and depreciated in value, and by reason of the delay of getting timber not lost to the market, they suffered a heavy loss, and they claimed $5,967.04 and interest.\n19. The suppliants submitted, that under the said statutes, the said Orders in Council, and the facts as above set forth, Her Majesty was and should be declared to be liable for the losses sustained by the suppliants, and for the labor and expense they were at by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the said slide master in passing the said timber and logs, the particulars of which were set forth in the paper thereto annexed marked \"A.\"\nThe suppliants therefore prayed that Her Majesty might under the said statutes, Orders in Council, and the facts as above set forth, be declared to be liable to the suppliants for the losses sustained by the suppliants, and for the labor and expense they were at by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the said slide master as aforesaid.\nTo this petition the Attorney-General, on behalf of Her Majesty, demurred on the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That no liability existed on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants, in respect of which a petition of right could be maintained for the losses alleged to have been sustained through the negligence of the persons mentioned in said petition, the Crown not being liable for the negligence of its servants.\n2. That no contract with the suppliants on the part of Her Majesty was shewn, and a petition of right does not lie to recover damages not arising under a contract with the Crown.\n3. That no liability on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants existed by reason of the insufficiency of the boom referred to in the said petition.\n4. That no liability on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants exists by reason of any want of care in the selection or employment of the slide master referred to in said petition.\n5. That under the statute in that behalf, the public works referred to in the petition were placed under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, and Her Majesty was not liable for the negligence of the persons having charge of said works.\nThe demurrer was argued in the Exchequer Court for the suppliants by Mr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., and Mr. McIntyre; and for the Crown by Mr Lash, Q. C.\nOn the 25th of May, 1881, the following judgment overruling the demurrer, was delivered by Henry, J.:\u2014\n\"This is an action brought by the plaintiffs by a petition of right to recover damages for losses sustained by them through the breaking of a boom in the Ottawa river situated below the timber slides at or near to Arnprior, by means of which several logs of the plaintiffs were wholly lost and the plaintiffs put to trouble and expense in recovering others, all, as alleged, through the improper and negligent conduct of John Harvey, who then was, and had been for some years before, slide master at that place duly appointed by the government, under the provisions of ch. 28 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada and of the Act 31st. Vic., ch. 12.\n\"To this petition a demurrer was filed and served on behalf of the Attorney-General, setting out as causes of demurrer in substance,\n\"1st. That Her Majesty is not liable for the losses sustained through the negligence of the Slide Master under the circumstances as alleged in the petition.\n\"2nd. That no contract with the suppliants is shown.\n\"3rd. That no liability on the part of Her Majesty exists by reason of the insufficiency of the boom referred to in the petition.\n\"4th. That Her Majesty is not liable by reason of any want of care in the selection or employment of the Slide Master.\n\"5th. Because the public works in question were placed by the statute under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, Her Majesty is not liable for the negligence of the persons having charge of said works under him.\n\"The demurrer admits all the allegations contained in the petition.\n\"The first cause of demurrer would, in my opinion, be sustainable if the action was founded solely on a tort. That it is a defence in this case largely if not altogether depends upon the fact whether the dealing with the logs in question created a contract. That I will now proceed to consider. The property in the public works in question is vested in the Queen as the head of the government and legislature of the Dominion. Public moneys were spent to erect and maintain the works. Tolls for the use of them were imposed. A slide master always managed and controlled the use of them. When logs reached the retaining boom' at Arnprior above the slides, he assumed the possession of them and the conduct of them through the slides and into the boom below them, from which they were re-delivered to the owners. By Orders in Council, under the acts, tolls were levied and collected and paid into the public treasury. No logs could get down the river without coming through the slides, and the legislature by the acts before referred to, provided the slides and the other works connected with them as the only means of passage for logs, To obtain the use of such works it became necessary for the owners of logs to transfer the actual temporary possession and control of them to the slide master to be retained by him until he re-delivered them out of the lower boom. There was in this case not only a voluntary, but under the circumstances an absolutely necessary transfer of the logs to the slide master for the purposes of transit. All control over the direction of the operation was out of the owners and in the slide master, and the suppliants complain that, whilst so, through the improper and negligent conduct of the slide master and the insufficiency of the lower boom, the loss complained of was occasioned.\n\"To test the objection that no contract existed, let a private individual or chartered company occupy the place of Her Majesty. Suppose the works in question to be private property, and the owner of logs by causing them to enter the retaining boom for transmission virtually delivers them to the agent or the owner of the slide for that purpose.\n\"By the act he impliedly agrees that if they are so transmitted he will pay the accustomed charges for the service, and if the other takes possession of them he adopts the offer and enters into a contract to transmit them in a proper manner and re-deliver them to the owner from the lower boom.\n\"If then through the improper conduct of the owner of the slides his agents or servants he is prevented from so re-delivering them, can it be contended there was no contract, and therefore no breach or liability. If then the legislature has thought proper to invest the government with carrying powers for the transmission of logs by water why should not a private individual have a remedy for a failure to perform obligations and duties in the exercise of such powers as he would have against a private contractor, and why should he not have redress in the same mode and on the same principle that he might do for the breach of duty in regard to the carriage of goods by means of a government railway? If, for instance, goods for transmission from one place to another are delivered to and received by the proper officers of the Intercolonial Railway, there arises a contract to deliver them accordingly, and if lost or destroyed would it not be evidence of an improper state of the law if the government would not be bound to make good the loss by means of a petition of right, there being no statutory exemption from such liability. The principles of the common law, which provide that where parties enter into a contract they are in every case bound by its terms express or implied, are applicable.\n\"A good many cases were cited at the hearing to establish the position that an action by petition of right cannot be maintained for negligence not arising out of a contract, but for damages arising from breaches of duty otherwise; but I need not refer to them as the claim here arises from the alleged failure to perform a contract. The English cases to which my attention has been turned give little aid in the determination of this one, as none that I can find is exactly applicable. The property in the public works in question was by the acts vested in the Queen\u2014not as personal to her, but in trust for the dominion\u2014the management and control being vested in the government of the dominion and the operations to be conducted by persons appointed by the government, or what is the same, by the Minister of Public Works. The funds for their erection and maintenance were provided to come from the public chest and the earnings to be paid into it. It is not necessary to enquire whether the investment has been found profitable or otherwise. An examination of the profit and loss account might shew either result, but it would not affect the liability. The erection of the slides and connecting works was no doubt principally undertaken as an improvement of the river for the public benefit, and if they were of such a character that they might be utilized by the public without charge and without being obliged to transfer the custody and care of private property in the course of transmission to the government's agents there would be then good reason to contend that if losses occurred they should be borne by those who suffered them without any recourse, but when, on the contrary, the government, through its appointees and agents, take charge of property for a special purpose, there is an implied contract to provide the necessary means to effect that purpose, in the same way as a private party would be required to do. It is therefore answerable in my opinion in this case, for the improper and negligent conduct of the slide master and for any negligence in keeping in use imperfect and insufficient booms or other appliances.\n\"The petition of right is founded on a violation of some right in respect of which, but for the immunity from all process with which the laws surrounds the sovereign, a suit at law or in equity could be sustained. The petition must shew on the face of it some ground of complaint which but for the inability of the subject to sue the sovereign may be made the subject of judicial procedure.\n\"In Feather v. The Queen[1], it was held that the 'cases in which the petition of right is open to the subject, are where the lands or goods or money of a subject have found their way into the possession of the Crown, and the purpose of the petition is to obtain restitution, or if restitution cannot be given compensation in money, or where the claim arises out of a contract, as for goods supplied to the Crown or to the public service.' According to the doctrine just cited a petition of right will lie for the breach of the contract in this case.\n\"By section 58 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, it is provided that this court 'shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases in which the demand shall be made or relief sought in respect to any matter which might in England be the subject of a suit or action in the Court of Exchequer on its revenue side against the Crown or any officer of the Crown.' This provision was subsequently amended by striking out the concluding words 'or any officer of the Crown.'\n\"As therefore an action, by petition of right founded on a contract with the government can be maintained in England, it is maintainable here under the provision of the statute I have just quoted. I am, for the reasons given, of the opinion that the petition of right in this case is properly founded.\n\"I therefore decide that the demurrer is bad and give judgment for the suppliants with costs.\"\nOn the 30th September, 1881, motion was made by the counsel for Her Majesty, pursuant to rule No. 231 of the Exchequer Court Rules and of the practice of the said court for an order nisi calling upon the suppliants to shew cause why the judgment rendered by this court in favor of the suppliants upon the hearing of the demurrer of the defendant to the suppliants' petition of right, should not be set aside and judgment entered for the Crown upon the following grounds:\u2014\n\"1. That no liability exists on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants in respect of which a petition of right can be maintained for the losses alleged to have been sustained through the negligence of the persons mentioned in said petition, the Crown not being liable for the negligence of its servants.\n\"2. That no contract with the suppliants on the part of Her Majesty is shewn, and a petition of right does not lie to recover damages not arising under a contract with the Crown.\n\"3. That no liability on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants exists by reason of the insufficiency of the boom referred to in the said petition.\n\"4. That no liability on the part of Her Majesty towards the suppliants exists by reason of any want of care in the selection or employment of the slide master referred to in said petition. \"5. That under the statute in that behalf, the public works referred to in the petition are placed under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, and Her Majesty is not liable for the negligence of the persons having charge of said works.\"\nThis motion was refused From this decision the Crown appealed.\nMr. Lash, Q.C., for appellant:\n1. There is no contract shewn. Whatever duty may exist on the part of the Crown towards those using the boom, such duty does not arise out of contract and no claim for damages by reason of the breach of this duty can be enforced by petition of right. The elements of a contract are wanting. There is no consensus. The rights of the parties are declared by statute and Orders in Council having the force of statute.\nIt has been said that there is a quasi contract between the Crown and those using the boom, but a quasi contract is not a contract and has not the necessary elements of one[2].\nAs to the duty of a Canal Company with respect to the management of their canal, see Parnaby v. Lancaster Canal Company[3]. In this case it was not suggested that the duty arose out of contract.\nSee also Gibbs v. Trustees of the Liverpool Docks[4], where, had the claim been treated as arising out of contract, the demurrer must necessarily have been overruled, whereas it was allowed.\nIn that case the defendants were a corporation owning the Liverpool docks and having power to impose tolls upon vessels navigating the port and using the docks, but by statute the control and management of the docks, &c., were vested in a committee. By reason of the improper state of the entrance to the docks, the plaintiff's vessel in endeavouring to enter was injured. Judgment was given for the defendants on the ground that they were not liable for the improper acts of the committee, the committee itself only being liable. Had the case been treated as one of contract, this decision could not have been given, as if any contract existed it was one with the trustees and not with the committee.\nThe above judgment was reversed in the Exchequer Chamber[5], but not on the ground that a contract existed. The defendants agreed that the plaintiff should not be required to commence another action against the defendants on the record. See judgment of Mr. Justice Blackburn in same case on appeal to the House of Lords[6].\nThe learned judge in the Court below seems to have treated the case as if the Crown were a carrier of the logs and that the possession of the logs was given over to the Crown who impliedly contracted to redeliver them to the owner after their passage through the works, and that the Crown is liable for breach of contract in not so redelivering them. It is submitted that the learned Judge is wrong in holding that there was a delivery of the logs to the Crown to be carried through the works and redelivered to the suppliants. The suppliants themselves have the right as part of the public to use the works subject to the regulation made with respect to their use and the Crown is entitled to collect tolls upon the logs passing through the work. The suppliants' right to use the works does not depend upon an implied contract, as the learned Judge holds that they will pay the accustomed charges for the services rendered by the Crown. The right to collect the charges does not depend upon contract. It is a right given by statute to levy tolls upon certain articles quite irrespective of any contract. A Log driving and Boom Co., has been held in the U. S., not to be a carrier: Mann and White River L. & B. Co. Mich., S. C., referred to in Albany Law Journal[7].\nIt is submitted that the fallacy in the learned judge's argument in this respect consists in holding that the Crown undertook to do anything with respect to the suppliants' logs - the true position is that the suppliants themselves made use of the public work in question and had the right under the law so to do, irrespective of any consent or contract on the part of the Crown, provided that when using it they complied with the law, viz.: the regulations for its use. Morgan v. Ravey[8].\nIn view of the decisions of this court with respect to the claims which may be enforced by petition of right it seems hardly necessary to refer to any authorities for the position that a petition of right lies only when the claim sought to be enforced is upon contract, but for convenience of reference the following cases are alluded to: Thomas v. The Queen[9]; Tobin v. The Queen[10]; Jones v. The Queen, judgment of Sir William Ritchie, Exchequer Court of Canada; and Halifax City Railway v. The Queen, judgment of Sir William Richards, Exchequer Court of Canada[11].\nBut assuming that there is a contract in this case it is submitted that the Crown is not liable for the negligence of the boom master or other servants of the Crown. See Viscount Canterbury v. Attorney General[12].\nThis case is confirmed by Thomas v. The Queen, Tobin v. The Queen, Jones v. The Queen, and Halifax City Railway v. The Queen, above mentioned. There is no pretence that any action can be maintained against the Crown by petition of right for negligence in the selection of its servants It is not pretended that any contract existed between the Crown and the suppliants, that the Crown would use care in the selection of its servants: Viscount Canterbury v. Attorney General[13].\nThe suppliants have alleged that the boom was unskilfully constructed and was insufficient for the purposes it was designed to serve, but the petition does not state that such was the cause of the damage, and the prayer of the petition is confined to the loss sustained by the suppliants by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the boom master. If, however, it might be held that the suppliants may rely upon this statement it is submitted that the general principles above alluded to, show that the duty (if any) on the part of the Crown to construct the boom skilfully does not arise out of contract.\nIt cannot be pretended that there was any contract with the suppliants at the time the boom was constructed, and any duty which might arise towards them by reason of the insufficiency of the boom did not arise out of contract.\nThere are many duties which the Crown owes towards its subjects for breach of which the Crown should in fairness make compensation, but it is one thing to say that the Crown should make compensation, and quite a different thing to say that the suppliants are entitled to enforce their claim by petition of right. The suppliants are not entirely without remedy. The Statute 38 Vic. (1870) ch. 23, providing for a reference to the official arbitrators of certain claims against the Crown expressly covers the claim in this case, and it is submitted that the suppliants have no other remedy but that provided for by that statute.\nIt is also submitted that the fifth ground of the demurrer is valid.\nParagraphs 4, 7 and 11 of the petition, and the Act 31st Vic. (1867, Canada) ch. 12, and the old Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 28, show that the control and management of the boom in question were vested in the Department of Public Works.\nIt is contended by the suppliants that the Minister of Public Works is merely the agent of Her Majesty and that Her Majesty is liable for his acts.\nIt is true that the Minister of Public Works is in one sense the agent of Her Majesty, but with respect to the works placed under his control by statute he is not the agent of Her Majesty in the sense that makes Her Majesty responsible under the maxim respondeat superior. As the officer having the control and management of the work he is appointed by Parliament and not by Her Majesty. The statute vests the control and management of the work in the Minister irrespective of Her Majesty's desire in the premises. The Crown may refrain from appointing a Minister of Public Works, but if one be appointed he becomes by force of the statute clothed with control of the works, and so long as the statute is in force his powers under it cannot be interfered with. Therefore, deriving his powers from a statute and not because they are given to him by the Crown, Her Majesty cannot be made responsible by petition of right for the improper exercise of those powers. See Gibbs v. Trustees of the Liverpool Docks[14]; Viscount Canterbury v. Attorney General[15]; Hall V. Smith[16]; Duncan v. Findlater[17]. Mr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. McIntyre, for respondents.\nThe facts alleged in the several paragraphs of the petition which are admitted by the demurrer, and are to be found summarized in the judgment of Mr. Justice Henry, constitute an implied contract on the part of the Crown with the respondents, for the passage of the timber and logs of the respondents over the slide at Arnprior, into the retaining boom in the river Ottawa, at the mouth of the Madawaska river, rendering the Crown liable, as a common carrier, upon any breach of said contract. Smith's Merc. Law[18]; Simpson v. London General O. Coy.[19]; Richardson v. The Great Eastern Ry. Co.[20].\nBut even if these facts did not raise a contract between the respondents and the Crown, as a common carrier, with its corresponding liabilities, they at any rate constitute an implied contract upon the part of the Crown, with the respondents, to use due and reasonable skill and care in passing the timber and logs of the respondents over the said slide into the said boom. Addison on Contracts[21]; Leake on Contracts[22]; Morgan v. Ravey[23]; Dugdale v. Lovering[24]; Marzetti v. Williams[25]; Redhead v. Midland Ry. Co.[26]; Mr. Justice Blackburn's remarks in that case citing Brown v. Edgington[27]; Addison on Torts[28]; Brown v. Boorman[29].\nThat a petition of right will lie to enforce an implied contract against the Crown cannot be denied.\nThe case of Churchward v. The Queen[30], in which case it is admitted in all the judgments that if the suppliant could hare established an implied contract with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, representing the Crown, his petition would have been successful, is an authority. Feather v. The Queen[31]; Thomas v. Queen[32]; and this also has been held by the Exchequer Court here in Wood v. Queen and Isbester v. Queen, E. C. of Can., which judgments were not appealed[33]; see also secs. 58 and 61, 31 Vic., c. 12.\nHer Majesty as the representative of the Executive Government of Canada is liable on the implied contract to the respondents and is properly sued for a breach of the same as the management of said works by the Minister of Public Works referred to in the 5th paragraph of the Attorney General's demurrer is the management by him as one of her superior servants. The property in these works is by the acts vested in the Queen not as personal to her, but in trust for the Dominion, the management and control being entrusted to the Minister of Public Works and other employees and servants of her Majesty; the funds for their construction and maintenance being provided to come from the public chest and the earnings to be paid into it. 31 Vic., c. 12, sees. 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 58, 61, 63, 65, 66. Thorne v. Commrs. of Public Works[34]; Churchward v. Queen; Thomas v. Queen; Wood v. Queen; Isbester v. Queen[35].\nThe learned counsel then referred to and distinguished the case of Parnaby v. The Lancaster Canal Co.[36]; Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[37]. The respondents rely upon the judgment of Mr. Justice Henry.\nRITCHIE, C.J., [after reading the statement of the case proceeded as follows:]\nThere is, in my opinion, no analogy whatever between this case and that of private individuals or corporations owning slides and undertaking by themselves or their agents to take charge of, and to pass, for a consideration, timber through such their private property. In such a case no one can doubt that if such timber was lost or damaged by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the proprietors or their servants in passing such timber through their slides, they would be responsible to the owners thereof for such loss.\nBut this, in my opinion, is an entirely different case, governed by principles wholly inapplicable to that just suggested. The Queen, not being a private individual, is not subject to the liabilities of private individuals.\nThe slides, booms and property in question are not private property but public property, created by the expenditure of public money for public purposes and for the public benefit, and vested in Her Majesty, as the learned judge who heard this case justly remarks, \"not as personal to Her, but in trust for Her Dominion.\"\nThe management and control of this public property is through the instrumentality of orders of the Governor General in Council, and the operations in connection therewith are conducted by persons appointed by a high officer of state, the Minister of Public Works, under whose general management the public works of the Dominion are placed. The river in its natural state was evidently unfitted for the transport of the timber in the great lumbering district through which it passed, and \"to advance the public good,\" and to make the river fit for the transportation of timber, so that by its improvement it might be made a great highway for the development of a great Dominion industry, public property and public works, such as these, were required; and the liability of Her Majesty in reference thereto cannot for a moment be placed on the same footing or governed by the same principles as private property in which private individuals invest their capital for their private gain.\nI am of opinion there was no contract or breach of contract to give to the suppliants any claim against the Crown, nor do the suppliants put forward their claim to relief on any such ground. The claim set forth in the petition is a tort pure and simple.\nThere is no allegation that the suppliants had any contract with the Crown; there is no allegation of any breach of any contract on the part of the Crown. The allegation in paragraph 12 is that Harvey, whose duty it was to direct and control the passage of the lumber, \"by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper manner in which this duty was performed by him,\" the boom broke away and the timber floated out of the same. By paragraph 15: \"That the slide master was incompetent to discharge his duties, as well by reason of want of knowledge as, at the said time and for some time preceding, of his intemperate habits, as was well known to Her Majesty, and that Her Majesty did not exercise due and proper care in the employment of the said slide master and in continuing to employ him.\" And by section 19 the suppliants distinctly ask that Her Majesty shall be declared liable for the losses they have sustained \"by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the said slide master in passing the said timber and logs,\" and they put forward no contract, breach of contract or other ground whatever. And in the prayer in like manner they pray that Her Majesty may be declared liable \"by reason of the unskilful, negligent and improper conduct of the said slide master.\" So that they rest their claim solely and entirely on the negligent and improper conduct of the slide master; on his intemperate habits; on the knowledge of Her Majesty of those intemperate habits and on a charge that with such knowledge Her Majesty \"did not exercise due and proper care in the employment of the said slide master, and in continuing to employ him.\" This last amounting simply to a charge that Her Majesty carelessly and improperly exercised Her Royal Prerogative.\nNow clearly all this claim is based on an injury sustained by a wrong properly so called, and it is clear beyond all dispute that a petition of right in respect of a wrong in the legal sense of the term shews no right to legal redress against the sovereign.\nBut it is said that the Crown was, as to this timber in passing through the slides, a common carrier, and as such the relation of the Crown to the owners of such timber is in the nature of and to be treated as a contract between man and man. But to my mind there is not the slightest analogy between this case and a common carrier; these improvements made for the benefit and convenience of the public are vested in the Crown in trust for the public, and their management and direction is entrusted to certain officers appointed in accordance with statutory provisions.\nIt has been repeatedly held that there is no analogy in the case of the postmaster and a common carrier. If the post office department cannot be considered in the light of common carriers, I am at a loss to conceive how it is possible to establish in a case such as this that the Crown is a common carrier.\nLord Mansfield, in Whitfield v. Lord Le Despencer[38], treats the post office as a branch of the revenue and a branch of police created by act of parliament; he says:\nas a branch of police, it puts the whole correspondence of the kingdom (for the exceptions are trifling) under government and entrusts the management and direction of it to the Crown and officers appointed by the Crown. There is no analogy, therefore, between the case of the postmaster and a common carrier.\nLord Mansfield at page 765 points out that an action on the case lies against parties really offending, &c., that is, that all inferior officers are responsible for their personal negligence.\nIn Rowning v. Goodchild[39], an action against a deputy postmaster for non-delivery of letters, as to duty of postmaster De Grey, C.J., says:\nThis is not to be considered in the nature of a private contract between man and man, nor is the postmaster to be looked upon (as urged at the bar) in the light of a common carrier. But the duty arises out of a great public trust since the legislative establishment of the post office by the statutes of Charles II. and Queen Anne.\nChancellor Kent says[40]:\u2014\nIt has been the settled law in England, since the case of Lane v. Cotton[41], that the rule respecting common carriers does not apply to postmasters, and there is no analogy between them. The post office establishment is a branch of the public police, created by statute, and the government have the management and control of the whole concern. The postmasters enter into no contract with individuals, and receive no hire, like common carriers, in proportion to the risk and value of the letters under their charge, but only a general compensation from government. In the case referred to the postmaster-general was held not to be answerable for the loss of exchequer bills stolen out of a letter while in the defendant's office. The subject was again elaborately discussed in Whitefield v. Lord Le Despencer[42], and the same doctrine asserted. The postmaster-general was held not to be responsible for a bank note stolen, by one of the sorters, out of a letter in the post office. But a deputy postmaster or clerk in the office is still answerable in a private suit, for misconduct or negligence; as, for wrongfully detaining a letter an unreasonable time. The English law on this subject was admitted in Dunlop v. Munroe[43] to be the law of the United States; and a postmaster was considered to be liable in a private action for damages arising from misfeasance or for negligence, or want of ordinary diligence in his office, in not safely transmitting a letter[44]. Whether he was liable himself for the negligence of his clerks or assistants was a point not decided; though if he were so to be deemed responsible in that case, it would only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge of his duty in his office.\nThe most that can be said of this case is that the legislature has improved this river and rendered it navigable, giving the public the use of it so improved on complying with certain regulations and paying certain tolls wholly independent of contract. If, in using the river and so availing themselves of the government improvements, their property should be lost or injured by the improper conduct of the servants of the government or any other person, doubtless for any such wrong the law would furnish a remedy against the party whose wrongful conduct occasioned the injury, for I suppose it will scarcely be doubted that inferior officers are responsible for their personal negligence.\nIf the judgment in this case is allowed to stand it would be a direct adjudication that the Crown was not only responsible in damages for wrongs done by her servants, but also responsible in damages to her subjects for not exercising due and proper care in the exercise of her royal prerogative, that is to say: in the employment of this slide master, and in continuing to employ him, well knowing his intemperate habits and consequent unfitness for the situation.\nAs to the first, in contemplation of law the sovereign can do no wrong and is not liable for the consequences of her own personal negligence, so she cannot be made answerable for the tortious acts of her servants The doctrine of respondeat superior has no application to the Crown, it being a rule of the common law that the Crown cannot be prejudiced by the wrongful acts of any of its officers, for as has been said long ago, no laches can be imputed to the sovereign. \"nor is there any reason that the king should suffer by the negligence of his officers or by their compacts or combination with the adverse party.\"\nAs to the second, the allegation in the petition attempts to make Her Majesty amenable to her subjects in her courts for the proper exercise of her prerogatival rights and amounts to a direct and unwarrantable attack on Her Majesty's prerogative rights and is derogatory to the honor of her Crown and an imputation that ought not in my opinion to be permitted to appear on the records of this court.\nAnd while it has been determined in the United States[45] that the maxim that the King can do no wrong has no place in the system of constitutional law as applicable either to the government or to any of its officers, it has been held that the restriction of the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to cases of contract express or implied has reference to the well understood distinction between cases arising ex contractu and ex delicto, and is founded on the sound principle that while Congress was willing to subject the government to suits on valid contracts which would only be valid when made by some one vested with the authority to do so, or something done by such authority which raised an implied contract, it did not intend to make the government liable for the wrongful and unauthorized acts of its officers, however high their place, and though done under a mistaken zeal for the public good.\nIt is unnecessary to cite authorities to show a petition of right will not lie to recover compensation for a wrongful act done by a servant of the Crown in the supposed performance of his duty, inasmuch as a petition will not lie for a claim founded upon a tort on the ground that the Crown can do no wrong. The cases of Tobin v. Reg.[46], and Feather v. Reg.[47], Viscount Canterbury v. Attorney General[48], sufficiently establish this if authority was needed.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. The well-known case of Lord Canterbury v. The Queen[49] establishes that the Crown is not liable for injuries occasioned by the negligence of its servants or officers, and that the rule respondeat superior does not apply in respect of the wrongful or negligent acts of those engaged in the public service. The case of Lane v. Cotton[50] had in effect decided this, it having there been determined that the great officers of the Crown were not liable for the acts of subordinate officers whom they might employ to assist them in the execution of their offices. That was an action against the Postmaster-General, in which the plaintiff sought to recover for the negligence of a clerk in the post office\u2014who was the officer of the Postmaster-General and not of the Crown\u2014in losing a letter; it was held on principles of public policy that the defendant was not liable. Lord Chief Justice Holt dissented from the judgment, but it was afterwards held to be law by Lord Mansfield and the whole Court of Queen's Bench in the case of Whitfield v. Le Despencer[51]. This exemption was founded upon the general ground that the Postmaster General was a public officer, and that the whole establishment of the post office being for public purposes, and the officers employed therein being appointed under public authority, it would be against public policy to make the head of the department liable for the acts of his subordinate officers, though employed by him and actually in his service and not in that of the Crown, since it would be impracticable for him to supervise all their acts. If, therefore, the officers of the Crown are not thus responsible, it must follow a fortiori that the Crown itself cannot be liable, and such has been the course of decision not only in England, where Lord Canterbury's case is decisive of the principle, but also in the United States, for the exemption is rested entirely on grounds of public policy. The law is well stated by Mr. Justice Story in the following extract from his Commentaries on the Law of Agency:\nIt is plain that the government itself is not responsible for the misfeasances, wrongs, negligences or omissions of duty of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service; for it does not undertake to guarantee to any persons the fidelity of any of the officers or agents whom it employs; since that would involve it, in all its operations, in endless embarrassments and difficulties and losses which would be subversive of the public interests, and indeed laches are never imputable to the government.\nIn Gibbons v. U. S.[52], Mr. Justice Miller, in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the U. S. says:\nBut it is not to be disguised that this case is an attempt under the assumption of an implied contract to make the government responsible for the unauthorized acts of its officers, those acts being in themselves torts. No government has ever held itself liable to individuals for the misfeasance, laches or unauthorized exercise of power by its officers and agents. And again,\nThe general principle which we have already stated as applicable to all governments forbids, on a policy imposed by necessity, that they should hold themselves liable for unauthorized wrongs inflicted by their officers on the citizen, though occuring while engaged in the discharge of official duty.\nThis doctrine is indeed not confined to an exoneration of the Crown from liability for the torts of its agents and servants, but is carried so far as to exonerate the Crown or government from the non-performance of contractual obligations, which in the case of private persons would be fatal to their rights, when such nonperformance or negligence consists in the omissions of public officers to perform their duties[53]. A strong instance of this is afforded in the case of the neglect of the officer of the Crown to give notice of dishonor of a bill or note taken under an extent, which is held not to prejudice the right of the Crown to recover against the drawer or endorser. And the reason for this is said by Sir John Byles in his work on Bills of Exchange to be the principle already stated, that the laches of its officers is not to be imputed to the Crown.\nThe learned judge who heard this case in the Exchequer Court has placed his judgment on the ground that the petition of right shows a breach of contract on the part of the Crown, that the Crown contracted to pass the suppliants' timber safely through the slides, and that, being liable for breach of contract though not for the torts of its servants, its liability in the present case is analogous to that of a carrier who can be sued for breach of contract arising from the defaults of his servants and agents. Without enquiring whether this analogy between the liability of the Crown and a private person for a breach of contract arising from the laches and negligence of an agent is correctly assumed, it appears very clear that there is no room for applying it in the present case, for the petition of right does not show any contract on the part of the Crown, to pass the timber safely through the slides, either expressly or impliedly entered into by the parties, as in the case of a carrier undertaking the carriage of goods, or arising by operation of law. At the most it shows a duty on the part of the slide master to take due and proper care, and alleges a state of facts which, in the case of a private owner of a slide, would make him liable for the omission of such care arising from the negligence of his servant or agent, but for which in the case of the Crown there is not, for the reasons and on the authorities already stated, any responsibility. The consequence is that the only remedy open to the suppliants for the wrong of which they complain was an action against the slide master[54].\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court must be reversed with costs, and judgment on the demurrer entered for the Crown with costs.\nHENRY, J., adhered to his judgment rendered by him in the Exchequer Court.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nIt was admitted by the learned counsel for the suppliants that upon the authority of Viscount Canterbury v. Attorney General[55] and Tobin v. Regina[56], a petition of right will not lie against Her Majesty for any tort or negligence committed by any person in the employment of the Crown. The losses in respect of which the suppliants claim compensation are, in the petition in this case, alleged to have been occasioned by the \"unskilful negligent and improper conduct\" of a slide master, at one of the slides constituting part of the public works of the Dominion, and who is alleged to have been duly appointed to his office under the provisions of ch. 28 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada and the Dominion Statute 31 Vic., ch. 12. But although it was admitted that Her Majesty could not be made responsible for any injury occasioned to the suppliants by the negligence of such slide master, it was contended that indirectly Her Majesty could be made responsible for the negligence by implying a contract made between the suppliants and Her Majesty through the medium of the slide master, to the effect that in consideration of the tolls to be paid by the suppliants for their logs passing through the slide Her Majesty would become a carrier of the logs and would convey them through the slide and would deliver them safely to the suppliants after having passed through the slide. It would be sufficient in this case to say that no such case is made by the petition, which plainly rests the suppliants claim upon the alleged unskilful negligent and improper conduct of the slide master. But in truth if Her Majesty's nonliability in case of tort and negligence could be gotten over by such a novel and ingenious device, it would be idle to say that there existed that exemption which is admitted in cases of tort and negligence. No authority was cited in support of this novel proposition, nor can it be supported upon any principle. Her Majesty was not a carrier of the logs for hire and reward, nor has the slide master any authority whatever to make an express contract which would be binding on Her Majesty, either of the nature of a contract for carriage for reward or of any other nature. The petition alleges, as the fact is, that although the slide at which the alleged loss and damage to the suppliant occurred, as a public work of the dominion, is vested in Her Majesty, it is by statute placed under the control of the Minister of Public Works, by whom, and not by Her Majesty, the slide master is appointed and removed; and he, upon his appointment, acquires, in virtue of the provisions of the statute in that behalf, and the Orders in Council made in pursuance thereof, the control and management of the slide of which he is appointed slide master or superintendent in subordination to the Minister. He is not a servant or agent of Her Majesty at all. The Minister of Public Works himself comes within the description mentioned in 1 Ph 323-4 of a public officer appointed to perform certain duties assigned to him by the legislature, and the slide master is a subordinate public officer also appointed to perform certain duties in like manner attached to his office. The tolls which the suppliants pay for their logs passing through the slide are not paid as the consideration for any service or duty undertaken by Her Majesty, but by force of the statute which imposes the tolls upon all persons using the slide. The slide master has no power or authority other than such as is conferred upon him in virtue of his appointment under the authority of the statute. He has no authority to enter into any contract with any person using the slide. He is not placed in his office or appointment to make any contracts, but to perform statutory duties. If he neglect those duties he is himself responsible, but having no authority to enter into any express contract binding on Her Majesty no contract to affect her Majesty can be implied from any acts or conduct of his. The receipt therefore by him of tolls which it is his statutory duty to collect can afford no foundation from which any promise by Her Majesty can be implied. Between such a case and that of a promise being implied from the acts and conduct of private persons capable of entering into express contracts, either by themselves or their agents duly authorised for the particular purpose, there is not that I can see any analogy; all the acts of the slide master must come either within the class of those acts which are authorized by force of the statute, or within that of those which are not so authorized. In respect of the former, the statute is his sole authority and at the same time his justification, and her Majesty cannot be affected thereby: for such as come within the latter class he himself is alone responsible. If public opinion should think that some provision ought to be made by statute for the compensation of injuries occasioned by the misconduct of such a statutory officer, application should be made to the legislature and not to the courts. In the meantime the plaintiff must assert whatever remedy he has against the person whose misconduct causes the injury. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitors for respondent: Cockburn & McIntyre.\n[1] 6 B. & S. 294.\n[2] Maine's Ancient law, p. 344.\n[3] 11 A. & E. 223.\n[4] 1 H. & N. 230.\n[5] 3 H. & N. 439.\n[6] L.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nTrespass\u2014Registration\u2014Notice.\u2014Rev. Stats, N. S., 4 Series, c. 79, secs. 9 & 19.\nR. (the appellant) brought an action against H. (the respondent) for having erected a brick wall over and upon the upper part of the south wall or cornice of appellant's store, pierced holes, &c. H. pleaded, inter alia, special leave and license, and that he had done so for a valuable consideration paid by him, and an equitable rejoinder alleging that plaintiff and those through whom he claimed had notice of the defendant's title to this easement at the time they obtained their conveyances. In 1859 one C., who then owned R's property, granted by deed to H. the privilege of piercing the south wall, carrying his stovepipe into the flues, and erecting a wall above the south wall of the building to form at that height the north wall of respondent's building, which was higher than R's. R. purchased in 1872 the property from the Bank of Nova Scotia, who got it from one F., to whom C. had conveyed it\u2014all these conveyances being for valuable consideration. The deed from C. to H. was not recorded until 1871, and R's solicitor, in searching the title, did not search under C's name after the registry of the deed by which the title passed out of C. in 1862, and did not therefore observe the deed creating the easement in favor of plaintiff. There was evidence, when attention was called to it, that respondent had no separate wall, and the northern wall above appellant's building could be seen.\nHeld, That the continuance of illegal burdens on R's property since the fee had been acquired by him, were, in law, fresh and distinct trespasses against him, for which he was entitled to recover damages, unless he was bound by the license or grant of C. 2. That the deed creating the easement was an instrument requiring registration under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Registry Act, 4 series, Rev. Stats. N. S., ch. 79, secs. 9 & 19, and was defeated by the prior registration of the subsequent purchaser's conveyance for valuable consideration, and therefore from the date of the registration of the conveyance from N. to F., that the deed of grant to H. became void at law against F. and all those claiming title through him.\n3. That to defeat a registered deed there must be actual notice or fraud, and there was no actual notice given to R. in this case, such as to disentitle him to insist in equity on his legal priority acquired under the statute.\nPer Gwynne, J., dissenting: That upon the pleadings as they stood on the record, the question of the Registry Act did not arise, and that as the incumbrance complained of had been legally created in 1859, its mere continuance did not constitute a trespass, and that the action as framed should not be sustained.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making absolute a rule to set aside verdict for the appellant, and to enter a verdict and judgment thereon for the respondent. The facts and proceedings are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Thompson, Q.C., for appellant: The question in this case chiefly turns upon the Nova Scotia Registry Act, Rev. Stats. N.S. (4th series), ch. 79.\nIf the agreement from Caldwell to defendant is to be considered as a grant, or as a conveyance of the land or of any part of Caldwell's estate therein, I contend it comes under the operation of the Registry Act, and the conveyances from Caldwell to Nash, from Nash to Forman, and from Forman to the bank, took priority of it. In that case, Caldwell had no interest in the land at the time of recording the agreement, which could be bound by the agreement. The bank having taken a title free from any such encumbrance, conveyed to the plaintiff a title equally free. Wash, on Real Prop.[1]; Wade on Notice[2]; James Bates v. Amos Norcross[3]; John Lomes v. Brewer[4]; Trull v. Bigelow[5]; Rawle on Cov. for Title[6].\nThe only other defence left to the respondent is, that appellant had constructive notice, viz.:\u2014that the encroachment was so obvious that the plaintiff was bound to take notice of it. In the first place, I contend that the purchaser was not put on enquiry. The height of the buildings was such that the overlapping of the wall would not attract notice, but would only be observed by a person whose attention was called to it.\nThere is no evidence in the case that the chimneys of the Victoria block or the want of chimneys in the defendant's building was visible. Such may have been only visible from the roofs of the buildings, and in respect of this matter, at least the plaintiff had a right to damages and an injunction. On this point I will cite Allen v. Seckham[7]. It is only in equity that notice is a defence; and a purchaser without notice is protected in equity. Sugd. on Vend. & Pur.[8]; Doe dem. Robinson v. Allsop[9]; Doe dem. Nunn v. Lufkin[10].\nThe facts being found' for the plaintiff, the plaintiff was and is entitled to judgment.\nThe other two points on which I rely, as stated in my factum, are 1st\u2014that the plaintiff had no actual notice of the agreement or of the burden on the property. The registry of the agreement, out of its regular course, and at a period when the title to the property would not be searched for conveyances to or from Caldwell, was not actual or constructive notice. It was, in fact, a nullity. Hine v. Dodd[11]; Underwood v. Lord Courtown[12],\n2nd, If the agreement is to be considered a license, it is revocable, and was sufficiently revoked. Gale en Easements; 20.\nMr. Rigby, Q. C., for respondent: My first point is that under the pleadings, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of the Registry Act, as it was not set up in any of the replications. But if this Court holds that the pleadings are suffiicient, then I contend that this document does not come within the 19 sect, of Ch. 79, Rev. Stat., N.S., 4 series. No instruments are required to be registered except deeds, mortgages, judgments, attachments, leases and grants. Under 19th section deeds not registered shall be void against a subsequent purchaser, who shall first register his deed. In this case defendant had first registered the agreement; and it was, and for some time had been, on registry, previous to the purchase by plaintiff of his property.\nMy next point is: plaintiff had notice, both express and constructive, of defendant's easement in his said Wall. Express, by the said agreement between plaintiff and defendant registered for nearly two years before his purchase of his said property and also by its being patent to every one who looked at the two properties; constructive, by the fact that the only wall between the two buildings was one of a brick and a-half thick, by which as seen it appeared as a wall common to both parties, and as was also apparent by defendant's shop window. Wolseley v. Dematros[13]; Winter v. Brockwell[14]; McMechan v. Griffin[15]; Davis v. Sear[16]; Morland v. Cook[17]; Allen v. Seckham[18]; Dart V. & P.[19].\nThere could be no revocation of a license to do an act executed. Winter v. Brockwell[20]; Wallace v. Harrison[21]; Duke of Devonshire v. Elgin[22].\nThis was a license under a sealed instrument. Croker v. Cooper[23].\nThis was a license to an easement on the lands of another: Washburn on Easements[24]; Moody v. Steggles[25].\nEasements are not incumbrances Dart V. & P.[26].\nMr. Thompson, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was an action wherein the plaintiff claimed that he was lawfully possessed of a certain messuage and building situate on Hollis street, in the city of Halifax; that defendant wrongfully and injuriously erected and kept erected a building on Hollis street contiguous and adjoining to the messuage and building of plaintiff, and used and continues to use the wall of plaintiff's building for defendant's building, and pierced holes, &c., &c., and wrongfully and injuriously built a wall and projection in connection therewith over and upon the building and wall of plaintiff, and the same kept and continued for a long period of time, by reason whereof plaintiff's building was injured, &c.\nAnd he claims two thousand dollars damages.\nAnd the plaintiff also claims a writ of injunction to restrain the defendant from the continuance and repetition of the injuries above complained of in each and every of the said counts respectively, and from the committal of other injuries of a like kind relating to the same rights.\nThe defendant pleaded several pleas, but the seventh and eighth are the only ones which raise the questions in controversy in this case.\nThe seventh plea sets out that one Caldwell, being owner of the land now owned by plaintiff, by deed granted to defendant, and to his heirs and assigns, the right to make use of the south end wall of the building on said Caldwell's land, and granted the defendant the right to raise a new wall on the top of the south end, &c., by virtue of which deed defendant, before plaintiff became owner of said building and while Caldwell continued owner, made use of wall and raised said wall; and the said plaintiff: became the owner of said building, land, close and messuage, with notice of the said rights and easements of the defendant and subject thereto, and the defendant has ever continued since to enjoy and possess said rights and easements, and to use said Victoria block, and said south wall, chimney, roof and cornice in accordance with the terms of said deed and grant, and the alleged trespasses were or are an enjoyment by the defendant of the said rights and easements.\n\"8. And for an eighth plea to said declaration, first suggesting as aforesaid, and for a defence upon equitable grounds, the defendant says that long before the plaintiff became possessed of or entitled to the reversion in the said lands and premises, in the said declaration set forth, one Samuel Caldwell was the owner thereof, and of the said building known as the Victoria block, then and ever since standing thereon, and the south wall of said building was the northern boundary of a lot of land belonging to the defendant, and of which he then was, and ever since has been, the owner in fee. That the defendant, being desirous of pulling down the building then upon his said lot, and erecting thereon a new and more valuable building, and also being desirous of using the south end wall of said Victoria block as the north end wall of his said new building, as far as the same could be made available for such purposes, entered into an agreement under seal with the said Samuel Caldwell, on or about the twenty-second day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, which agreement is in the words following; that is to say:\u2014\n\"Memorandum of agreement, made the 22nd day of August, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, between Samuel Caldwell, of Halifax, Esquire, of the one part, and James Hunter, of the same place, gasfitter, of the other part. Whereas, the said James Hunter, lately purchased the lot of land, dwelling house and premises, situate in Hollis street, in the city of Halifax, joining the south end of the brick building called Victoria block, lately in the occupation and possession of Henry Pryor, Esquire, as an office, and by his tenants as a dwelling house, and the said James Hunter, being about to pull down the said dwelling house, and to erect on the site thereof a brick building, with an iron front, and four stories high, suitable for his trade and business. And where-as, the said Samuel Caldwell, as the owner of the said Victoria block, hath consented and agreed with the said James Hunter, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, to permit and allow the said James Hunter, his contractors, builders, and workmen, to make use of the south end or wall of the said Victoria building, in the erection of the said new store, so as to save to the said James Hunter the expense of a new wall or end to his new building about to be erected. Now, this agreement witnesseth that the said Samuel Caldwell, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, doth hereby covenant, promise, and agree to and with the said James Hunter, his executors, administrators, and assigns, in manner following; that is to say, that he, the said Samuel Caldwell, for and in consideration of the sum of seventy-five pounds currency, to him in hand paid by the said James Hunter, hereby agrees to permit and allow the said James Hunter, his contractors, builders, and workmen, to make use of the south end or wall of the brick building or Victoria block in every way that may be requisite and necessary, so as to save the said James Hunter the expense of a new north wall to his own building, and to pierce the end of the said wall to allow the ends of the timbers and joists of the new building to be inserted therein, and to use the said south end or wall of the Victoria block in all respects to the depth and height of the new building as if the said James Hunter had built a new north wall for his own building. And as it is intended that the new building shall be higher than the Victoria Block, it is further agreed by and between the said parties that the said James Hunter and his contractors and workmen may raise a new wall on the top of the south end or cornice of the said Victoria Block, and continue the same upwards, to the full height and depth of the said new building, and also to cut a hole or holes in the chimney now erected for stove pipes, and to have the right and privilege of using the same at all times hereafter for that purpose. The said James Hunter hereby agrees to raise the said chimney as high as may be necessary, and to make good the new wall on the top of the present finish or cornice of the Victoria block, and round the chimney, to prevent leakage, and further, that in the erection of the said new building, as little damage as possible shall be done to the south wall of the Victoria building, and that all holes or any other damage shall be filled up and made good by the said James Hunter. In witness whereof, the said parties have hereunto their hands and seals subscribed and set the day and year first above written.\"\n\"JAMES HUNTER, [L.S.]\n\"SAMUEL CALDWELL, [L.S.]\n\"Signed, sealed and delivered\nin the presence of\nWM. ROBINSON.\"\n\"And thereupon the said James Hunter, having paid the sum mentioned in said agreement as the consideration for the rights and easements thereby granted, pulled down the building then standing upon his said lot, and at a very large expense erected a new and valuable building thereon, adjoining said Victoria block, and made use of the said south end wall of Victoria block, in every way that was requisite and necessary so as to save the defendant the expense of a new north wall to his said building, and did pierce the end of the said wall to allow the ends of the timbers and joists of said new building to be inserted therein, and the same were inserted therein, and defendant used said south wall of Victoria block in all respects to the depth and height of his said new building, as if the defendant had built a new north wall for his building, and did raise a new wall on the top of the south cornice of the said Victoria block, and continued the same upwards to the full height and depth of defendant's said new building, and did cut holes in the chimney of said Victoria block for the stove pipes of and from said building of defendant, and did insert defendant's stove pipes therein, and has ever since used and enjoyed said south wall of said Victoria block, and said chimney and said cornice, for the purpose and in the manner aforesaid, and his enjoyment and use thereof has been visible, public and notorious, and he was in the enjoyment thereof when the plaintiff became the owner of, or entitled to, the reversion in said land and premises and said Victoria block, and the same was known to the plaintiff, and he had notice of the foregoing facts and circumstances when he became the owner thereof, or entitled to said reversion, and he took the same subject to said easements, and said right enjoyed by defendant as aforesaid, and said alleged trespasses were the said use and enjoyment thereof by defendant.\"\nAs to the 7th plea, plaintiff replied, no such deed or grant; and that \"when he became owner of said building, close and messuage, he had no notice of such rights, easements and privileges, and did not become such owner subject thereto as alleged; as to the 8th plea, plaintiff, by his 9th replication, denies each and every allegation and statement contained in said plea.\n\"And for an eleventh replication the plaintiff, as to said eighth plea, and for a defence upon equitable grounds, says that the plaintiff, when he became the owner of said land and premises, and said Victoria block, or entitled to said reversion as set out in the declaration, had no notice or knowledge of the alleged agreement or the said alleged facts and circumstances set out in said plea, and did not take the said land and premises and said Victoria block, or said reversion, or any of them, subject to said alleged easements and rights as alleged in said plea, and purchased and acquired and became owner of the said land free from any of the alleged easements and rights.\"\nIt may be as well to mention here, that on the argument before this court, a question was raised by defendant's counsel as to plaintiff's right to refer to or rely on the registry acts of Nova Scotia; when both parties desiring to get an adjudication on the respective rights of the parties apart from technical objections, the objection, that the registry acts had not been pleaded, was withdrawn by Mr. Rigby, and it was mutually agreed between the counsel that it if was necessary that plaintiff should have by his pleading relied on the registry acts, they were to be considered as having been duly pleaded, and on this understanding and agreement the argument proceeded. In this connection it may be well to notice the statutory enactments in Nova Scotia, which provide by R. S. N. S., cap. 94, sec. 26:\u2014\"That the form of the action need not be mentioned in the writ or other proceedings.\"\n\"By sec. 112\u2014That after writ issued, the parties may, by leave of the Court or a judge, state any question for trial, which they may think fit, without any pleadings, &c.\"\n\"Sec. 114\u2014Questions of law, after writ issued, may be stated for the opinion of the court without pleading.\"\n\"Sec. 116\u2014Every declaration, whether in the body of the writ or annexed, and subsequent pleadings which shall clearly and distinctly state all such matters of fact as are necessary to sustain the action, defence, or reply, as the case may be, shall be sufficient; and it shall not be necessary that such matters should be stated in any technical or formal language or manner, or that any technical or formal statements should be used.\"\n\"Sec. 121, on demurrer\u2014The court shall proceed and give judgment according as the very right of the cause and matter in law shall appear unto them, without regarding any imperfection, omission, defect in, or lack of form; and no judgment shall be arrested, stayed, or reversed for any such imperfection, omission, defect in or lack of form.\"\nSecs. 162 and 163\u2014Equitable pleas and replication to plea on equitable grounds allowed.\nSec. 182\u2014Different causes of action of whatever kind, except local causes arising in different counties, may be joined in the same suit. Sec. 191\u2014All defects and errors may be amended and all such amendments may be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining in the existing suit the real question in controversy between the parties.\nSec. 53\u2014In all cases of breach of contract or other injury where the party injured is entitled to maintain, and has brought an action, he may claim a writ of injunction, and may also in the same action include a claim for damages with redress.\nNo question arises as to the title of either plaintiff or defendant in their respective lots. The deed from Caldwell to Hunter, conveying right to use wall, is dated 22nd August, 1859; that by which Caldwell conveyed property to Nash, 15th July, 1862, registered 17th July, 1862. Nash to Forman, 15th July, 1863, registered 1st August, 1863. Forman to Bank, 26th July, 1870, registered 27th July, 1870. Caldwell to Hunter, registered 20th May, 1871. Bank to plaintiff 1st November, 1872.\nThe leading facts are as follows:\u2014The plaintiff owns the store to the north, measuring 16 feet ten inches on the street under a deed of 1st of November, 1872, from the Bank of Nova Scotia, who derived title through intermediate conveyances from Samuel Caldwell, whose deed to John D. Nash bears date 15th July, 1862, and makes no mention of any incumbrance on the property, nor was such incumbrance known to the Bank nor, as far as appears, to Forman, who conveyed to them. Hunter became the owner of the site on which his store is erected, measuring 24 feet 4 inches, by deed from Merkel, dated 22nd June, 1859, when Caldwell was the registered owner of the northern store, and on the 22nd of August, 1859, an agreement under seal was made between the two, whereby Caldwell, for the consideration of the sum of \u00a375, granted to Hunter, in order to save him the expense of a new north wall to his own building, the privilege of piercing the end of his, that is, Caldwell's wall, allowing the ends of the timbers and joists of the new building to be inserted therein, and using the south wall or end of Caldwell's lot in all respects to the depth or height of the new building, as if Hunter had built a new north wall to his own building; and Caldwell further agreed that Hunter might raise a new wall on the top of Caldwell's south wall, and might cut holes in the chimney then erected for stovepipes, and use the same at all times thereafter, This agreement, under which the encroachments now complained of were made, was not recorded, either from neglect, or from a notion that it did not come within the Registry Acts, until the 30th May, 1871, which was before the conveyance to the plaintiff; and two questions under these acts have arisen. The plaintiff, before completing his purchase, had the title searched by a solicitor of great experience, who traced it back to the year 1797, and in so tracing it looked for no conveyance or incumbrance from Caldwell after the title passed out of him, which was on the 15th July, 1862, by deed recorded two days after, in Book 137, the agreement being entered in Book 171.\nAs to this Registry the Chief Justice says:\u2014\"It was unknown to the plaintiff or to the solicitor he employed.\"\nIn the court below the case was decided solely on the ground that there was, when plaintiff purchased, a visible state of things existing \"which could not legally exist without being subject to a burthen of the extent and nature of which the law implies plaintiff to have had notice,\"; and therefore plaintiff could not disturb defendant in his enjoyment of the easements he had acquired\u2014in other words, that the plaintiff had constructive notice of the defendant's incumbrances or charges, and therefore bought the property subject to them. If the case turned on this question, I think the judgment should have been for the plaintiff. The erection or incumbrance was not such an one as could be seen by all passers-by. It could be seen but from one side of the street, and whether readily seen from that would depend much on the relative height of the building and the width of the street, of which no evidence is given; and not one person was called to prove that in passing the street he had noticed the incumbrance. Mr. Thompson, plaintiff's solicitor, though a Q.C. practising law in Halifax, and who constantly, if not daily, passed through Hollis street, one of the leading streets of Halifax, clearly had never observed it, nor had the plaintiff, though he bought the property in November, 1872, until he had a conversation with defendant in 1876, when he asked for an extension of a privilege he said he already enjoyed by a paper he had from Caldwell. He speaks thus:\u2014\"I said this is quite new to me. It was the first time I had heard of the privilege he claimed\u2014of the privilege to insert his joists in my wall. I had never heard of the paper before nor of the privilege;\" and plaintiff swears he never knew it was there.\nAustin, the surveyor, who prepared a plan of the building, says, on cross-examination: \"Looking from the west side of Hollis street I saw the projection marked on this plan (N). Any one could see it;\" but he does not say he saw it till he was called on to make the plan, and his attention called to it. And I think the fair inference from his evidence is, that he saw it after his attention was then called to it for the first time, and when he necessarily critically examined the building. McKenzie the builder, who worked at the erection of defendant's building in 1860, on examination, says: \"Any one could see the projection from the street.\" No doubt any one could see it from the west side of the street, and as the witness assisted in the erection of the encumbrance, he of course well knew it was there. But Hendry the surveyor, called by the defendant, and who prepared plan (N), says: \"A wall 1 1\/2 brick wide projects over plaintiff's. It is plainly visible to any person looking at it, so also the fact of defendant's having no north wall by examining the windows.\" But this witness shews the force of the observation I have made in respect to the evidence of Austin and McKenzie. Cross-examined, he says: \"I did not notice this until Mr. Lynch (defendant's attorney) spoke to me. Any person would observe all this if his attention were called to it.\" And on this evidence, and this only, defendant rests his case as establishing constructive notice against the plaintiff. Of the innumerable number of persons in Halifax who must have daily passed this building from the 22nd August, 1859, the date of the license, until the 1st November, 1872, when plaintiff bought from bank, not one individual was called who had noticed the incumbrance by defendant's erection on plaintiff's property. Was it then a structure so visible\u2014so apparent to the eyes that it could not have escaped the notice of any reasonable man.\nUnder the evidence it appears to me the erection was such that might most easily and innocently have escaped the observations of an intending purchaser, who would, most naturally, finding the property clear on the records, and not having his attention called to to it, assume it to be unencumbered. I cannot think that a purchaser was bound to go to the opposite side of the street and look up to see if he could discover any encroachments, or that it would enter the mind of any ordinary purchaser to do so. Of the case of Hervey V. Smith[27], referred to and relied on by the learned Chief Justice in the Court below, a much stronger case than this, Mr. Sugden, in his work on Vendors and Purchasers, thus speaks:\u2014\"This seems to carry constructive \"notice beyond its proper limits, and this \"rule requires a purchaser of a house to look upwards \"as well as 'about him\" before he completes his pur \"chase,\" and it may be added that Mr. Dart in his work in a note puts \"sed q.\" to this case. Had plaintiff's attention been called to it, or had the obstruction been of that character or in that position that it was necessarily visible and could not reasonably have escaped observation, then a visible state of things would exist apart from registry acts which, as Lord Justice Brett[28] says, could not legally exist without the property being subject to some burthen, and plaintiff would be taken to have notice of the extent and nature of that burthen. But, as the same learned judge says:\u2014\"The 'doctrine of constructive notice ought to be narrowly \"watched and not enlarged. Indeed, anything 'constructive' \"ought to be narrowly watched, because it \"depends on a fiction.\" I think in this case the incumbrance was not so prominent and conspicuous and necessarily visible, as to make the purchaser guilty of negligent ignorance, and as it is clear the plaintiff had no actual notice, and that his attention never was called to this incumbrance, and the evidence, to my mind, shows it was not an obstruction which would be noticed unless attention was called to it, therefore to detect it extraordinary circumspection would be required[29]. To extend the law of constructive notice to a case such as this would, I think, be dangerous and unwarranted. And Mr. Sugden on Vendors and purchasers goes even further than this, and says: \"The question upon constructive notice, is, not whether the purchaser had the means of obtaining, and might by prudent caution have obtained, the knowledge in question, but whether the not obtaining it was an act of gross or culpable negligence.\"\nBut if there had been constructive notice\u2014notice of that character would not be sufficient as against a registered deed. By the Nova Seotia Revised Statutes, Pt. II., Title XVIII., cap. 79, sec. 9:\u2014\"All deeds, judgments and attachments affecting lands shall be registered in the office of the county or district in which the lands lie.\"\nSec. 19.\u2014\"Deeds or mortgages of lands duly executed but not registered, shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration, who shall first register his deed or mortgage of such lands.\"\nNow, as to the deed from Caldwell to Hunter, under which he claims, I quite agree with the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia that it was a deed such as the statute contemplated should be registered. He says:\nNow, first of all, was it necessary to record this agreement? It is a deed by which Caldwell for a consideration in money imposed a serious burden upon his title, and to that extent unquestionably it affected his estate in the lot he owned and comes within the 9th section of our Registry Act, Rev. Stat. Chap. 79, directing that all deeds, judgments and attachments affecting lands shall be registered in the office of the county or district in which the lands lie, and by the 19th section deeds of lands duly executed but not registered, shall be void against any subsequent purchaser for valuable considerations who shall first register his deed of such lands.\nThe cases clearly establish that to defeat a registered deed there must be actual notice or fraud.\nThe policy of the Registration Acts is to free a purchaser from the imputation of constructive notice. In the absence of actual notice therefore to the principal or his agent, and of fraud, it has been held that a later registered deed will have priority over a prior unregistered charge notwithstanding that the purchaser knew that the title deeds were not in the possession of the vendors, but were in the hands of certain other persons, but abstained from inquiry.\nIn Wyatt v. Barwell[30] the Master of the Rolls (Sir Wm. Grant) says:\u2014\nA registered deed stands upon a different footing from an ordinary conveyance. It has been much doubted whether courts ought ever to have suffered the question of notice to be agitated as against a party who has duly registered his conveyance; but they have said, \"We cannot permit fraud to prevail;\" and it shall only be in cases, where the notice is so clearly proved, as to make it fraudulent in the purchaser to take and register a conveyance in prejudice to the known title of another, that we will suffer the registered deed to be affected.\nand after stating that\u2014\nEven under this limitation, the security, derived from the register, is considerably lessened; * * * * *\nconcludes:\u2014\nHowever, it is sufficient for the present purpose to say that it is only by actual notice clearly proved that a registered conveyance can be postponed. Even a Lis pendens is not deemed notice for that purpose.\nUpon the head of notice Mr. Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers says:\nIt has been decided: That the registry is not notice, and therefore a purchaser without notice obtaining the legal estate will not be prejudiced by a prior equitable incumbrance registered previously to his purchase.\nThat a purchaser with notice of a prior unregistered instrument is bound by it. But of course notice of a prior unregistered instrument is unimportant at law.\nA purchaser, therefore, may in equity be bound by a judgment or a deed, although not registered; but it must be satisfactorily proved that the person who registers the subsequent deed must have known exactly the situation of the person having the prior deed; and, knowing that, registered, in order to defraud them of that title he knew at the time was in them[31]. Apparent fraud, or clear and undoubted notice, would be a proper ground of relief; but suspicion of notice, though a strong suspicion, is not sufficient to justify the court in breaking in upon an Act of Parliament.\nAnd again, Sugden[32],\nNor is registration of deeds of itself notice to a purchaser who was seized of a legal estate at the time of the purchase. If a man search the register he will be deemed to have notice; but if a search is made for a particular period the purchaser will not by the search be deemed to have notice of any instrument not registered within that period.\nIn Chadwick v. Turner[33] it was held under the East Riding Registration Act, 6 Anne, c. 35, that a title which has been registered can only be affected by a clear and distinct notice amounting to fraud.\nSir J. J. Turner says:\nThat the facts which are proved on the part of the defendants raise a strong suspicion of notice cannot be denied, but I think that they fall short of what is required to affect a registered title, for which purpose the notice must be clear and distinct, amounting, in fact, to fraud.\nand cites Wyatt v. Barwell[34]. So in Rice v. O'Connor[35].\nIn this case, where a purchaser under a registered deed had not express notice of an alleged parol contract under which the tenant was in possession, the Master of the Rolls treated it as clear that the purchaser was not liable to it, unless his conveyance bound him, for there was not that \"clear and undoubted notice which is necessary to affect a party claiming under a registered deed.\"\nIn the Agra Bank v. Barry[36] Lord Selborne held it was inconsistent with the policy of the Irish registration law to impose on a mortgagee or purchaser the duty of inquiring with a view to the discovery of previous unregistered interests; but quite consistent with it, if he knows of the existence of those instruments, to estop him from contending that as to him they are void merely because they are unregistered.\nIn Lee v. Clutton, Jessel, M. R.[37]:\nI am clearly of opinion that in this suit, as it is framed, I cannot treat the defendant Clutton as having had actual notice of the plaintiff's security. But, then, as I understand the law on the subject of postponing a person who has registered under the Registry Acts with notice of a prior unregistered incumbrance, the notice which is to postpone him must be actual notice, in the sense of positive notice given to the person or his agent; or it may possibly be sufficient, instead of alleging actual notice, to charge the person whom you seek to postpone with something actually amounting to fraud. I say that it may possibly be sufficient, because, although the earlier cases apparently indicate that actual notice must be proved, I am aware that there are some observations in the judgment of Lord Cairns, in the recent case of the Agra Bank (limited) v. Barry[38] to which I shall presently allude, which point to something else as being sufficient.\nIn regard to the earlier cases, in Hine v. Dodd[39], Lord Hardwicke, speaking of the object of the Registration Act (7 Anne, c. 20) as being to prevent parol proof of notice, goes on:\u2014\"But notwithstanding, \"there are cases where this court has broken in upon \"this, though one incumbrance was registered before another, but \"it was in cases of fraud. There may possibly heve been cases \"upon notice divested of fraud, but there the proof must be extremely \"clear. But though, in the present case, there are strong \"circumstances of notice before the execution of the mortgage, yet \"upon mere suspicion only, I will not overturn a positive law.\" That is to say, he considered it necessary to prove either fraud or clear positive notice, Then Sir William Grant in Wyatt v. Barwell[40] says:\u2014\"It has been much doubted whether courts ought ever to have suffered the question of notice to be agitated as against a party who has duly registered his conveyance, but they have said, 'We cannot permit fraud to prevail, and it shall only be in cases where the notice is so clearly proved as to make it fraudulent in the purchaser to take and register a conveyance in prejudice to the known title of another, that we will suffer the registered deed to be affected.'\" It is hardly necessary to go through all the cases, but I must refer to Chadwick v. Turner[41], where Lord Justice Turner says:\u2014\"That the facts which are proved raise a strong suspicion of \"notice cannot be denied, but I think they fall short of what is required \"to affect a registered title, for which purpose the notice \"must be clear and distinct, and amounting in fact to fraud.\" Lord Hatherley's view in Rolland v. Hart [42] is the same:\u2014\"It is not perhaps very easy to see the exact shades of distinction between the cases, but this appears to be decided from the time of Hine v. Dodd downwards, that a mere suspicion of fraud is not enough, and there must be actual notice implying fraud in the person registering the second incumbrance to deprive him of priority thereby gained over the first incumbrance.\"\nIn all these oases down to Wyatt v. Barwell, the expression is, that there must be actual notice amounting to fraud. It is very well put in Mr. Dart's book[43], that it must be actual notice, which renders it fraudulent to attempt to obtain priority, or to advance money when knowing that another person has already advanced money upon the same security, and afterwards unrighteously to attempt to deprive him of the benefit of that security by taking advantage of the Registration Act.\nThe only notice charged by this bill is, that the defendant Clutton, when he took his conveyance, knew that the deeds were in the hands of the plaintiff, and made no enquiry; the whole of the case attempted to be made is a neglect or omission to enquire, and it is now admitted at the bar that that cannot be put higher than being constructive notice of the plaintiff's charge. That being so, and constructive notice being insufficient according to the authorities I have referred to, I find further, that no case of fraud is made by the bill, as that Clutton actually knew at the time of his purchase of facts which would affect his title, and that he purposely and fraudulently abstained from inquiring into them. Whether or not an allegation of that kind would be sufficient I am not called upon to decide. On the authorities I am inclined to think that actual notice is necessary. The very object of the Registration Acts is to exclude prior charges of which you have no actual notice, and to absolve you from the necessity of inquiring. So far is the register relied upon in practice as entitling the person registering to priority that I have known solicitors in Yorkshire actually complete purchases in the registry office to prevent any questions from arising. The judgment of the House of Lords in the case of The Agra Bank v. Barry, to which I have referred, entirely sup ports the view which I have expressed as to the necessity for actual notice. (His lordship read passages on the subject from the speeches of Lords Cairns, Hatherley and Selborne in that case), There are, however, these words used by Lord Cairns[44], which give me difficulty:\n\"Of course you may have cases in which there may be such a course of conduct as was indicated in Kennedy v. Green[45] commented on in the case of Jones v. Smith[46] by Vice-Chancellor Wigram, conduct so reckless, so intensely negligent, that you are absolutely unable to account for it in any other way than this, that, by reason of a suspicion entertained by the person whose conduct you are examining that there was an unregistered deed before his, he will abstain from enquiring into the fact, because he is so satisfied that the fact exists that he feels persuaded that if he did inquire he must find it out. I do not wish to express any decided opinion at this moment upon a case of that kind. If such a case should arise, I do not desire to say whether, in my opinion, such a case could or could not be deemed sufficient to get rid of the provisions of the Irish Registry Act.\"\nIn the same case on appeal,[47]\nJAMES, L.J., says:\u2014\nIt appears to me that the law applicable to this case is very clearly summed up by Lord Selborne in the Agra Bank v. Barry, and that having regard to the law as there laid down, it is impossible for us to come to any other decision than that arrived at by the Master of the Bolls. Lord Selborne there says:\u2014\"I entirely agree with the opinion which your lordships have expressed. It has been said in argument that investigation of title and inquiry after deeds is 'the duty' of a purchaser or a mortgagee, and, no doubt, there are authorities (not involving any question of registry) which do use that language. But this, if it can properly be called a duty, is not a duty owing to the possible holder of a latent title or security. It is merely the course which a man, dealing bon\u00e2 fide in the proper and usual manner, for his own interest, ought, by himself or his solicitor, to follow, with a view to his own title and his own security. If he does not follow that course, the omission of it may be a thing requiring to be accounted for or explained. It may be evidence, if it is not explained, of a design inconsistent with bon\u00e2 fide dealing, to avoid knowledge of the true state of the title. What is a sufficient explanation must always be a question to be decided with reference to the nature and circumstances of each particular case, and among these the existence of a public registry, in a county in which a registry is established by statute, must necessarily be very material. It would, I think, be quite inconsistent with the policy of the Register Act, which tells a purchaser or mortgagee that a prior unregistered deed is fraudulent and void as against a later registered deed, I say it would be altogether inconsistent with that policy to hold that a purchaser or mortgagee is under an obligation to make any inquiries with a view to the discovery of unregistered interests. But it is quite consistent with that, that if he or his agent actually knows of the existence of such unregistered instruments when he takes his own deed, he may be estopped in equity from saying that, as to him, they are fraudulent.\" The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMellish, L.J., and Baggallay, J.A., concurred.\nIt has been suggested, that supposing the deed did not give defendant a right to this incumbrance as against plaintiff, still plaintiff could not recover in this action. I cannot appreciate this objection. It does not appear to have been taken on the trial, or suggested by counsel, or noticed by the bench in the court below, nor is to be found in the factum of the defendant; nor, according to my notes, was it urged by defendant's counsel on the argument, nor, had it been presented, do I think it could have been of any avail. If this incumbrance had been legally erected as against Caldwell, when Caldwell ceased to own, and the title and possession of the property became absolutely vested in the bank without notice, defendant ceased to have the right to continue the incumbrance, and when the title and possession of the property passed to the plaintiff, plaintiff had a right to require its removal, and when he did so, on the 1st September, 1876, the continuance by defendant of the incumbrance or nuisance became a legal wrong for which plaintiff was entitled to seek redress, and the declaration and pleadings in this case, in my opinion, in the words of the statute of Nova Scotia \"clearly and distinctly state all such matters of fact as are necessary to sustain the action,\" and as are necessary for the purpose of determining in this suit the real question in controversy between the parties.\nIt may be very hard on the defendant, who possibly may have acted, and most probably did act, on the supposition that he had the right to erect and continue for all time the incumbrances, but it would be equally hard on the plaintiff, who bon\u00e2 fide purchased his property free of all incumbrances, to have it burthened with incumbrances such as this. But of the two, on whom should the hardship rest? Certainly not on the plaintiff, who bought and paid for his property without any knowledge that anything had been done to encumber it; and equally certainly on the defendant who has brought this difficulty on himself by neglecting to register his deed. The conduct of the plaintiff in this matter is, in my opinion, without reproach; he is only seeking to obtain what he bought and paid for, and which the law gives him, and in reference to which his conduct has been most considerate and perfectly upright, and so far from desiring to use his rights against defendant harshly, he seems to me to have been disposed to act in the most considerate and liberal manner towards defendant when he \"offered to allow the encroachments to remain if defendant admitted his right.\"\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the evidence supports the second, fourth and fifth counts of the plaintiff's declaration which are in trespass. It makes little difference, since the abolition of forms of action, whether the injuries complained of are to be classified as wrongs which were formerly remediable in actions of trespass, or in some other form of action; so long as the declaration shows a legal injury that is sufficient. The wrongs complained of in the counts I have mentioned would, however, under the old system of actions, have been the subjects of an action of trespass inasmuch as they amounted to direct injuries to the plaintiff's land. Thus driving nails into another's wall, or even placing objects against it, have been held to be trespasses[48].\nThe acts of the defendant in inserting his beams in the wall of the house then belonging to Caldwell, and now the property of the plaintiff, and in cutting holes in the wall and chimney were therefore illegal acts, that is trespasses, except in so far as they were justified by the grant or license of Caldwell. Then the continuance of these illegal burdens on the plaintiff's property since the fee has been acquired by him are also in law fresh and distinct trespasses against the plaintiff, for which he is entitled to recover damages unless he is bound by the license or grant of Caldwell. This is shewn very clearly by the case of Holmes v. Wilson[49], where the trustees of a turnpike road having built buttresses to support it on the land of A, and A thereupon having sued them and their workmen in trespass for such erection, and having accepted money paid into court in full satisfaction of the trespass, it was held that after notice to the defendant to remove the buttresses and a refusal to do so, A might bring another action of trespass against them for keeping and continuing the buttresses on the land to which the former recovery was no bar. In this case the court considered that the continued use of the buttresses for the support of the road under the circumstances was a fresh trespass. And in Hudson v. Nicholson[50], there was a decison to the same effect, and the court likened the case to that of a defendant who persists in holding out a pole over his neighbor's land and who they say would be liable in trespass as long as he continued to do so. In Russell v. Brown[51] it was held that a mere continuance of a building wrongfully erected on the land of another is a continuing trespass, for which the owner of the land may bring new actions after recovery and satisfaction for the original erection. And it is well settled that where an injury to property is actionable without proof of actual damage, new suits for the damage caused by its continuance may be brought from day to day[52]. Therefore as the injuries complained of were not and could not be denied in point of fact, the plaintiff made out a sufficient prim\u00e2 facie case so soon as he had proved his title, which he did by putting in and proving the title deeds shewing a clear chain of title from Caldwell to himself, through Nash, Forman and the Bank of Nova Scotia; the three latter deeds in this chain of title being conveyances for valuable consideration.\nThe defendant is consequently compelled to resort to his defence under the pleas of justification. These are two, first, that of leave and license by the plaintiff, and secondly, the grant by deed of an easement by Caldwell authorizing the commission of the acts complained of as trespasses. There is no pretence for saying that there was any license by the plaintiff, and even if an irrevocable license given by Caldwell or Nash, to do the acts complained of, were admissible under the plea of leave and license, it is clear that there was no such license apart from the deed of grant which is the subject of the other pleas of justification. The defence must therefore depend altogether on this deed of grant. The operative part of this deed, which is dated the 22nd day August, 1859, and purports to have been made between Samuel Caldwell (who was then seized of the fee simple in the plaintiff's land) of the first part, and the defendant of the second part, is in form a covenant in the words following:\nNow, this agreement witnesseth that the said Samuel Caldwell for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said James Hunter, his executors, administrators and assigns in manner following, that is to say: That he, the said Samuel Caldwell, for and in consideration of the sum of seventy-five pounds currency, to him in hand paid by the said James Hunter, hereby agrees to permit and allow the said James Hunter, his contractors, builders and workmen to make use of the south end or wall of the brick building or Victoria block, in every way that may be requisite and necessary, so as to save the said James Hunter the expense of a new north wall to his own building, and to pierce the end of the said wall to allow the ends of the timbers and joists of the new building to be inserted therein, and to use the said south end or wall of the Victoria block in all respects to the depth and height of the new building as if the said James Hunter had built a new north wall for his own building; and as it is intended that the new building shall be higher than the Victoria block, it is further agreed by and between the said parties that the said James Hunter and his contractors and workmen may raise a new wall on the top of the south end or cornice of the said Victoria block, and continue the same upwards to the full height and depth of the said new building, and also to cut a hole or holes in the chimney now erected for stove-pipes, and to have the right and privilege of using the same at all times hereafter for that purpose. The said James Hunter hereby agrees to raise the said chimney as high as may be necessary, and to make good the new wall on the top of the present finish or cornice of the Victoria block and round the chimney to prevent leakage; and, further, that in the erection of the said new building as little damage as possible shall be done to the south wall of the Victoria building, and that all holes or any other damage shall be filled up and made good by the said James Hunter.\nIt is apparent from the mere perusal of this instrument that all the rights conceded by it were properly the subject of easements in the strict definition of the word, being the privilege of imposing certain burdens on the land of the grantor for the benefit of the adjoining land of the grantee. That a mere covenant under seal will enure as a grant for the purpose of creating an easement, even though the technical word \"grant\" is not used as a word of conveyance is well established by authority[53]. This covenant or agreement is therefore prim\u00e2 facie a complete defence to the action, and in the record as originally framed it was not in any way impeached.\nIt appears, however, from the note of the learned Chief Justice who tried the case, that at the trial the objection was made that the grant of an easement effected by this instrument was avoided under the Registry Act of Nova Scotia, by reason of its non-registration until after the conveyance from Nash to Forman, which was the first conveyance for valuable consideration of the plaintiff's property subsequent in date to the agreement set up by the defendant, and afterwards in the argument in banc the same question of the Registry Act, and the sufficiency of the evidence as shewing that its operation was obviated by notice was the only point argued, and that on which the court below proceeded, it being there held that the Registry Act applied, but that there was such notice of the defendants rights as in equity to disentitle the plaintiff to insist upon it.\nUpon the argument of this appeal, attention having been called by the court to the state of the record, as not containing any replication setting up the registry laws as an answer to the defendant's plea of justification under the agreement, it was agreed by counsel on both sides that the record should be considered as amended in that respect, and the case was argued as though such amendment had been made, and subsequently, at the suggestion of the court, the coun- sel drew and filed with the Registrar two replications and three rejoinders, which it was agreed by them should be considered as being added to the record. The replications which are replied to the 7th and 8th pleas, being those by which the deed of the 22nd August, 1859, is pleaded, are as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff says that the alleged deed or grant from said Caldwell to the defendant was not recorded in the registry of deeds until the year 1871, and that said Caldwell had long previously to said recording, to wit, in the year 1862, conveyed the lands and buildings now of the plaintiff, and referred to in the plaintiff's declaration to one Nash, who had recorded his deed thereof, and the said Nash had sold and conveyed the said lands and buildings to one Forman, who was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser thereof for value, without notice of said deed or grant, and who also had recorded his deed thereof; and the said Forman had sold and conveyed the said lands and buildings to the Bank of Nova Scotia, who was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser thereof for value, without notice of said deed or grant, and who also had recorded the deed thereof to the said bank, and all the said conveyances and sales mentioned herein had been made, and all the deeds mentioned herein were recorded in the registry of deeds for the county of Halifax (in which county the said lands and buildings are situate), prior to the recording of the deed or grant set up in said seventh plea.\nBy the first of his added rejoinders the defendant takes issues upon the replications. By the second, he alleges, by way of a legal answer, that\nSaid grantees, before and at the time when they became entitled to said property, were put upon enquiry and had notice of said privileges, easements, and rights acquired by defendant in and under said agreement, deed or grant of said Caldwell, in and over and upon said land and property of the plaintiff.\nAnd the third rejoinder is in the same words, but pleaded on equitable grounds.\nThe question of priority under the registry laws is therefore now formally presented in the record.\nThe dates of the execution and registration of the several deeds are as follows: The deed granting the easement by Caldwell to the defendant was executed on the 22nd August, 1859, and not registered until the 20th May, 1871. The deed from Caldwell to Nash was executed 15th July, 1862, and registered 17th July, 18.62. The deed from Nash to Forman dated 15th July, 1863, and registered 1st August, 1863. The deed Forman to the Bank of Nova Scotia was dated 26th July, 1870, and registered 27th July, 1870, and the deed Bank of Nova Scotia to the plaintiff was dated 1st November, 1872, and registered on the 20th January, 1873.\nThe first point raised against the application of the Registry Act in the plaintiff's favour is that the deed of 22nd August, 1859, by which the easement in question was orignally granted, was not an instrument requiring registration under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Registry Act. This question appears to have been raised in the court below, and though no explicit decision is pronounced upon it, it is to be inferred from the judgment that the court considered it an instrument requiring registration. The material clauses of the registry act, Rev. Stats., N. S., 4th series, ch. 79, are the 9th and 19th. By the 9th sec. it is enacted that\nAll deeds judgments and attachments affecting lands shall be registered in the office of the county or district in which the lands lie.\nThe 19th sec. is as follows:\nDeeds or mortgages of lands duly executed but not registered, shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration who shall first register his deed or mortgage of such land.\nIt is contended, as I understand the argument, that the deed of 22nd August, 1859, is not a \"deed of lands\" within this 19th sec., and is consequently not avoided by the prior registration of a subsequent conveyance for valuable consideration, I have no difficulty in deciding against this contention. In the first place, I am of opinion that the two sections\u2014the 9th and 19th\u2014are to be read and construed together, and that sec. 19 is to be taken as attaching the consequences of nonregistration to all deeds which the 9th sec. says \"shall be registered,\" the consequence of which construction must be that the words \"deeds of lands\" in sec. 19 must be read as convertible with the terms \"deeds affecting lands\" in sec. 9; and if this is so there can be little doubt that a grant of an easement or servitude is a deed \"affecting\" the land to be burdened by it. Without the help of the context afforded by the 9th sec., I should, however, have held the words \"deeds of lands\" in the 19th sec. standing alone sufficient to include an instrument of this kind. The general policy of the registry laws, which has for its object the protection of purchasers against surprise from secret conveyances, and the interpretation placed upon the Middlesex and Yorkshire Acts in England, alike authorize such a construction.\nIn applying the provisions of both the English and Irish Acts it has been held that any writing, however informal, affecting lands is to be deemed a \"conveyance\" within the meaning of that expression as used in those acts. And a mere memorandum constituting an equitable charge on lands is held to be subject to avoidance for non registration upon the subsequent registry of another instrument[54]. A late writer of high authority[55] thus states the law:\nIt seems to be now well settled that every instrument which transfers an interest in or creates a charge on lands is a conveyance within the meaning of the Registry Acts.\nThe whole scheme and policy of the law in requiring the registration of titles would be frustrated if such were not the law. Therefore I am of opinion that the deed of 22nd August, 1859, was liable to be defeated in favour of a subsequent purchaser for value, holding under a registered chain of title from the same grantee, who first registered his conveyance. Nash seems not to have been a grantee for valuable consideration, in fact it appears that he was in truth the vendor of the easement to the defendant, for the deed was made at his request, and the consideration money was paid to him, as is stated by Caldwell in his evidence. Forman was however a purchaser for value, and as such entitled, upon registering his conveyance, to the protection of the Registry Act. The consequence is that from the date of the registration of the conveyance from Nash to Forman the deed of grant became, at least at law, void against Forman and all those claiming title through him as the plaintiff does.\nIt is however alleged in the equitable rejoinder which the defendant has filed that the plaintiff and those through whom he claims had notice of the defendant's title to this easement at the time they obtained their conveyances. This is only material as regards Forman, the first purchaser for value, for if the deed of 22nd August, 1859, became void as against Forman upon the registration of his conveyance, as it did if he had no actual notice of that instrument, it is equally void against all subsequent purchasers claiming under him, even though they may have had notice. Notice to the plaintiff himself is therefore wholly immaterial if Forman had no notice.\nThe court below determined that the state of the premises was itself sufficient notice; and proceeding upon this ground, and upon the supposed authority of cases which seem to me totally inapplicable to the question presented for decision, they held the plaintiff disentitled to the benefit of the registry laws. It is well settled that nothing short of actual notice, such notice as makes it a fraud on the part of a purchaser to insist on the registry laws, is sufficient to disentitle a party to insist in equity on a legal priority acquired under the statute.\nIn Wyatt v. Barwell[56], Sir William Grant puts this proposition very clearly. He says:\nIt has been much doubted whether courts ought ever to have suffered the question of notice to be agitated as against a party who has duly registered his conveyance; but they have said: \"We cannot permit fraud to prevail, and it shall only be in cases where the notice is so clearly proved as to make it fraudulent in the purchaser to take and register a conveyance in prejudice to the known title of another that we will suffer the registered deed to be affected.\"\nAgain, in Agra Bank v. Barry[57], Lord Cairns states the principle and the reasons for it as follows:\nAny person reading over that Act of Parliament would, perhaps, in the first instance, conclude, as has often been said, that it was an act absolutely decisive of priority under all circumstances, and enacting that under every circumstance that could be supposed, the deed first registered was to take precedence of a deed which, although it might be executed before, was not registered till afterwards. But by decisions which have now, as it seems to me, well established the law, and which it would not be, I think, expedient in any way now to call in question, it has been settled that, notwithstanding the apparent stringency of the words contained in this Act of Parliament, still, if a person in Ireland registers a deed, and if at the time he registers the deed either he himself, or an agent, whose knowledge is the knowledge of his principal, has notice of an earlier deed, which, though executed, is not registered, the registration which he actually effects will not give him priority over that earlier deed; and I take the explanation of those decisions to be that which was given by Lord King in the case of Blades v. Blades[58], upwards of 150 years ago, the case which was mentioned just now at your lordship's bar. I take the explanation to be this: that inasmuch as the object of the statute is to take care that, by the fact of deeds being placed upon a register, those who come to register a subsequent deed shall be informed of the earlier title, the end and object of the statute is accomplished, if the person coming to register a deed has, aliunde, and not by means of the register, notice of a deed affecting the property executed before his own. In that case the notoriety which it was the object of the statute to secure, is effected, effected in a different way, but effected as absolutely in respect of the person who thus comes to register, as if he had found upon the register notice of the earlier deed. If that is so, your Lordships will observe that those cases depend and depend entirely upon the question of actual notice, either to the principal or to his agent, whose knowledge is the knowledge of the principal.\nLord Selborne in the same case also affirms the same doctrine. He says:\nIt would be quite inconsistent with the policy of the Registry Act, which tells a purchaser or mortgagee that a prior unregistered deed is fraudulent and void as against a later registered deed,- I say it would be altogether inconsistent with that policy to hold that a purchaser or mortgagee is under an obligation to make any enquiries with a view to the discovery of unregistered interests. But it is quite consistent with that, that if he or his agent actually knows of the existence of such unregistered instruments when he takes his own deed, he may be estopped in equity from saying that, as to him, they are fraudulent.\nIn Lee v. Clutton, the Court of Appeal decided the same point, following, of course, the previous decision of the House of Lords in the Agra Bank v. Barry, and affirming the judgment of Jessel, M. R.[59].\nI have dwelt more on this point than I otherwise should, for the reason that in the interval between the judgment of Sir William Grant in Wyatt v. Barwell, and the decision of the House of Lords in the Agra Bank v. Barry, the authority of the previous case had been disregarded by Vice Chancellor Stuart, who, in the case of Wormald v. Maitland[60], had held constructive notice to be sufficient to postpone a registered deed, and his decision had been followed by the Vice Chancellor of Ireland, in re Alien's Estates[61]. Both these cases were, however, overruled by the later cases in the House of Lords and Court of Appeal already referred to. So far indeed from the courts having evinced any inclination to carry the principle of notice of an unregistered deed any further, so as to make constructive notice sufficient to take away the priority given by the statute to the grantee in the registered deed, I find in a very late case before the Court of Appeal in England[62] the whole doctrine of Courts of Equity in this matter impugned and severely criticized by a judge of great experience, Lord Justice Bramwell, who, although he reluctantly yielded to the force of authority, thus concludes his judgment:\nI doubt very much whether the principle of Courts of Equity ought to be extended to cases where registration is provided for by statute. I do not know whether I have grasped the doctrines of equity correctly in this matter, but if I have they seem to me to be like a good many other doctrines of Courts of Equity, the result of a disregard of general principles and general rules in the endeavour to do justice more or less fanciful in certain particular cases.\nApplying the law of Courts of Equity thus settled to the facts of the present case, it is obvious that the defendant does not support his equitable rejoinder unless he proves actual notice of the deed of 22nd August, 1859, to the plaintiff, or to his properly authorized agent. Then, it is not sufficent, to enable us to answer this enquiry favourably to the defendant, to find that from the state of the property purchased by the plaintiff there was ocular proof that the wall of the house had been built upon for the purpose of the defendant's house, and was used by the defendant as a party wall, and that holes had been cut in the chimney; if, indeed, the evidence is sufficient to warrant any such inference, a question, which I do not stop to consider, as it seems to me to be entirely immaterial. What we must find, in order to hold that the defendant is entitled to a verdict, is that he had knowledge of the deed conferring the title to the easement, not merely that the defendant was in fact in the enjoyment of such an easement; and of this I need scarcely say there is not a particle of proof. There is consequently nothing to affect the priority gained by the plaintiff, claiming through a registered chain of title under Forman, by reason of the registration of the conveyance to the latter anterior to the registration of the deed of grant.\nThe equitable rejoinder admits the allegation in the replication that Forman was a purchaser for value. There is, however, a rejoinder added to the record, in which all the allegations of the replication are traversed, and amongst those so put in issue is the averment that Forman was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value. Strictly speaking, there ought to have been evidence of this fact aliunde the conveyance from Nash to Forman, which, though on its face it purports to be a conveyance for value, is, as regards the defendant, res inter alios; having regard, however, to the admissions made at the bar by which Forman was treated as a purchaser for value, and to the desire expressed by counsel for both parties, that the appeal should be decided on its merits, and particularly with reference to the question of registration and notice, I do not feel disposed to raise any difficulty upon the want of evidence in this respect, but, I think, an affidavit should be filed in the court below, showing Formant's purchase to have been for value.\nThe result is, therefore, that we must treat the deed of 22nd August, 1859, as wholly void as against the plaintiff. The defendant, therefore, although not liable to either Nash or Caldwell, so long as the title to the plaintiff's property remained in them, cannot justify his present continued acts of interference with it as against the plaintiff.\nThe cases referred to in the judgment of the court below have no application. They were not cases arising on the registry laws, but cases of what may be called equitable easements. It is well settled, that if on the sale of land the purchaser covenants not to use it in a specified manner, or the vendor covenants not to use adjoining land retained by him in a particular manner, this negative covenant, although amounting to a mere personal covenant at law, not in any way affecting the title, will in equity be held binding on all subsequent assigns of the covenantor, who may have notice of it. This, of course, does not apply in the case of a grant of an easement effectual at law, for in that case a purchaser takes the land subject to the burden, whether he has notice or not, just as he would be held to take it subject to a legal lien or mortgage, of which he had no notice. But as the covenants, in the class of cases I have mentioned, are binding, on the general principles of equity, only on subsequent purchasers from the covenantor with notice, courts of equity, when asked to enforce such covenants against assignees for valuable consideration, apply the ordinary equitable doctrine of constructive notice, which raises a very different question from that of actual notice, sufficient to save an unregistered deed from the operation of the statute; the enquiry, in these cases of covenants, being, not whether the purchaser had any actual knowledge of the deed, but whether he had notice of such facts as would, if he had pursued enquiries, which they ought to have induced him to make, have ultimately led him to the discovery of the deed. It is precisely notice of this kind\u2014constructive or imputed notice\u2014that the House of Lords have most emphatically said, in Barry v. Agra Bank, is not sufficient in cases under the registry laws.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that we ought to allow this appeal with costs, and that, upon the affidavit I have mentioned being filed in the court below, the rule nisi for a new trial should be discharged with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLa question en cette cause est de savoir si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme encore gr\u00e9v\u00e9e de la servitude impos\u00e9e en faveur de Hunter, l'intim\u00e9, par Caldwell, un des quatre propri\u00e9taires qui ont poss\u00e9d\u00e9 avant Ross l'immeuble dont il s'agit. Cette question me para\u00eet devoir \u00eatre uniquement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la loi d'enregistrement de la Nouvelle-Ecosse. D'apr\u00e8s la sec. 9 du ch. 79 statut refondu, \"All deeds, judgments \"and attachments affecting lands shall be registered \"in the office of the County or District in which \"the lands lie.\" L'acte du 22 ao\u00fbt 1859, intitul\u00e9 Memorandum of agreement, par lequel Caldwell a c\u00e9d\u00e9 pour \u00a375 \u00e0 Hunter les droits de se servir du mur sud-est de sa maison, avec facult\u00e9 de l'exhausser de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter \u00e0 ce dernier les frais de construction d'un nouveau mur, est rev\u00eatu de toutes les formalit\u00e9s pour en faire un acte (deed) suivant la loi anglaise. Il est sign\u00e9 par les parties, scell\u00e9 et d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence de t\u00e9moins. Il comporte \u00e0 sa face, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration. Il est \u00e9vident que la transaction dont il fait preuve \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 affecter l'immeuble de Caldwell. Cet acte renferme donc toutes les conditions des actes qui doivent \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de la sec. 9. La section 19 nous dit quelle sera la cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement d'un tel acte. \"Deeds \"or mortgages of lands duly executed but not registered, \"shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or \"mortgagee for valuable consideration, who shall first \"register his deed or mortgage of such lands.\" Les termes de cette section sont clairs et prononcent en faveur d'un acqu\u00e9reur, pour valable consid\u00e9ration, la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance absolue de tous les droits ant\u00e9rieurs, que pouvait avoir sur un immeuble ainsi acquis, celui qui n'avait pas fait enregistrer son titre lorsque l'immeuble a chang\u00e9 de mains. L'acte de Caldwell \u00e0 Hunter n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 que le 20 mai 1871. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 des mains de Caldwell \u00e0 Nash, et de Nash \u00e0 Forman, et de ce dernier \u00e0 la banque de la Nouvelle-Ecosse par acte du 26 juillet 1870, et enregistr\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 Halifax, dans le livre B, 167, p. 598. Par cet acte la banque \u00e9tait devenue l'acqu\u00e9reur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question pour la somme de $27,000. Il n'y avait pas alors d'enregistrement de l'acte de Caldwell \u00e0 Hunter; et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 se trouvait par cons\u00e9quent exempte des servitudes impos\u00e9es par Caldwell en faveur d'Hunter. L'enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le 20 mai 1871, lorsque Caldwell avait depuis longtemps cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire, et lorsque la banque \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire et en possession pour valable consid\u00e9ration. Cet enregistrement ne pouvait, d'apr\u00e8s la sec. 19 de l'acte d'enregistrement, conf\u00e9rer aucun droit \u00e0 Hunter qui, faute d'enregistrement dans le temps voulu, avait perdu tous ses droits. L'enregistrement qu'il a fait alors n'a pu les faire revivre \u00e0 l'encontre de l'Appelant. Mais on objecte encore \u00e0 ce dernier que les marques de cette servitude \u00e9tant visibles, il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme en ayant eu avis. D'abord ce fait est loin d'\u00eatre clairement prouv\u00e9. Il faut faire une attention toute particuli\u00e8re et regarder bien haut, dans une rue tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite, pour s'apercevoir qu'Hunter a construit sur le mur de la maison de Ross. Les autres usages qu'Hunter a fait du mur ne paraissent pas \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. Je ne consid\u00e8re donc pas ces indices comme suffisants pour faire preuve que Ross doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme acqu\u00e9reur avec avis de l'existence des servitudes en question.\nPour emp\u00eacher l'effet de la loi d'enregistrement, il ne fallait pas moins qu'un avis sp\u00e9cial (actual notice) de l'existence des droits en question. C'est la doctrine d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans la cause de Lee vs. Clutton,[63] soutenu par les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s qui y sont cit\u00e9es. Ce jugement consacre la v\u00e9ritable doctrine applicable \u00e0 cette cause en exigeant en pareil cas avis sp\u00e9cial (actual notice).\nThe very object of the Registration Act is to exclude prior charges of which you have no actual notice, and to absolve you from the necessity of inquiry............The judgment of the House of Lords in the case of the Agra Bank vs. Barry, to which I have referred, entirely supports the view I have expressed as to the necessity for actual notice.\nPour ces motifs je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\nI have arrived at the same conclusion. Registry acts, such as have been passed in Nova Scotia, are supposed to be known to every person, and there is a duty thrown upon everyone who acquires a title or interest in lands to register his title, and when he does not do so it must be taken that he fail to do so at his peril\u2014that he does so knowing that he is failing in that portion of his duty to himself in securing a proper title to the property which he has purchased. I consider the Registry Act makes the law totally different to what it ever was before in regard to notice, and I agree with the doctrine that actual notice amounting to fraud is necessary to void the operation of the Registry Acts. If the Registry Act, or the provisions and objects of it, can be set aside to enable a party to get the benefit of a conveyance for an easement, he may obtain such a benefit as would destroy the value of the property to the party purchasing it to a large extent. That would, therefore, defeat the object that the legislature had in view. The legislature, in view of passing the Registry Acts, requires everybody to register any conveyance he receives with regard to land and makes it void as regards the next subsequent purchaser unless it is registered. That being the case, a party purchasing is presumed to know what the law is, and to act upon it so as to protect his own rights, and when a person searches the registry office and finds no conveyance, he has a right to assume that there is no conveyance which will interfere with the right of the party to convey him the title that he has purchased. I therefore, in petto, give my views as to what I think the registry laws are applicable to, at least in Nova Scotia, and I agree with my brethren that this appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe declaration in this action, which is one of tort alleged to have been committed on lands of the plaintiff in his own possession and in the possession of his tenants, the reversion being in him at the time of the committal of the alleged wrongs, contains five counts; but as the whole substance of the tort complained of and relied upon is contained in the second count it will be sufficient to set out that count, wherein the plaintiff complains:\nThat the plaintiff, before and at the time of the committing of the grievances hereinafter mentioned, was and still is lawfully possessed of a certain messuage and building situate on Hollis street, in the city of Halifax, that the defendant wrongfully and injuriously erected and kept erected a building situate on Hollis street aforesaid, contiguous and adjoining to the said messuage and building of the plaintiff, and used and continues to use the wall of the plaintiff's said building as and for a wall for the defendant's said building, and pierced holes in said wall, and inserted and kept inserted therein beams and timbers and other materials of defendant's said building, and pierced holes in the chimney of plaintiff's said building and inserted and kept inserted in said chimney divers stove pipes and fire places, and filled up the said chimney with soot from defendant's said building, and removed the cornice from plaintiff's said building, and also wrongfully and injuriously put, placed and built a certain wall and projection in connection therewith over and upon the said building and wall of the plaintiff, and the same so put, placed and built as aforesaid, kept and continued for a long space of time, and by reason of the premises the said roof and wall of the plaintiff's building were weakened and injured, and the plaintiff was and is prevented from building upwards and adding to his said wall and building, and by reason of the premises the plaintiff has been greatly annoyed and incommoded in the use, possession and enjoyment of his said messuage and building, and the same have become thereby and are greatly damaged, deteriorated and lessened in value.\nTo the whole declaration the defendant pleads several pleas. It is only, however, necessary to set out three, namely:\u2014\nSecondly. That the plaintiff was not possessed as alleged.\nSeventhly. A special plea of a grant under seal of one Samuel Caldwell, while he was owner in fee of the said premises now of the plaintiff, and before the plaintiff had any estate therein, to the defendant to do the several acts complained of, and the doing of the several acts under and in virtue of such grant while the said Samuel Caldwell continued so seized, and that the alleged trespasses were and are the enjoyment by the defendants of the rights and easements so granted by the said Samuel Caldwell. And eighthly:\nFor an eighth plea to said declaration and for a defence upon equitable grounds, the defendant says that long before the plaintiff became possessed of or entitled to the said lands and premises in said declaration set forth one, Samuel Caldwell was the owner thereof and of the said building known as the Victoria Block, then and ever since standing thereon, and the south wall of said building was the northern boundary of a lot of land belonging to the defendant, and of which he then was and and ever since has been the owner in fee; that the defendant being desirous of pulling down the building then upon his said lot and erecting thereon a new and more valuable building, and also being desirous of using the south end wall of said Victoria Block as the north end wall of his said new building, as far as the same could be made available for such purposes, entered into an agreement under seal with the said Samuel Caldwell on or about the 22nd day of August, 1859, which agreement is in the words following, that is to say: Memorandum of agreement made the 22nd day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, between Samuel Caldwell, of Halifax, Esquire, of the one part, and James Hunter, of the same place, gas-fitter, of the other part. Whereas the said James Hunter lately purchased the lot of land, dwelling house and premises situate on Hollis street, in the city of Halifax, adjoining the south end of the brick building called Victoria Block, lately in the occupation and possession of Henry Fryer, esquire, as an office, and by his tenants as a dwelling house, and the said James Hunter being about to pull down the said dwelling house and to erect on the site thereof a brick building with an iron front and four stories high, suitable for his trade and business, and whereas the said Samuel Caldwell, as the owner of the said Victoria Block, hath consented and agreed with the said James Hunter, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, to permit and allow the said James Hunter, his contractors, builders and workmen to make use of the south end or wall of the said Victoria building in the erection of the said new store so as to save to the said James Hunter the expense of a new wall or end to his new building about to be erected. Now this agreement witnesseth that the said Samuel Caldwell, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said James Hunter, his executors, administrators and assigns in manner following, that is to say: That he the said Samuel Caldwell, for and in consideration of the sum of seventy-five pounds currency to him in hand paid by the said James Hunter, he the said Samuel Caldwell hereby agrees to permit and allow the said James Hunter, his contractors, builders and workmen, to make use of the south end or wall of the brick building or Victoria block in every way that may be requisite and necessary to save the said James Hunter the expense of a new north wall to his new building, and to pierce the end of the said wall to allow the ends of the timbers and joists of the new building to be inserted therein, and to use the south end wall of the Victoria block in all respects to the depth and height of the new building as if the said James Hunter had built a new north wall for his own building. And as it is intended that the new building shall be higher than the Victoria block, it is further agreed that the said James Hunter and his contractors and workmen may raise a new wall on the top of the south end or cornice of the said Victoria block and continue the same upwards to the full height and depth of the said new building, and also to cut a hole or holes in the chimney now erected for stove pipes and to have the right and privilege of using the same at all times hereafter for that purpose. The said James Hunter hereby agrees to raise the said chimney as high as may be necessary and to make good the new wall on the top of the present finish or cornice of the Victoria block and round the chimney to prevent leakage, and further that in the erection of the said new building as little damage as possible shall be done to the south wall of the Victoria building, and that all holes or any other damage shall be filled up and made good by the said James Hunter.\nIn witness whereof the said parties have hereunto their hands and seals subscribed and set the day and year first above written.\nSigned, JAMES HUNTER. (L.S.)\nSAMUEL CALDWELL. (L.S.)\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered\nin the presence of\nWM. ROBINSON.\nAnd thereupon the said James Hunter, having paid the sum mentioned in the said agreement as the consideration for the rights and easements thereby granted, pulled down the building then standing upon his said lot, and at a very large expense erected a new and valuable building thereon adjoining said Victoria block, and made use of the said south end wall of Victoria block in every way that was requisite and necessary so as to save the defendant the expense of a new north wall to his said building, and did pierce the end of the said wall to allow the ends of the timbers and joists of said new building to be inserted therein, and the same were inserted therein, and the defendant used the said south wall of Victoria block in all respects to the depth and height of said new building as if the defendant had built a new north wall for his building, and did raise a new wall on the top of the south cornice of the said Victoria block and continued the same upwards to the full height and depth of defendant's said new building, and did cut holes in the chimney of said Victoria block for the stove pipes of and from said building of defendant, and did insert defendant's stove pipes therein and has ever since used and enjoyed said south wall of said Victoria block and said chimney and said cornice, for the purpose and in the manner aforesaid, and his enjoyment and use thereof has been visible, public and notorious, and he was in the enjoyment thereof when the plaintiff became the owner of or entitled to the reversion in the said land and premises and said Victoria block, and the same was known to the plaintiff, and he had notice of the foregoing facts and circumstances when he became the owner thereof; and he took the same subject to said easements and said Tight enjoyed by defendant as aforesaid; and said alleged trespasses were the said use and enjoyment thereof by defendant.\nTo these pleas the defendant replies:\u2014 1st. By joining issue upon all of them\u2014and further, 4th, as to the 7th plea, that the deed therein alleged was not the deed of the said Samuel Caldwell.\n5th. As to the said 7th plea, that there was and is no such deed and grant as is set up in said plea, and the alleged rights, easements and privileges were not, nor was any of them granted to the said defendant as alleged, and the plaintiff, when he become owner of the said building, close and messuage, had no notice of such rights, easements and privileges, and did not become such owner subject thereto as alleged.\n6th. As to said 7th plea, that the alleged deed was a license and not otherwise, and the same was revoked before the plaintiff became such owner of said building, land, messuage and close\u2014before the alleged grievances and trespasses, as the defendant well knew.\n8th. As to the said 8th plea\u2014that the agreement set out in said plea is not the agreement of the said Samuel Caldwell, and he did not agree as alleged.\n9th. As to 8th plea\u2014that he denies each and every allegation and statement contained in said plea.\n10th. And for tenth replication\u2014as to the said 8th plea, and for a defence upon equitable grounds, the plaintiff says that the sum mentioned in the said agreement was not nor was any part thereof paid as alleged, and the said agreement and license thereby given were rescinded, cancelled and revoked before the grievance and trespasses set out in the plaintiff's declaration, as the defendant well knew.\n11th. And for an eleventh replication the plaintiff as to the said 8th plea, and for a defence upon equitable grounds, says that the plaintiff when he became the owner of the said land and premises, and the said Victoria block, or entitled to said reversion as set out in said declaration, had no notice or knowledge of the alleged agreement, or said alleged facts and circumstances set out in said plea, and did not take the said lands and premises and said Victoria block subject to said alleged easements and rights as alleged in said plea, and purchased and acquired, and became owner of the said land free from any of the said alleged easements and rights.\nThe plaintiff also replied, by way of new assignment, but it is unnecessary to refer to this, because it was not suggested at the trial that the plaintiff was proceeding for, or that the defendant had done anything not mentioned in the deeds pleaded in the 7th and 8th pleas.\nThe plaintiff thus joined issue on the pleas of not guilty and not possessed, and also upon all the material matters alleged in the 7th and 8th pleas.\nThe 4th replication, which is to the 7th plea, and which denies that the deed therein pleaded as the deed of Samuel Cadwell is his deed, is but a repetition of the denial of one of the material matters alleged in the 7th plea and necessary to be proved in order to sustain that plea, and was therefore a matter already put in issue by the joinder in issue.\nThe 5th replication as to that part of it which denies that there was, or is such a deed as that set out in the 7th plea, is but another mode of repeating the 4th replication, and as to the residue is either a denial of facts not material to the establishment of the substance of the plea, or which if material had already been put in issue by the joinder in issue, or it is matter relied upon as a conclusion of law, namely, that the plaintiff did not become owner of the premises in question, subject, as had been alleged in the plea to the terms of that deed, because he had not, as he alleges he had not, notice of the easements and rights mentioned in the plea having been granted as is therein alleged when he became owner of the premises consisting of the Victoria building. The 8th replication is open to the same observations as to the 8th plea as is the 4th replication as to the 7th plea.\nThe ninth replication is a precise repetition in a different form, of the joinder in issue. The tenth replication is an attempt to set up as a matter of fact the nonpayment of the sum of money which is in the deed set out in the eighth plea, admitted under the hand and seal of Samuel Caldwell to have been paid in hand; and to offer as a point of law that thereby, that is by such alleged non-payment, the deed set out in the plea became rescinded, cancelled and revoked before ever the defendant did the acts complained of.\nThe eleventh replication, while admitting the execution of the deed set out in the eighth plea, sets up the claim that in point of law or equity the plaintiff, when he acquired and became owner of the Victoria building, did so free from the easements and rights mentioned in the deed set out in the plea, for the reason that, as he alleges, he had no notice or knowledge of the agreement so set out in the eighth plea when he purchased.\nThe appeal case brought before us does not show what course the defendant adopted in relation to the above fifth, tenth and eleventh replications. The case was argued as if he had joined issue thereon, and in so far as the merits of the case can be affected we may assume this to have been done.\nThe case was brought down for trial before a judge without a jury, and, briefly, it may be said that the acts complained of appeared to have been all committed in the years 1859 and 1860, and in the manner and under the authority of the deed set out in the eighth plea. It was also proved that the \u00a375 in the deed mentioned was paid to one Nash, at whose request Caldwell, as he himself testified, executed the deed of the 22nd August, 1859. That Nash was the person at that time beneficially interested in the premises in question would appear from the fact that by deed dated the 15th July, 1862, Caldwell, for the expressed consideration of five shillings, conveyed the premises under the description of \"The Victoria Buildings\" to Nash in fee. It was further proved that by deed dated the 15th July, 1863, registered the 1st August, 1863, Nash conveyed the premises by the same description to one Forman and that Forman, by deed dated the 26th of July and registered the 27th July, 1870, conveyed the same premises with another lot of land to the president, directors and company of the Bank of Nova Scotia in trust to sell the same, and to apply the proceeds in liquidation of a debt due by Forman to the bank. It was further proved that the deed of the 22nd August, 1859, was registered on the 20th May, 1871, and that by deed dated the 1st November, 1872, and registered the 20th January, 1873, the Bank of Nova Scotia conveyed the premises in question to the plaintiff in fee under a special description concluding as follows: \"The property now in description being known as Victoria Buildings.\"\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, before whom the case was tried, rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon the facts and law, which verdict the court in term, by a judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice himself, set aside and entered for the defendant, and issued a rule for judgment for the defendant thereon. It is from this judgment and rule that the plaintiff has appealed.\nNow, from the above statement of the pleadings, it is obvious that, inasmuch as it appeared that all the acts complained of were committed in 1859 and 1860, when Caldwell was seized in fee in possession of the premises now owned by the plaintiff, and twelve years before the plaintiff had any estate or interest therein\/the continuing existence of a house so erected while Caldwell was seized in fee could not give to the plaintiff any cause of action of the nature of the present one which is in trespass. The issue joined upon the plea of not possessed raised directly the question whether the plaintiff was possessed of the Victoria building at the time the defendant did the acts complained of, and this issue, upon the evidence, could be found only in favor of the defendant, and is conclusive against the plaintiff's right to recover upon this record. It was suggested that under the doctrine of relation, the plaintiff, although he became entitled only in November, 1872, twelve years after the complete erection of the defendant's house, which the plaintiff desires now to have pulled down, can recover in this action as for a trespass committed before he became entitled, being continued after, but that doctrine of relation applies only where the original act was a trespass, the continuance of which is said to constitute a continuing trespass; it has never, that I am aware of, been applied so as to make an act, perfectly legal when completely executed, acquire by mere continuance the character of a trespass committed against a person, who, at the time of the completion of the act, had no estate or interest whatever in the land upon which the act was done, but who subsequently acquires the land while the thing so done remains upon it.\nIt was suggested that the defendant not having withdrawn his house from the support of the south wall of the Victoria building, upon plaintiff's notice to him to do so after the plaintiff's purchase, constituted an act of trespass sufficient to support this action, but the answer to that is obvious, namely, that nonfeasance never can in itself constitute an act of trespass[64]. Then as to the 7th and 8th pleas\u2014these pleas respectively set up a good and sufficient grant at common law executed by the owner in fee of the Victoria building, under his hand and seal, granting to the defendant the easement, right and privilege to do the several acts now complained of; and the pleas allege the complete performance of those acts by the erection of the defendant's house under and in pursuance of the provisions of the deed granting the easement. These pleas, if true, show a complete defence in law to the plaintiff's action, and the facts pleaded in them have neither been disputed on the record nor disproved; in fact, on the contrary, they have been admitted upon the record and proved also to be true in fact in every particular. They have been admitted upon the record by the replications thereto, which allege by way of answer to the facts pleaded in the defendant's plea, that the plaintiff, when he purchased and became owner of the premises in question called the Victoria building, had no notice of the facts relied upon in the pleas. Now, as to the mere matter of fact involved in the issue joined upon this replication, it sufficiently appears that the plaintiff had full opportunity of observing the position and precise condition of that particular thing which he was purchasing under the designation of \"the Victoria buildings,\" and I must say that in my judgment it would be competent and proper for a jury, or a judge acting as a jury, to apply to the determination of that issue the rule laid down in Allen v. Seckham[65], namely, that where one purchases property where a visible state of things exists, which could not legally exist without the property being subject to some burden, he should be taken to have notice of the extent and nature of that burden.\nCommon sense does not, in my judgment, permit a doubt to exist, that the erection of the south wall of the Victoria building (which building as it then stood appears to me to have been what the plaintiff was purchasing,) above the roof of that building to the height of another story in defendant's house by which the defendant's house exceeded the Victoria building in height, and which south wall so raised supported the roof of the defendants house, constituted such a visible state of things that no intending purchaser seeing the building at all, could fail to see; and such a state of things should have conveyed, and should have been held to have conveyed, to the mind of the intending purchaser, when purchasing, full and actual notice and knowledge, that the defendant was in the actual visible enjoyment of an easement in the south wall of the house the plaintiff was about purchasing for the support of the roof of the defendants house; and that he had such notice and knowledge is in substance and effect the finding of the judges of the court below acting as jurors upon this question; and they would, in my judgment, have been justified in finding, and should have found, as a mixed proposition of law and fact, that what the plaintiff contracted to purchase under the designation of the \"Victoria buildings,\" and what was in fact conveyed to him by the terms of his deed, namely, \"the property now in description being known as Victoria buildings\" was that building, just as it then stood, with its south wall constituting the support of the adjoining house in the row just as if the description had been the building known as No. 2 in a named row of buildings erected upon the east side of Hollis street; but, wholly apart from these considerations, upon what principle could the plaintiff's ignorance of acts done by the defendant twelve years previously under a legal common law grant, executed by the owner in fee of the premises upon which the acts were done, have the effect of attaching to the continuance of the house so erected the character of a trespass on the plaintiff's possession upon his acquiring title by purchase of the premises upon which the acts so authorized were done? Such a replication plainly admits the grant as pleaded, and that the acts were done, and in pursuance thereof, and offers no answer in law to the defendant's pleas. If such ignorance as is pleaded would give to the plaintiff any locus standi in equity entitling him to consider the defendant's house, so erected 12 years previously to the plaintiff's purchase, a nuisance which, upon purchasing without notice of defendant's right to do the acts complained of at the time they were done, the plaintiff could cause to be abated or enjoined against, then the replication is bad as a departure from the legal cause of action stated in the declaration, and can entitle the plaintiff to no relief upon this record. Such an equity, if such exist, must be stated on the record with a full statement of the facts which give rise to the equity expanded upon a bill in equity[66].\nIn the argument before us the contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff was that by reason of the Nova Scotia Registry Act, section 19 of chapter 79 of the revised statutes, fourth series, the deed of the 22nd August, 1869, although registered on the 20th May, 1871, eighteen months before the plaintiff acquired any interest in the premises in question, was void as against him, and that for this reason this action could be maintained. The learned counsel for the defendant objected that the record opened no such point, and upon the following day expressed his willingness to withdraw that objection, and that the case should be considered as if that point had been raised by the pleadings.\nFor my own part I must say that in my opinion no court should in any case accede to any such suggestion, although consented to by counsel, unless the amendment be, in fact, made at the time, so that the argument may be proceeded with in view of the new pleadings, and the court be placed in the position of calling for an argument in support of the sufficiency of the pleadings in point of law, if such should appear doubtful, and be also in the position of being able to see before the close of the argument whether any new issue in fact raised by the added pleadings requires further investigation before a jury; for in my opinion this court should not, if it has the power, allow any new pleading to be put upon the record which is not framed in such a manner as to accord with, and be supported by, the evidence already given, and to be a good and sufficient answer in law to the pleas pleaded by the defendant in bar of the plaintiff's action; for so long as the defendant's seventh and eighth pleas remain unanswered the defendant must recover upon this record, as indeed he must with the plea of not possessed proved and established beyond dispute in his favor.\nNow this was not done in this case, but the argument was proceeded with and was closed upon the record as it came up to us from the court below; but ten days after the close of that argument the plaintiff appears to have filed with the registrar of this court a replication, as follows:\u2014\n\"And for a further replication to the defendant's seventh plea the plaintiff says that the alleged deed or grant from said Caldwell to the defendant was not recorded in the registry of deeds until the year 1871, and that said Caldwell had long previously to said recording, to wit, in the year 1862, conveyed the lands and building now of the plaintiff and referred to in the plaintiff's declaration to one Nash, who had recorded his deed thereof, and the said Nash had sold and conveyed the said land and building to one Forman, who was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser thereof, for value, without notice of the said deed or grant, and the said Forman had sold and conveyed the said land and building to the said Bank of Nova Scotia, who was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser thereof, for value, without notice of said deed or grant, and who also had recorded the deed thereof to the said bank, and all the said conveyances and sales mentioned herein had been made, and all the deeds mentioned herein were recorded in the registry for the county of Halifax, in which county the said lands and building are situate, prior to the recording of the deed or grant set up in said seventh plea.\"\nAt the foot of this replication is added a note to the effect following:\u2014\n\"The same matter is to be considered as replied to \"the eighth plea in addition to the replications already \"pleaded and as a part of such replications.\"\nI stop not now to enquire whether the brevity which is so conspicuous in this mode of replying to the eighth plea has so much merit in it as to justify us in adopting this novel and unprecedented form upon a document which is intended to be preserved as a record of the issues joined between the parties upon which the court pronounces judgment in favor of one or other of the parties, and which being so preserved, might be regarded as establishing a precedent for this concise method of pleading to be followed in other cases. There appear to me to be matters of still graver importance to be considered arising out of the replication which is set out at large to the seventh plea and the rejoinder thereto, and which should lead us to the conclusion not to allow these pleadings to be now added to the record.\nAnd firstly, as to the substance of the replication, it is to be observed that it admits everything averred in the seventh plea, namely, that all the acts complained of by the plaintiff in his declaration as wrongs and trespasses committed upon his property and his possession, were done and legally completed by the defendant before the plaintiff had any estate whatever in the premises, and were so legally done under in pursuance of the provisions of a good and sufficient grant executed under the hand and seal of the then owner in fee of the premises in question, and while he continued to be such owner, and that the alleged acts which the plaintiff complains of as trespasses consist merely in the continuance of the enjoyment by the defendant of the easement so granted. To avoid this confession the replication sets up the registry of a deed for value executed to one Forman by one Nash, who may be said to have claimed title to the premises in question by deed, not for value, from the defendant's grantor, and who was a party privy to the deed executed to the defendant, and who received the consideration therefor, and the registry also of a deed for value executed by Forman to the Bank of Nova Scotia before the registry by the defendant of the deed relied upon by him in his seventh plea, which deed, however, is admitted to have been registered long before the plaintiff purchased, and the replication adds that neither Forman nor the bank at the time of their respective purchases had any notice of the deed or grant relied on by the defendant. And if we are to consider the replication to be upon the record as pleaded to the eighth plea (notwithstanding the peculiarity in the form of pleading it), then it admits, in addition to the above, that the plaintiff when he purchased had notice of the grant to the defendant, and of his having done all the acts (complained of as trespasses) under and in pursuance of the terms of such grant. Now, it being admitted that the acts complained of, when done, were legally done in virtue of a good and sufficient deed authorizing them to be done, assuming for the present the contention of the plaintiff to be well founded, that the registry of the deeds to Forman and the bank of Nova Scotia before the registry of the deed of grant to the defendant deprived the latter of all right to continue any longer to avail himself of the easement granted to him by his prior legal grant completely executed though it was, still the plaintiff's right to recover in this action would not be advanced, nor would the defendant's right to have judgment in his favor upon the seventh and eighth pleas, as also upon his plea of not possessed, be at all prejudiced, for the reasons I have already before stated, namely, that the mere continuance of an act perfectly legal when completely executed cannot become an act of trespass committed against a person, a perfect stranger to the possession, and the title, at the time the acts were completely executed, upon his acquiring title to the premises with the thing so done remaining upon them; and that the nonfeasance of the defendant in not acceding to the plaintiff's demand to remove his the defendant's, house from continuing to rest upon the south wall of the Victoria building, after the plaintiff's purchase of that building, cannot constitute an act of trespass.\nThe plaintiff, in virtue of the prior registry of the deeds to Forman and the bank, in priority of title with whom the plaintiff claims, may perhaps, I do not say it does, but it may perhaps give to the plaintiff a right to file a bill in equity to attain the object sought to be attained by this action of trespass, but in face of the matters abundantly proved, and indeed admitted on the record, the plaintiff cannot sustain the present action. When such a bill shall be filed, it will, in my opinion, be time enough to consider what effect (if any) the registry laws of Nova Scotia have upon the facts appearing in the present case. In the view which I take it is quite beside any question which is or can be raised in the present action to inquire whether a deed of the nature of that of the 22nd August, 1859, granting only an easement of the character therein described, and which does not profess to be, and never was intended to be, a deed of land, is of such a nature as to be avoided by non-registry within the provisions of sec. 19 of ch. 70 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 4th series, which enacts that\u2014\nDeeds or mortgages of lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration who shall first register his deed or mortgage of such lands.\nBesides joining issue on the plaintiff's replication above added, the defendant for a further rejoinder to said added replication says, that when said lot of land and premises of plaintiff were conveyed to the several grantees in said replication mentioned, the defendant had done and performed the several acts set out in the eighth plea under and by virtue of said deed, grant or agreement from said Samuel Caldwell in said plea referred to and set forth, and which are the alleged grievances, and the same were visible and apparent to the plaintiff and said grantees before and at the time when they became entitled to said property, and they were put upon inquiry and had notice of said privileges, easements and rights acquired by defendant in and under said agreement, deed or grant of said Caldwell in over and upon said land and property of the plaintiff.\nNow, if this rejoinder had stopped with the averment that the acts complained of were all completely done and performed before any of the grantees mentioned in the replication had purchased, it would, in my opinion, have afforded a complete answer to the replication as relying upon the position asserted in the plea, that acts so perfected could not be treated by the plaintiff as trespasses committed to his possession after his purchase; but the defendant proceeds to aver, not only that the same were visible and apparent to the several grantees before they respectively purchased, but that they had notice of the privileges, easements and rights required by the defendant in and under said agreement, deed or grant of said Caldwell in, over and upon said land and property of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff does not appear to have joined issue upon this rejoinder, so that either the added pleadings have resulted in no issue, and for that reason should not be allowed to be put upon the record, or we must add the joinder for the plaintiff, and in the latter case we have an issue joined upon a material fact as to which no evidence whatever has yet been given. Now, what right has the court to pass judgment in respect of a matter of fact when no issue joined between the parties in respect of such matter has been found in favor of either party by the constituted tribunal for that purpose? What right has this court to constitute itself a jury for the purpose of finding the fact? or if it has such right, by what law is it enabled to determine the fact so in issue, without any evidence being offered or any opportunity being given to the parties to offer evidence upon the subject? For, whether Forman or the bank had or had not notice of the grant of the easement to the defendant, which is affirmed upon one side and denied upon the other, there is not a particle of evidence as yet given. I confess I am unable to see upon what principle we can countenance a proceeding so utterly novel and unprecedented.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion, that we are not justified in permitting the record sent to us to be altered in the manner which is proposed, and that our judgment should be upon the record as sent to us. At the same time, I must say, that even as altered, I cannot see any issue joined between the parties upon which it would be possible for us to order a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff to be entered, which would be supported by the evidence which has been given. The same remarks apply to the other rejoinders which, in in their form, adopt the looseness of the plaintiff in his manner of replying to the eighth plea. Upon the whole, I can see nothing whatever to justify a verdict in favor of the plaintiff either upon the record as sent up to us, or upon it if altered in the manner proposed.\nThis action, as framed, cannot, in my opinion, be sustained, for the reasons given, and I cannot see anything of a meritorious character in the plaintiff's case which would justify us in allowing any alteration in the record to be made, if any could be made, which would entitle the plaintiff to succeed in compelling the defendant to pull down his house, and in so perpetrating what, as it appears to me, would be a great injustice and wrong to the defendant, and thereby deprive the defendant of the full defence of title by prescription which he would have to any future attempt by the plaintiff to perpetrate so great a wrong.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the only judgment we should give upon this record is that the rule granted by the court below to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and to enter a verdict and judgment thereon for the defendant should be sustained, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Wallace Graham.\nSolicitor for respondent: Peter Lynch.\n[1] Pp. 285-292.\n[2] Pp. 60-62, 92.\n[3] 14 Pick. 226.\n[4] 2 Pick. 184.\n[5] 16 Mass. 406.\n[6] Pp. 428, 435.\n[7] 11 Ch.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau, and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nInsolvent Act, 1875\u2014Trader\u2014Pleading.\nThis was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making the rule nisi taken out by the respondents absolute to set aside verdict for plaintiff and enter judgment for the defendants. The action was brought by C. as assignee of L. P. F., under the Insolvent Act of 1875, for several trespasses alleged to have been committed on the property known as the Shubenacadie Canal property, and for conversion by C. et al. to their own use of the ice taken off the lakes through which that canal was intended to run.\nThe declaration contained six counts, the plaintiff claiming as assignee of F. Among the pleas were denials of committing the alleged wrongs, of the property being that of the plaintiff, and of his possession of it, the last plea being that \"the said plaintiff was not, nor is such assignee as alleged.\"\nAfter the trial both counsel declined addressing the Judge, and it was agreed that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff with $10 damages, subject to the opinion of the court, that the parties should be entitled to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and that the court should have power to enter judgment for or against the defendants with costs. A rule nisi for a new trial to be granted accordingly, an I filed.\nThe rule was taken out as follows:\u2014\"On reading the minutes of the learned Judge who tried the cause, and the papers on file herein, and on motion, it is ordered that the verdict entered herein formally by consent subject to the opinion of the court, with power to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and with power to the court to enter judgment for or against defendants, with costs, be set aside with costs, and a new trial granted herein.\"\nThis rule was made absolute in the following terms:\u2014\"On argument, etc., it is ordered that the rule nisi be made absolute with costs and judgment entered for the defendants against the plaintiff with costs.\" Thereupon plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and it was\nHeld (Henry, J., dissenting), that by traversing the allegation of plaintiff being assignee, the defendants put in issue the fact implied in the averment, that the plaintiff was assignee in insolvency, and that F. Was a trader within the meaning of the Insolvent Act of 1869, and as the evidence did not establish that F. bought or sold in the course of any trade or business, or got his livelihood by buying and selling, that the plaintiff failed to prove this issue.\nPer Gwynne, J: Assuming F. to be a trader still the defendants were entitled to judgment upon the merits, which had been argued at length. That the agreement at nisi prius authorized the court to render a verdict for plaintiff or defendant according as they should consider either party upon the law and the facts entitled; that the court, having exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon it by this agreement, and rendered judgment for the defendants, this court was also bound to give judgment on the merits, and as judgment of the court below in favor of the defendants was substantially correct to sustain it; and it having been objected that as the rule nisi asked for a new trial the rule absolute in favor of defendants was erroneous, that such an objection was too technical to be allowed to prevail, and that the rule nisi, having, as it did, recited the agreement at nisi prius, and the court below having rendered a verdict for the defendants, it should be upheld, except as to the plea of liberum tenementum, which should be found for the plaintiff or struck off the record, and that to order a new trial could be but to protract a useless litigation at great expense.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making the rule nisi taken out by the respondents absolute to set aside verdict for plaintiff and enter judgment for the defendants.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, hereinafter given. Mr. Thompson, Q. C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe verdict in this case was set aside upon the ground that the insolvent was not a trader, and therefore his assignee could not recover in an action of trespass. I will first argue this point and then discuss the merits.\nThe certificate from the officer of the court was at least prim\u00e2 facie evidence of Fairbanks being an insolvent and having regularly and properly assigned, and of the plaintiff's appointment, and of the regularity of all proceedings antecedent to the certificate[1].\nMoreover the denial of Fairbanks being a trader should have been made explicitly in the pleas, especially in view of the following section, 152 of chapter 94, revised statutes of N. S., 4th series: \"The general issue and all general pleas are abolished, and every pleading shall specify particularly and concisely the facts intended to be denied.\" Church-wardens v. Vaughan[2].\nIt was not necessary, as the Supreme Court of N. S. seemed to adjudge it to be, that in order to make the insolvent a trader within the meaning of the Act, he should have assets and books which had resulted from his trading business. Exparte Dewdney[3]; Doe v. Laurance[4]; Baillie v. Grant[5].\nOn the question of fact as to Fairbanks having been a trader, there was some evidence at least for the plaintiff and none for the defendants. The assignee, in his evidence, says: \"Fairbanks bought and sold all sorts of things. I had dealings with him. He bought oats and wood and iron.\" The Supreme Court said: \"We all do that when necessary,\" and thence concluded that Fairbanks was not a trader[6].\nThe verdict in the plaintiff's favor, therefore, should not have been disturbed, and was a finding of that issue in plaintiff's favor.\nThe learned counsel then argued at length on the merits of the case, claiming that the plaintiff showed a complete title to the locus, and proved the trespasses thereon, but the Supreme Court of Canada having affirmed the judgment on the ground that Fairbanks was not a trader, this branch of the argument is omitted.\nMr. Rigby, Q. C., for respondent:\nIt was upon a consent of the parties in the case that the whole matter was referred to the court in banc. It was \"agreed that a verdict shall be entered for the plaintiff, with $10 damages, subject to the opinion of the court, that the parties shall be entitled to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and that the court shall have power to enter judgment for or against the defendants, with costs.\" Now, the case was heard before the full court, and I contend that the court has as a matter of fact decided that respondent was not a trader, and if this judgment upon this matter of fact can be sustained by any evidence, this court cannot interfere. The court below was put by consent of parties in the position of a jury. What was put in by plaintiff was only prim\u00e2 facie evidence, and in order to rebut it, we cross-examined the insolvent, and proved that his insolvency had only relation to lands. I contend that as the assets and liabilities of Fairbanks had reference entirely to this canal property, unless he can be considered as a trader in relation to that, he was not subject to the provisions of the act.\nNone of the trades, callings, or employments specified in section 1 of the Insolvent Act of 1875, include that alleged to have been followed by Fairbanks, nor was his a trade, calling or employment like that of any of them; besides, the property in question was not of a character to admit of its being made the subject of trade; it could be serviceable as a canal property in its entirety only. See Clarke's Insolvent Law[7]. In re Cleland[8]; Stuart v. Sloper[9]. It is urged also that we did not raise the issue of plaintiff not being a trader. I contend that by denying title in plaintiff, the burthen of proof was on them. See McMahon v. McArdle[10].\n[The learned counsel then argued that the title to the land in question was not in plaintiff.]\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThese were actions brought by the plaintiff, as assignee under the Insolvent Act of 1875, of Lewis P. Fairbanks, an insolvent, to recover damages for an alleged breaking and entering certain lands, and lands covered with water of the plaintiff, as such assignee, digging the soil thereof, throwing earth, &c., thereon, and cutting and carrying away the ice formed on the said land covered with water, the property of plaintiff, as such assignee, and converting the same. The defendants pleaded several pleas, inter alia, \"that the said Wm. H. Creighton was not, nor is, such assignee as alleged,\" An objection was taken at the trial, and at the argument, that Fairbanks was not shown to have been a trader, and that plaintiff, as assignee, took nothing by the assignment, purporting to be made by Fairbanks, under the Insolvent Act of 1875, unless he was a trader within the meaning of that Act. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were of opinion that Fairbanks was not shown to have been a trader within the meaning of the Act, and therefore plaintiff could not succeed in the action. From this judgment the present appeal is taken. The plaintiff offered no evidence of the insolvent having been a trader\u2014the only evidence on the point was brought out by defendants' counsel on cross-examination of the plaintiff, and is as follows: W. H. Creighton, cross-examined:\u2014\nFairbanks bought and sold all sorts of things. I had dealings with him. He bought oats and wood and iron. No debts or assets of that kind. The insolvent business has relation solely to land. He handed me no books of business, nor cash book. His books had reference only to the Canal property; other lands of his had been wound up. I gave no bond for this estate; it was not required.\nThe plaintiff was not re-examined to explain, if he could, favorably to himself, that the insolvent had bought and sold, and whether as a trader or not, or what the nature of his dealings were with the insolvent. There is not the slightest evidence that Fairbanks purchased articles of merchandise for the purpose of selling them again at a profit, or that he bought the articles referred to with any intention of selling again with a view to profit, or that he was considered a trader by any person who knew or dealt with him.\nLewis P. Fairbanks, the insolvent, was examined, and he does not appear to have been interrogated, or to have said one word, as to having been a trader, or as to his dealings in any way, nor do any other witnesses. The burthen was clearly on the plaintiff under the pleadings to establish that the insolvent was a trader. As it appears by the evidence that the insolvent \"had no debts or assets of any kind;\" \"that his business had relation solely to land;\" \"that he handed the plaintiff, his assignee, no books of business, nor cash book; that the books he had had reference only to the canal property;\" and \"other lands of his had been wound up and as the objection was taken at the trial that there was no proof that Fairbanks was a trader, and as Fairbanks himself was on the stand and examined, and if he had been a trader could have established that fact beyond all question, I think, so far from the fact of Fairbanks haying been a trader having been proved, the Court below, had it been necessary, which it was not, would have been quite justified under the circumstances, and the fair inferences to draw therefrom, in coming to the conclusion that Fairbanks was not a trader.\nThe plaintiff in the court below, and also on the argument before this court, invoked the 144th section of the Insolvent Act of 1875, as establishing that the assignment itself was prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the insolvent being a trader. This section enacts that:\nThe deed of assignment and transfer shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence in all courts, whether civil or criminal, of such appointment (the appointment of the assignee), and of the regularity of all proceedings at the time thereof and antecedent thereto.\nBut this cannot possibly avail the plaintiff for two conclusive reasons. In the first place, whether the insolvent was a trader or not was not matter of procedure, and proceedings having been taken against him as a trader, the deed of assignment by sec. 144, is made prim\u00e2 facie evidence only of the regularity of all such proceedings, but no evidence whatever of the insolvent having been a trader to justify such proceedings. If the statute, however, had the effect claimed for it, the deed is only made prim\u00e2 facie evidence, and the evidence, in the case rebuts such prim\u00e2 facie evidence and uncontroverted, unexplained and unanswered, established that the insolvent was not a trader, at any rate sufficiently so to overcome the prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the deed; and there being no evidence of the insolvent having been a trader, and though the question was distinctly raised by the pleadings, and at the trial, and the plaintiff not having attempted to prove that he was, the circumstances before referred to and the fact that the plaintiff and the insolvent both were allowed to leave the witness stand without being questioned on this point\u2014a matter peculiarly within their own knowledge\u2014are conclusive to my mind that the buying and selling referred to by the plaintiff was not a buying and selling by the insolvent as a trader, and that his business transactions, which it is said by plaintiff were solely in relation to land, were not only no evidence whatever of a trading within the meaning of the Insolvent Act of 1875, but the whole evidence justifies the contrary inference, viz.:\u2014that he was not a trader.\nAs the court below based their judgment on this point alone, as it is a perfect answer to plaintiff's case, and refrained from expressing any opinion on the other questions raised in the case, I feel I should be exceeding my appellate duties in discussing or determining questions not passed on by the court below, and not necessary for the determination of this appeal.\nHad the rule nisi been taken out for entering judgment for the defendants, I think it should have been made absolute in those terms, but as the rule nisi taken out in the court below appears to have been only \"to set aside the verdict with costs\" and a new trial granted, it is admitted that, in accordance with the practice in Nova Scotia, that the court can only make the rule absolute to the extent asked in the rule nisi. I believe it is a rule that the court will never go beyond the rule nisi and grant more than is there asked for.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI think the rule absolute granted by the court below should be modified so as to make it a rule to enter a verdict for the defendants, and, subject to that alteration, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. By traversing the plaintiff's title as assignee the defendants put in issue the fact, implied in the averment that the plaintiff was assignee in insolvency, that Fairbanks was a trader within the meaning of the Insolvency Act of 1869[11]. This issue the plaintiff failed to prove. The only evidence of trading was that of the plaintiff himself, and was very brief and meagre; he says:\nFairbanks bought and sold all sorts of things. I had dealings with him. He bought oats and wood and iron. No debts or assets of that kind. The insolvent business has relation solely to land. He handed me no books of business nor cash book. His books had reference only to the canal property; other lands of his had been wound up. I gave no bond for his estate; it was not required. The assignment was a voluntary one, but it was in the form prescribed by the Act, and could have no operation to pass the legal estate in the lands in question unless the Act applied. By the 1st section of the Insolvency Act of 1869 it is enacted that it shall apply to traders only. It contains, however, no definition of a trader. The authorities on the Bankruptcy Acts and the description of traders contained in the English Bankruptcy Statutes of 1849 and 1869 show conclusively that the evidence in the present case was entirely insufficient to establish trading so as to bring the insolvent within the operation of the Act. Mr. Robson in his treatise on bankruptcy lays it down that buying and selling and dealing in land are insufficient to constitute a person a trader[12]. Again the same writer[13] says:\nIn order to constitute a trading by buying and selling, or by buying and letting for hire, or the workmanship of goods and commodities, these occupations must be followed as a means of gaining a livelihood; one or two isolated transactions willnot do * * * Buying without selling, or letting for hire, at least without an intention to sell or to let for hire, or vice vers\u00e2, will not constitute a trading * * * So, also, the buying and selling ought to be in the general way of business and not in a qualified manner, or only for a special purpose.\nThe evidence does not establish that Fairbanks bought or sold in the course of any trade or business, or that he carried on any business, or got his livelihood by buying and selling in the way mentioned; it is consistent with the plaintiff's testimony that what he refers to were mere isolated transactions and not in the course of any general dealing. It is therefore insufficient to prove the affirmative of the issue which was on the plaintiff\u2014that Fairkanks was subject to the operation of the Insolvency Act of 1869. The consequence is that the plaintiff has no title to sue, and a verdict should have been found at the trial for the defendants.\nAt the trial leave was reserved to move to enter a verdict for the defendants, at least such is the construction which I place on the note of the learned Chief Justice, which is as follows:\nThe evidence being closed, both counsel decline addressing the judge, and it is agreed that a verdict shall be entered for the plaintiff with $10 damages, subject to the opinion of the court, that the parties shall be entitled to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and that the court shall have power to enter judgment for or against the defendants * * * A rule nisi for a new trial to be granted accordingly and filed.\nI read the words \"enter judgment\" in this minute as synonymous with \"enter a verdict,\" for in no other way would they have any sense or meaning.\nThen the rule nisi granted was, it is true, a rule nisi for a new trial, but it refers to this leave to move, and was granted in pursuance of it. I see, therefore, no reason why the court should not have made it absolute to enter a verdict, which was, no doubt, what was intended instead of judgment for the defendants, as is directed by the rule in its present form. The rule being, therefore, varied in the way I have indicated, will effect such a disposition of the case as the court and the parties contemplated by their consent at the trial, in the event which has occurred, of the court in banc being of opinion that the plaintiff failed to prove his case. The rule absolute should, therefore, be altered by substituting the word \"verdict\" for \"judgment,\" and, subject to that variation, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nHaving ascertained that a majority of the court had decided to disallow the appeal in this case and to grant a new trial, solely on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence that the appellant was the assignee of Fairbanks, in which character he brought the action, without considering the merits of the action, I concluded it would serve no good purpose for me to do so, differing from them, as I do, on the point upon which their decision rests.\nBy the Practice Act in Nova Scotia the representative character of the assignee of a bankrupt is not in issue, unless specially pleaded, and sec. 144 of the Insolvent Act of 1875 provides that \"deeds of assignment shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence in all courts, whether civil or criminal,\" of the appointment of the assignee, \"and of the regularity of all proceedings at the time thereof and antecedent thereto.\" The assignment in this case furnished that prim\u00e2 facie evidence. The words of the section \"shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his appointment\" to be of any service, must mean his regular and legal appointment to the same extent as the statutory provision, that letters of administration or probate of a will would be prim\u00e2 facie evidence, except, perhaps, in suits as to land, of the death of the intestate or testator, and that the party died in the place over which the judge of probate had jurisdiction. To make the provision of any real value by the power of the words I have quoted they must be construed to go to the length I have stated. The object was clearly to prevent the necessity of proving that the assignment was legally made in every case where a suit should be tried in respect of any asset of the estate, real or personal.\nIn the fifteenth and last plea of the respondent that character was denied. The onus of proof was therefore put upon plaintiff. I think there is sufficient evidence furnished by the assignment that Fairbanks was a trader. The assignment by him would be sufficient, I think, to vest in the appellant a right to property, so that he could maintain an action against a wrong doer. It was made to the appellant as interim assignee, and he was subsequently appointed assignee by the creditors of the estate. The assignment is in the form prescribed by the statute, 38 Vic., ch. 16, under which it was made; and it vested in the assignee by virtue of the 15th sec. \"all the right, power, title and interest,\" which the insolvent had in and to any real or personal property. It is said, however, that if he were not a trader within the terms of the statutes the assignment passed nothing. The uncertainty and generality of the assignment, as to the property intended to be conveyed, if in an ordinary deed, would, no doubt, render it void, but here we have a statutory provision supplying that defect and removing that objection\u2014for that is certain which can be made certain. As between the insolvent and his assignee, the voluntary assignment is a binding transfer. The former, in the case of a sale of the property by the latter, would be estopped from saying he had not conveyed the title to his assignee. It was in my mind a sufficient transfer to have enabled the assignee to have recovered in an action the property from the bankrupt himself, and the latter would not be permitted to plead that at the time of the assignment he was not a trader. If he were not such, and that therefore the assignment was voidable, as I hold it only to have been, as respects creditors, one who did not adopt it, or a debtor of the insolvent whose debt was assigned, might challenge the legality of the assignment, but I don't think outside parties should be permitted to do so in the way contended for in this case. The creditors, at the meeting before mentioned, adopted the assignment by unanimously appointing the appellant assignee, and those who did so would be estopped from saying that he was not such assignee. The assignment was registered in the Insolvent Court and adopted, and all parties interested acknowledge it as correct and valid. Is it then for outside parties to impeach it in the way attempted here?\nThere is still another objection. The plea in question raises an issue which I think does not touch the question as to whether the insolvent was a trader or not. The words are \"that the said Wm. H. Creighton was not nor is such assignee as alleged,\" Notwithstanding the authorities cited in the court below, I am of opinion that the plea is but a denial of the fact that he was de facto such assignee. It does not allege that Fairbanks was not a trader within the terms of the Insolvency Acts, and therefore that the assignment was void as being unauthorized. They are two separate and distinct issues requiring altogether different evidence to be adduced by the respondent It is one thing to deny the mere making of the instrument and another to allege circumstances that make it void or voidable as the case may be. In the one case the burden of proving the fact of the making of the instrument is thrown upon the party producing it, and although the affirmative of the issue in the other case is on the same party the proof is essentially different. By merely denying the making of the assignment the respondent cannot, therefore, by any rule of evidence that I know, be permitted to throw the onus of proof on the other party, of proving that which is not denied. That doctrine is applicable to the plea in this case. The appellant should have been notified that it was intended to question the right of Fairbanks to make the assignment. The plea gives no such intimation, and that is the test applied by the rules of pleading. It should, in my opinion, have done so, and without that statement I think the issue raised was only as to the execution of the assignment.\nIf, however, the issue in question was raised by the plea the evidence in respect of it was all on one side, that of the appellant; he was examined as a witness and amongst other things said that he was the official assignee of the estate and produced the assignment which was put in evidence. He said further:\u2014\nFairbanks bought and sold all sorts of things. I had dealings with him. He bought oats and wood and iron. No debts or assets of that kind. The insolvent business has relation solely to land. He handed me no books of business nor cash books. His books had reference only to the Canal property; other lands of his had been wound up.\nThis evidence was given in reply to questions of the respondent's counsel and is all that was given by the witness or any other on that subject. Here then is a comprehensive statement that the bankrupt \"bought and sold all sorts of things,\" and, no doubt in answer to a further request to name some of the articles he traded with, he replied he bought oats and wood and iron,\" meaning clearly that the witness knew of his trading in those articles. It appears to me that is sufficient prim\u00e2 facie evidence of trading of which the respondent's counsel by not going into a more critical examination would leave the impression that he felt satisfied; or, that further inquiries would lead to the fact being more fully and completely established. Suppose that evidence had formed part of the examination in chief, and that no cross-questions were asked as to it, how could it be said to be insufficient?\nIs it the less strong because it was given on the cross-examination of the witness?\nIt was contended that because the evidence was brought out in that way, the appellant should have given additional and more specific evidence, but I cannot adopt that proposition and know of no rule of evidence requiring it. The evidence was such that no judge would be justified in withdrawing it from the consideration of a jury, particularly when there was nothing in rebuttal of it; and I cannot feel justified in sending back the case upon such a point and one which leaves the merits untouched. It has been said that, because the insolvent had no assets, nor owed any debts in immediate relation to his trading, nor handed over any books relating thereto to the assignee, he could not have been a trader; but if while a trader he contracted debts not immediately connected with his trading\u2014such as for the support of his family, or as security for another\u2014that he had real and personal estate while he was such trader, but not the immediate result of his trading, the fact of his having neither assets nor owing debts connected with his trading, would not make him the less a trader, nor would the fact that he handed over no books of account of his trading transactions necessarily disqualify him to make an assignment to creditors for other debts contracted while he was a trader, merely because his trading operations, technically speaking, had been closed.\nSection 1 of the act awards the benefit of it amongst others to \"persons using the trade of merchandise by way of bargaining, exchange, bartering, commission, consignment or otherwise in gross or by retail.\" The section excepts from the operation of the act farmers, graziers, common laborers and workmen for hire, so that the operation of the act extended to all other classes and all were deemed traders who came within the provisions of the section.\nI wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not hold that the evidence as to the bankrupt having been a trader was at all conclusive, or that it might not have been shewn under proper pleas that the debts he owed were incurred after he ceased to be a trader or were barred by the statute of limitations, but it was not alleged or shown that he ceased to be a trader before his assignment, nor that his debts were barred by the statute of limitations. I do not contend that such would not have been a good defence, but what I do hold is that, under the issue raised by the plea in question, the appellant was not bound to prove them, nor was he, I think, any more bound to prove further than he did that he was a trader.\nThe rule nisi in this case was for a new trial but the court appealed to gave a judgment for the defendant. I understand that at least a majority of this court feel that the judgment cannot be sustained and I am of that opinion. The court in Nova Scotia has no power to give a judgment in such a case. Our judgment should therefore be to set it aside with costs.\nI think on all the grounds I have stated that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment below reversed, and judgment given for the appellant with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis is an action of trespass qu. cl. ft. wherein the plaintiff, as assignee of the estate and effects of Lewis P. Fairbanks, under the Insolvent Act of 1875, complains in his first count that the defendants broke and entered certain lands and close of the plaintiff, as such assignee, situate at Dartmouth, in the County of Halifax, described as follows, that is to say: \"Certain land, and land covered with water, known as section number 2, of the Shubenacadie Canal, and forming the reservoir thereof and called \"the first and second Dartmouth Lakes,\" &c.; and in his second count, that the defendants entered upon certain lands and lands covered with water of the plaintiff, as such assignee, situate at Dartmouth aforesaid, and described as in the said first count, and deposited thereon large quantities of stone, earth and rubbish, and made an embankment thereon, and erected buildings and fences thereon, and dug the soil thereof, and drove posts and stakes therein, and cut and carried away the ice formed on the said land covered with water and converted the same to their own use.\nAnd in his third count the plaintiff complained that the defendants took and carried away and converted to their own use and deprived the plaintiff, as such assignee, of the use and possession of large quantities of ice, to wit: five thousand tons of ice, the property of the plaintiff, as such assignee.\nThere were also three other counts in the declaration, in the fourth of which the plaintiff complained of an entry by the defendants on the close and lands described in the first count, calling them the close and lands of Lewis P. Fairbanks. In the fifth count the plaintiff complained that the defendants broke and entered the close and lands described in the first count, but calling them the close and lands of Lewis P. Fairbanks, and committed therein similar trespasses to those set out in the second count. The sixth count was similar to the third, except that the ice was alleged to be the property of Lewis P. Fairbanks and of the plaintiff.\nThe defendant pleaded to the first and second counts as follows:\u2014 1st. Not guilty.\n2nd. That the closes, land, and land covered with water and ice, was not the plaintiff's, as alleged, nor was he in possession thereof.\n3rd. That the said closes, land and land covered with water are the freehold of the defendants.\n4th. Liberum tenementum in the defendant Johnston Chittick, and others, and that he in his own right and the other defendants, as his servants and by his command, committed the said alleged grievances.\n5th. Liberum tenementum in one George A. S. Creighton, and that the defendants, as his servants and by his command, committed the said alleged grievances.\n6th. As to the 3rd count\u2014not guilty.\n7th. As to the 3rd count, that the ice therein mentioned was not the property of the plaintiff as such assignee as therein alleged.\nThere were precisely similar pleas to the 4th and 5th counts, and the defendants lastly and 15thly pleaded:\nThat the plaintiff was not, nor is, such assignee as alleged in his declaration.\nAt the trial before the late Chief Justice of Nova Scotia sitting as a jury at Halifax, the plaintiff produced in evidence divers documents and deeds, by force of which, and of divers acts of parliament, he contended that a certain canal or water communication called the Shubenacadie canal, undertaking, works and property, became vested in a certain corporation known as \"The Lake and River Navigation Company.\" He also produced a deed bearing date the 1st April, 1870, purporting to be between \"the Lake and Navigation Company,\" of the one part, and Lewis P. Fairbanks of the other part, whereby it was witnessed that the said company did grant, &c., &c., &c., unto the said Lewis P. Fairbanks, his heirs, and assigns, all the lands, lands covered with water, messuages, locks and other works, water-powers and appurtenances described in a deed from the Hon. James McNab to the 'Inland Navigation Company', reserving out of said lands a sufficient quantity of land for roads throughout the same, for the use of Her Majesty's subjects, saving and excepting nevertheless, from the said lands, the premises conveyed to James Marshall, and also other estate and interest which the said company have in, or to the said land and premises with the appurtenances; to have and to hold the said lands and premises conveyed, or intended so to be, with the appurtenances, unto the said Lewis P. Fairbanks his heirs and assigns forever, &c. This deed purports to be signed by James F. Avery, president, and G. A. S. Crichton, secretary. The plaintiff also produced a deed of assignment, purporting to be made on the 31st day of May, 1876, under the insolvent act of 1875, between Lewis P. Fairbanks, described therein as trader of Dartmouth in the county of Halifax of the first part, and William H. Creighton, official assignee of the county of Halifax, of the second part, whereby it was witnessed:\nThat under the provisions of the insolvent act of 1875, the said party of the first part being insolvent has assigned and hereby does assign to the said party of the second part, accepting thereof as assignee under the said act, and for the purposes therein provided, all his estate and effects real and personal of every nature and kind whatsoever, to have and to hold to the party of the second part as assignee for the purposes, and under the act, aforesaid.\nAt the trial it was contended that the Lewis P. Fairbanks executing this assignment was not proved to be a trader, and competent as such to make such an assignment under the Insolvent Act. The only evidence of this point was that of the plaintiff himself, who said:\nFairbanks bought and sold all sorts of things. I had dealings witty him. He bought oats and wood and iron. No debt or assets of that kind. The insolvent business has relation solely to land. He handed me no books of business nor cash book. His books had only reference to the canal property; other lands of his had been wound up. Lewis P. Fairbanks having been himself subsequently called gave no evidence of his being a trader. In his evidence he said:\nI did not know I owned the shore of the lake till five years ago. [The trial was in 1878.] The property is not used for canal purposes now, some small parts of what is necessary for canal purposes have gone out of me. The first section is entirely gone, the second section, including the lake, remains to me. I sold the machinery.\nCounsel for the defendants moved a non-suit at the close of plaintiff's case, but nevertheless a vast deal of evidence was entered into upon the part of the defendants, partly with the view of insisting that the description in certain deeds which were produced on the plaintiff's part did not cover the places where the plaintiff stated the alleged trespasses or some of them to have been committed, and partly to shew title in the defendants under their pleas of liberum tenementum, and to shew possession in them, or those under whom they claimed, of part of the premises at the time of the execution of some of the deeds under which the plaintiff claimed the title to be in Fairbanks. At the close of the evidence, counsel for both parties, instead of addressing the learned Chief Justice, who tried the cause upon the evidence as a jury, declined doing so, and entered into an agreement which was recorded by the learned Chief Justice, as follows:\nThat a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff with $10 damages, subject to the opinion of the court, that the parties shall be entitled to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and that the court shall have power to enter judgment for or against the defendants with costs, each party to prepare brief abstracts instead of copies of the documents put in by him, the originals to be produced, if required by the court, a rule nisi for a new trial to be granted accordingly and filed.\nIn the following term of the Supreme Court sitting in Halifax, on motion of Mr. Weatherby, Q.C., defendants' counsel, a rule nisi was issued in the following terms:\u2014 On reading the minutes of the learned judge who tried this cause, and the papers on file herein, and on motion, it is ordered that the verdict entered herein formally by consent, subject to the opinion of the court, with power to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and with power to the court to enter judgment for or against defendants with costs, be set aside with costs, and a new trial granted herein on the following grounds:\u2014Because the said verdict is against law and evidence. For the improper rejection and reception of evidence, and on other grounds appearing in said evidence, minutes and papers, unless cause to the contrary be shown before this honorable court within the first four days of the ensuing December term at Halifax.\nAfter argument of this rule, and upon the 11th January, 1881, a rule absolute entitled in the cause was issued in the following terms; namely,\nOn argument of the rule nisi to set aside the verdict herein for the plaintiff and on motion. It is ordered that said rule nisi be made absolute with costs, and judgment entered herein for defendants against the plaintiff, with costs.\nAgainst this rule the plaintiff appealed, and the case was argued fully upon its merits during three days on the 25th, 26th and 27th October, 1881, by Mr. Thompson, Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, for the plaintiff (appellant), and by Mr. Rigby, Q.C., for the defendants (respondents).\nThe plaintiff claims title to the closes, lands and lands covered with water in the first count of the declaration described as being \"section number 2 of the Shubenacadie Canal, forming the reservoir thereof, and called the first and second Dartmouth Lakes,\" and which are declared to be in the second count the same lands, &c., as are in first count mentioned, and which by the evidence taken in the cause appear to be the same lands, &c., &c., &c., from which the ice mentioned in the third count is alleged to have been taken, solely as assignee of the estate and effects of Lewis P. Fairbanks, under the Insolvent Act of 1875. The fourth, fifth and sixth counts seem to have been inserted by error, as claiming the lands to be the property of Fairbanks, the alleged insolvent, and not in the only person who is plaintiff upon the record, although no objection thereto seems to have been taken by the defendants, who have pleaded thereto similar pleas to those respectively pleaded to the first three counts; but on this record no judgment could be rendered upon the fourth, fifth and sixth counts, nor otherwise than upon the issues joined on the first, second and third counts, in which the plaintiff asserts title solely as assignee, under the Insolvent Act, of the estate and effects of Lewis P. Fairbanks, and it was upon these issues only that the argument upon the whole merits of the appeal before us took place. The court below, acting upon the agreement entered into at nisi prius, set aside the verdict which had been entered pro form\u00e2 for the plaintiff; upon the ground that Lewis P. Fairbanks was not, or was not shown to be, a trader, so as to enable him to assign to the plaintiff, or the plaintiff to take his estate and effects under the Insolvent Act, and to vest such estate and effects in the plaintiff, as the official assignee for the county of Halifax. It was argued before us on the part of the plaintiff that the pleadings did not raise any issue upon that point, but I was of opinion at the argument, and still am, that the plea, that the plaintiff was not nor is such assignee as alleged in the declaration, does put the trading in issue and casts the onus of the proof thereof upon the plaintiff, and indeed in an action of this nature, the plaintiff not appearing to have been in possession of any of the closes in which, &c., and being therefore, in order to sustain this action, compelled to show a good title, the onus is cast upon him of proving everything necessary to the vesting of the estate of Lewis P. Fairbanks in the plaintiff, as his assignee under the Insolvent Act, as well as to show that the property in question had been, before the Insolvent Act operated upon it, the property of Lewis P. Fairbanks, the alleged insolvent. After the long argument before us upon the whole case, which extended over three days, during which the learned counsel for the plaintiff strenuously insisted that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment upon all the points, I do not think it desirable that we should dispose of the case solely upon the point as to the trading.\nIf the question of the trading was the only one which stood in the way of the plaintiff's right to recover, the better course would no doubt be to send the case to a new trial, if the plaintiff wishes to have an opportunity to supply further evidence upon that point, but if, assuming the trading to be established, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon the other points, as to which it is not suggested that any further evidence can be given, I cannot see, after the very full discussion which these points have undergone, what possible object there can be in our protracting an expensive litigation by withholding our opinion upon points so exhaustively argued during three days. If the case was to be decided upon the point of trading alone, I do not think we should have thought it necessary to reserve our judgment upon that point, or to have heard the argument upon the other points, but having heard the whole case very exhaustively argued upon a judgment rendered upon an agreement entered into by the parties at nisi prius, whereby it was stipulated that the court should be at liberty upon the whole case to render judgment for or against the defendants, I think that in the absence of any suggestion that upon a new trial further evidence could be supplied by the plaintiff, we are called upon to express an opinion upon the whole case, and if the plaintiff, assuming the trading to be established, is nevertheless upon the other and main grounds not entitled to recover, to terminate the continuance of an expensive and fruitless litigation.\nUpon the close of the evidence at the trial, which took place before the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court without a jury, the counsel for both parties entered into an agreement whereby it was agreed \"that a verdict should be entered pro form\u00e2 for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court in term, and that the parties should be entitled to take all objections arising out of the evidence and minutes, and that the court should have power to enter judgment for or against the defendants, with costs.\"\nNothing is said in this agreement to the effect that the court above should have power to draw inferences of fact as a jury could, which words do appear to have been introduced into an agreement made at nisi prius in a case of ejectment tried at the same time upon the same title at the suit of the plaintiff against one Graham, whereby it was agreed that the agreement in the suit v. Chittick et al., with a verdict for the plaintiff, should extend to the ejectment suit with power for the court to draw the same inference from the facts in proof as the judge on trial or a jury could do. Whether such a provision is necessary in the case of a trial before a judge without a jury seems to me to be questionable, and, indeed, the provision that upon the evidence taken at the trial the court above should have power to enter a verdict for or against defendants without any actual finding of facts by the learned judge who tried the case without a jury, seems to imply the necessity for an adjudication and finding of matters of fact by the court from the evidence so laid before them. The court also seems to have been of opinion that it was competent for them upon the agreement in the trespass case, equally as in the ejectment case, to discharge the functions of a jury and to draw inferences of fact, for that they did in fact in this trespass case exercise that jurisdiction, appears from the judgment of the court setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff, wherein it is said:\nThe objection that he, Fairbanks, was not shown to be a trader was taken at the trial and in the argument, and at the former the plaintiff should, if he could, have given evidence, to justify us in holding that he was such, but that was not done, unless we are to regard the assignment alone as evidence.\nAnd upon this point it is said:\nBut admitting that the assignment is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the insolvent being a trader, how can we uphold the presumption in the face of the evidence given by the plaintiff himself showing clearly that Mr. Fairbanks was not a trader.\nSo that from this it appears the Court proceeded, not upon the absence of all evidence to go to a jury upon the question, but construing evidence offered as a jury, they have found that in point of fact Fairbanks was not a trader, thus plainly discharging the functions of a jury, and accordingly they set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendants against the plaintiff with costs.\nThis rule is not printed in the appeal case, as it should have been, but having been called for by us during the argument it has been supplied, and appears to be to the above effect.\nNow to order a verdict to be entered for the defendants upon this record, even though it should be amended by striking out the 4th, 5th and 6th counts, and the pleas thereto, on the ground of misjoinder, would give to the defendants judgment upon the pleas of liberum tenementum to the first two counts, which it cannot be said that they have clearly established by evidence, and which judgment when entered would operate as an estoppel in the defendants favor as against Fairbanks, in whose right the plaintiff claims. Judgment therefore upon the issue proved upon the pleas of liberum tenementum should be for the plaintiff unless that plea be removed from the record. But if we amend the record by expunging the 4th, 5th and 6th counts, and the pleadings relating thereto, and by expunging also the pleas of liberum tenementum pleaded to the 1st and 2nd counts, I think that for the reasons hereinafter stated the defendants are entitled to judgment in their favor upon the 1st, 2nd and 3rd counts, to which counts the argument before us was confined. As to those counts upon the record being so amended, I can see no object in protracting this litigation by ordering a new trial, as the defendants are, in my judgment, entitled to succeed, even though it should be established that Fairbanks was a trader, so as to be within the operation of the Insolvent Act.\nAs to the close upon the margin of the second lake, the plaintiff's first step in his claim of title to it, is to shew that the canal company acquired the fee simple therein under the 13th section of their act of incorporation. He accordingly produced a petition of the company to the justices in quarter sessions, a precept to the sheriff thereon, and an inquisition taken by the sheriff with a jury in 1826, but no map was produced shewing the lands intended to be covered by the description set out in the inquisition of the lands therein referred to, and if we had such a map, and if it plainly comprised the close in question, there is no evidence that the verdict rendered upon the inquisition has been allowed and confirmed by the quarter sessions as required; and it is not contended that payment was made to any one of the amount assessed, nor, indeed, does the inquisition determine the amount, but leaves it to be ascertained by a measurement to be made after the close should be flooded by the works of the company. Under these circumstances, and as the act of incorporation of the company makes the confirmation of the inquisition when taken and the payment to the proprietors of the amount assessed for their lands taken conditions precedent to the vesting of the fee in such lands in the company, it is clear that the plaintiff has not shown that the close in question ever became vested in the canal company. By flooding the close, by the waters of the lake being raised by the works of the company, the latter may have acquired a prescriptive right to keep the close so flooded, but they have not acquired the fee in the close, so that as to this close the plaintiff for that reason alone must fail in this action.\nAs to the rest of the alleged trespasses which were said to have been committed by the taking of ice from places in the first lake, the act of incorporation of 1824 did not vest or profess to vest in the company the soil and bed of the lakes; it vested in them only, so far as the lakes are affected, \"the waters and streams of the said river and lakes, so far as the same might be required or necessary to be used, retained, diverted or appropriated to and for the use and benefit of the canal and the beneficial enjoyment thereof,\" and also all real estate purchased or obtained for such canal and through which it shall be made, with the towing paths along the canal, river and lakes, for the term of 99 years.\nThis is the provision contained in the eighth section of the Act of 1824, and it left untouched the title in the bed and soil of the lakes, whether that title was then in the Crown or in some private person or persons.\nThe Act of 8th Geo. 4, c. 17, A.D. 1827, made no difference in this respect, for all that act did was to declare that all and singular those things which by the eighth section of the Act of 1824 had been granted to the company for 99 years should be and were vested in and declared to be the sole and exclusive property of the company forever; and as the eighth section of the Act of 1821 did not affect the soil and bed of the lakes, so neither did the Act of 1827. The company therefore had no title in virtue of the acts of Parliament, to the soil and bed of the lake at the places where the defendants took the ice, for the taking of which this action is brought. But the plaintiff alleges that the canal company became seized of a large portion of the soil and bed of the first lake, comprising those portions from which the ice was taken by the defendants, under and in virtue of a deed dated the 12th April, 1831, and made between Richard and James Tremain of the one part, and the Shubenacadie Canal Company of the other part, whereby after reciting that under and by virtue of an indenture dated the 13th October, 1815, between one Laurence Hartshorne, since deceased, of the one part, and the above-named Richard Tremain of the other part, and by virtue of another indenture dated the 14th June, 1816, and made between one Jonathan Tremain, of the one part, and the above-named James Tremain of the other part; and by virtue of another indenture dated the 25th October, 1828, and made between Abigail Hartshorne, widow and executrix, and Laurence Hartshorne, surviving executor of the late will of the above named Laurence Hartshorne, deceased, of the one part, and the said James Tremain of the other part; and by virtue of another indenture, dated the 1st September, 1830, and made between Ph\u00e6be Tremain, executrix, and Thomas Boggs and George Norton Russell, executors of the will of the said Jonathan Tremain, deceased, of the one part, and the said Richard and James Tremain of the other part, they, the said Richard and James Tremain, then stood seized of\nall that flour mill and bakehouse or bakery, and all those lands partly covered with water, and tenements, situate lying and being in Dartmouth aforesaid, and hereinafter firstly and secondly described, and also of and in the mill stream or water course and lands partly covered with water, hereinafter thirdly described, with the appurtenances in fee simple in possession; that is to say, as tenants in common, each of and in one equal and undivided moiety or half part of the said described premises, as by reference to the said four several indentures will at large appear,\nthey, the said Richard and James Tremain conveyed to the company, among other lands, a piece described as follows:\u2014\nSecondly: all that piece of land lying between the south end of Dartmouth lake, and the two roads leading, the one from Dartmouth to the west side of the said lake, and the other to Preston, and measuring from the angle formed by the said roads on the road towards Preston, north-eastwardly to a marked stone near a spruce tree marked; thence to run into the said lake north 35\u00b0 west to the north side line of the lot conveyed on the 20th February, 1815, by the executor of the will of James Creighton the elder, deceased, to the said Laurence Hartshorne, deceased; thence S. 55\u00b0 west to the stump of a hemlock tree formerly standing at the north end of the mill dam; thence N. 35\u00b0 W. to the side of the highway leading from Dartmouth; thence by the several courses of the said road to the place of beginning at the angle of the said roads. Thirdly: all that mill stream and watercourse and lands wholly or in part covered with water lying between the south end of Dartmouth lake at the mill dam from whence the said mill-stream and water-course flows to the Dartmouth cove aforesaid.\nNow, the plaintiff's contention is, that the piece of land described under the head \"Secondly,\" and above set out, extends along the easterly side of the Dartmouth lake, all of which he claims to come under the designation in the deed of \"the south end\" to a point distant nearly half a mile beyond the point at which the \"road towards Preston\" first reached the lake, and thence on a course N. 35\u00b0 W. 11 1\/2 chains into the lake to a point which, as he contends, is made by the deed of the 20th February, 1815, the north west angle of the piece of land therein described. Now, upon this point it is to be observed that, as the plaintiff does not attempt to trace title from Letters Patent from the crown, he must needs, in order to launch a case against the defendants upon this record, prove that at the time of the execution of the deed of the 12th April, 1831, by Richard and James Tremain, they were in the actual possession of the soil and bed of the lake, as it is described in the deed of the 20th February, 1815, and which the plaintiff now claims to have passed under the deed of April, 1831, of which actual possession there is no evidence, Moreover, from the recitals contained in the deeds of April, 1831, and of 25th October, 1828, therein recited, it is plain that all that was intended to be conveyed by those deeds was the flour mill and bakery, lands and mill stream, with the appurtenances thereto, in which Laurence Hartshorne, deceased, and Jonathan Tremain originally were interested as tenants in common, and in which Richard and James Tremain became in like manner interested by the deeds of the 13th October, 1815, and the 14th June, 1816, recited in the deed of April, 1831. Now, by the deed of October, 1815, Laurence Hartshorne, deceased, conveyed to Richard Tremain one undivided part of the property in question by the following description:\u2014\nOne full undivided half part of that certain lot or parcel of land lying between the two roads leading from the main road through Dartmouth to the lake, as purchased lately at auction at the sale of James Creighton's estate, together with one full undivided half part of all and singular the houses, mills, stores, barns, stables, buildings, ways, water watercourses, easements, &c., to the same belonging.\nIf the purchase \"lately at the auction at the sale of James Creighton's estate,\" here referred to, is that represented by the deed of 20th February, 1815, it is plain that the whole of the land described in that deed was not intended to be passed by the deed of October, 1815, but only so much as lay between the roads and the lake, which, as there is evidence to show that the road towards Preston\" touched the lake at a point south of what is called Glendenning ice house, on the plan G. G. would seem to indicate a piece of land somewhat in the shape of a triangle, of which the two roads formed the legs and the south end of the lake the base. In the deed of the 14th June, 1816, the description is the same.\nFrom the deed of April, 1831, and from the descriptions contained in the petition by the Company to the Quarter Sessions in 1826, from line 42 to line 68 it is plain that what was regarded and called the south end of the lake was that end of the lake lying between the \"road towards Preston, where, as the evidence shews, it touched the lake south of Glendenning ice house, in the plan G. G., and the opposite or westerly side, where the road from Dartmouth struck the west side of the lake, and that a line drawn from the former point of junction of the road with the lake, on a course N. 35\u00b0 W. to what is called the \"north side line,\" as described in the deed of 13th October, 1815, more properly the \"westerly side line\" would seem to accord with the description in the deeds of 12th April, 1831, the 13th October, 1815, and the 14th June, 1816; and the piece of land so described, in view of the limits described in the Company's petition to the quarter sessions in 1826, and in the mortgage to the Hon. Sampson Bowers and Sir Rupert D. George, and in the deed executed upon foreclosure of the mortgage to the treasurer of the province, Mr. McNab, and in other subsequent documents, as the northern boundary of section No. 1 of the canal, would seem to constitute the northern extremity of that section. The continuance of the \"road towards Preston,\" passed the point where it first touched the lake, and past Glendenning's ice house and along the lake shore to the point where the northerly boundary of the line described in the deed of 20th February, 1815, struck the Dartmouth lake running on a course N. 35\u00b0 W., would be a line running along the eastern side of the lake. I think, therefore, that it must be concluded that the plaintiff has failed to establish, and I confess that I think there will be very great difficulty in its ever being established, that the deed of April, 1831, conveyed to the company the bed and soil of the lake, as is contended by the plaintiff, and to establish which, beyond all reasonable doubt, the onus lies upon him. No argument in support of the plaintiff's contention can, as was contended there could, be adduced from the papers produced in the matter of the partition of the Hartshorne estate in the case of Inglis v. Hartshorne in 1852, for, as the road which ran along the eastern shore of the lake separated the lake from the lands divided, it may well be that the heirs of Hartshorne either never considered Hartshorne to have had title to the soil and bed of the lake, or that if he had, it was valueless, without drawing from the fact of its not having been divided in the partition suit the inference that the reason was the knowledge of its having been conveyed to the company by the deed of April, 1831, or to the Tremains, who executed that deed. Neither the Act of 1824, nor that of 1827, appears to have contemplated the company's borrowing money upon the security of a mortgage, or to have authorized the execution by the company of a mortgage upon the lands acquired by the company, and in and through which the canal should be constructed and necessary for the beneficial use and enjoyment thereof as a water communication. Their power seems to have been limited by these acts to constructing, maintaining, having and holding the canal, when constructed, for the public use and benefit, subject to the payment of tolls, or as is expressed in the fifth section of the act of 1824: \"To use and appropriate the waters of the said river, lakes and streams, and the channels and water courses thereof, to and for the benefit of, and for rendering effectual, navigable and useful the said intended canal.\" The mortgage to Mr. Blowers and Sir Rupert George was executed under the authority of and in pursuance of the power contained in an act of the Imperial parliament (11 Geo. 4th and 1st Wm. 4, ch. 34), whereby the lords commissioners of Her Majesty's treasury were authorized to advance and lend to the Shubenacadie Canal Company for the completion of their canal a sum not exceeding \u00a320,000, and that all sums so advanced should be secured by an assignment of the tolls and profits of the canal to such persons in such manner and under such conditions and regulations as the said commissioners of the treasury should order and direct.\nIn an act of the general assembly of Nova Scotia passed in the year 1837, for the purpose of increasing the capital stock of the company, and of enabling it to make various alterations in the line and direction of the canal and in its depth and width, and in the position, nature and dimensions of the works as originally designed, \"whereby the said canal would be rendered more suitable to the purposes for which a great inland water communication through the province with its capital is required and be made more conveniently navigable by steamboats and sea-going vessels, and of greater extent and magnitude than were first intended,\" it is recited among other things that the Imperial loan of \u00a320,000 stg. was made on the security of the canal and the tolls and profits thereof, pursuant to an act of the Imperial parliament, and that all the funds of the company, consisting of 1,962 shares in the capital stock of the company, \u00a315,000 grant of the general assembly of Nova Scotia and the above \u00a320,000 were exhausted, and that the works were still unfinished and had so remained since 1831 for want of funds, and that \"forasmuch as completing the said enterprise is deemed an object of great public utility and importance,\" it was deemed expedient to authorize the Company to increase its capital stock, and to grant to the corporation certain other and further powers for facilitating the enterprise and works of the company, and for more convenient management of its affairs. From these acts it is apparent that the canal authorized to be constructed was designed to be a great public work of vast commercial and provincial importance, and whether or not the mortgage to Mr. Blowers and Sir Rupert George, which was executed under and in pursuance of the above act of the Imperial parliament, which expressly declared that the security for the loan should be on the tolls and profits of the canal, could be foreclosed in such manner that the fee simple estate in the canal works and in the property necessary for the beneficial use and enjoyment of the canal could become vested in the mortgagees, or transferred to any person or persons and vested in him or them as a fee simple estate, freed and discharged from application to the purposes of a canal or water communication by any authority short of the authority of an act of parliament, it is not necessary now to enquire, because the canal and all the property of the canal company comprised in the mortgage, whatever may have been the effect of the mortgage and of its foreclosure, was subsequently by act of parliament vested in a company, incorporated under the name of the Inland Navigation Company, for the express purpose of acquiring the property of the Shubenacadie Canal Company, and of completing the work which the latter company had been authorized but failed to complete.\nWhat was the effect of this mortgage and of its foreclosure? Whether the foreclosure could and did vest in the mortgagees, or in any person, an estate in fee simple in the canal and its works and in the property necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of the canal, are questions which will have to be considered in the light of the provisions of the Acts of 1853 and 1859 relating to the Inland Navigation Company, by the 6th section of the former of which the company was empowered \"to use the channels and waters of such rivers, lakes and streams in every way necessary for constructing such inland water communication and for rendering and keeping the same at all times navigable and in operation;\" and by the eighth section of which it was enacted that \"the inland water communication and towing paths should at all convenient times after the construction thereof be kept open for the use of the public, their boats, vessels, goods, horses, and cattle, upon payment of a certain rate of toll money, to be regulated by the company and approved by the Governor in Council and revised every five years.\" And by the fifteenth that the legislature might at its option at any time after twenty years from the passing of the act take such inland water communication with all the works and appurtenances thereof and keep the same in operation for the benefit and under the control of the government upon paying to the company a sum equal to twenty years purchase of the annual profits divisible upon the subscribed and paid-up capital stock of the company, provided such average rate of profits shall not be less than eight per cent. It was by the act of 1859 alone that the company was authorized to borrow money upon mortgage of the company's property and works, and by that act it was enacted that every mortgage of the property and works of the company for securing payment of monies to be borrowed should be a good legal and valid charge and lien upon such property and works; and that the directors of the company should be, (and they were then first) \"at liberty to sell and dispose of all and any parts of the lands and property which they might deem not actually required for the due and convenient working of the canal.\nNow, whether the forclosure of a mortgage executed under this authority can be construed to vest the fee simple estate in the property of the company, which is necessary for the actual and beneficial use and enjoyment of the canal as a water communication, in the mortgagees, or in any person, as their private property freed and discharged from the appropriation of the property to the use intended by the acts incorporating the company authorized to construct it and required to keep it navigable and in operation, and so in effect to disfranchise the company\u2014to terminate its existence,\u2014or relieve it from its obligations, and to defeat the provisions of the Act of 1853, enabling the province to take the work for the public use, raises so grave a question that, as it is not absolutely necessary to decide it to entitle the defendants to judgment in this action, and as there appears to be a probability that it will arise in some other action to which other persons will be parties, I withhold the expression of my opinion upon it.\nThen again as to the Lake and River Navigation Company\u2014that company was not incorporated by any special Act of Parliament authorizing it to acquire the property and privileges of, and subjecting it to the obligations of, the Inland Navigation Company. It claims to have been incorporated under the general act, ch. 2 of the acts of 1862, to be found at p. 750 of the 3rd series of the revised statutes; that company in its declaration professes to have been formed under the name of the Lake and River Navigation Company under the provisions of the above act \"for the purpose of purchasing, holding and disposing of the property and works formerly belonging to the Inland Navigation Company.\" Now, whether a company so formed could acquire the canal and its works, and the property necessary for its beneficial use which the acts incorporating and affecting the Inland Navigation Company, had vested in that company and their successors for ever, to have and to hold subject to the obligation of being at all times kept open for the use of the public as a navigable water communication from Halifax harbor to the bay of mines? whether Messrs. Gray and Stairs ever acquired any estate in the canal, its works and property necessary for its use? whether any deed purporting to convey that property to any one executed by them could have such operation? whether such property could be conveyed or pass from the Inland Navigation Company to any other company or individual by any mode of conveyance other than an act of parliament passed for the special purpose? whether the Inland Navigation Company is not still an existing corporation having vested in it the canal, its works and the property necessary for its beneficial use, subject to the obligation of its being kept open for public use? whither, if the Lake and River Navigation Company could, and did, ever acquire any estate in the canal, its works and the property necessary for the beneficial use of the canal, they acquired such property otherwise than as a canal company, as their name indicates, and on any other condition than subject to the obligation of keeping the canal open, and subject to the provisions and obligations to which the property was subjected as a water communication, by the acts affecting the Inland Navigation Company? and whether, in view of the terms of the Act of 1859, authorizing the Canal Company to sell only \"such lands as should not be required or necessary for the due and convenient working of the canal,\" the company could sell the canal itself, its works and the property actually necessary for the use of the canal, freed and discharged from, or even subject to, the obligation of being used as, and appropriated to, the purpose of a navigable canal or water communication, maintained and kept open for public use? these are grave questions upon which, for a like reason, I withhold the expression of my opinion. Independently of these questions, even though the plaintiff should be able to supply sufficient evidence upon the point of trading, I think that upon the record being amended as suggested, the defendants are entitled to judgment in their favor, and in my opinion the form of our order should be to the effect\u2014that the 4th, 5th and 6th counts of the declaration, together with the pleadings relating thereto and the pleas of liberum tenementum pleaded to the 1st and 2nd counts be struck off the record, and that then the rule for judgment in favor of the defendants made by the court below shall be upheld as applied to such amended record, and that judgment be entered thereon and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, the rule varied and made absolute for a new trial.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

Upper.\u201d\nAppeal and cross appeal from the Maritime Court of Ontario\u2014Collision with anchor of a vessel\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Damages, apportionment of.\nOn the 27th April, 1880, at Port K. on Lake Erie, where vessels go to load timber, staves, &c., and where the Erie Belle, the respondent\u2019s vessel, was in the habit of landing and taking passengers, the M.C. Upper, the appellant\u2019s vessel, was moored at the west side of the dock, and had her anchor dropped some distance out in continuation of the direct line of the east end of the wharf, thus bringing her cable directly across the end of the wharf from east to west, and without buoying the same or taking some measure to inform in-coming vessels where it was. The Erie Belle came into the wharf safely, and in backing out from the wharf she came in contact with the anchor of the M.C. Upper, making a large hole in her bottom.\nOn a petition filed by the owner of the Erie Belle, in the Maritime Court of Ontario to recover damages done to his vessel by the schooner M.C. Upper, the judge who tried the case found, on the evidence, that both vessels were to blame, and held that each should pay one half of the damage sustained by the Erie Belle. On appeal by owner of M.C. Upper and cross appeal by owner of Erie Belle to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, Per Ritchie, C.J., and Foumier and Taschereau, JJ., that as the Erie Belle, being managed with care and skill, went to the wharf in the usual way, and came out in the usual way, and as the M.C Upper had wrongfully and negligently placed her anchor (as much a part of the vessel as her masts) where it ought not to have been, and without indicating, by a buoy or otherwise, its position to the Erie Belle, the owner of the Erie Belle was entitled to full compensation, and the M.C. Upper should pay the whole of the damage.\nPer Strong, Henry and Gwynne, JJ., that the M.C. Upper had a right to have her anchor where it was, and that it was not in the line by which the Erie Belle entered and by which she could have backed out; that the strain on the anchor chain when the crew of the M.C. Upper were hauling on it all the time the Erie Belle was at K. sufficiently indicated the position of the anchor, and therefore that the accident happened through no fault or negligence on the part of the M.C. Upper.\nThe court being equally divided, the appeal and cross appeal were dismissed without costs, and the judgment of the Maritime Court of Ontario affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Maritime Court of Ontario.\nThis was a petition filed by the respondent, the owner of the steamer Erie Belle, to recover damages for injury done to his vessel by the schooner M.C. Upper, of which the appellant is owner.\nThe case made by the petition, as amended, was that on the 27th April, 1880, the defendant\u2019s schooner, the M.C. Upper, was moored at the dock at Kingsville, and had her anchor dropped, at a distance of about 250 feet from the dock, in the channel by which vessels usually depart from said port; that there was no buoy or other signal to indicate the position of the anchor; that about one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of that day, the Plaintiff\u2019s steamer, the Erie Belle, in her usual course, called at Kingsville, and shortly after, in backing out, struck the anchor of the M.C. Upper, being unaware of its being there, making a hole in her own hull, and in order to avoid sinking, ran ashore on Lake Erie; and that the disaster was imputable solely to the fault of the M.C. Upper in not buoying her anchor.\nThe plaintiff further alleged that \u201cit is the custom and usage at the said port, for all vessels having an anchor out to mark its position by a buoy or signal.\u201d\nThe defendant\u2019s contention was that the anchor lay where the direction of the chain indicated; that Kingsville was merely a wharf on the open coast, and that there was no channel leading to it, and plenty of sea-room for the plaintiff\u2019s vessel; that the persons in charge of the Erie Belle were well aware of the position of the anchor, and that the accident was due solely to the careless and unskilful manner in which the Erie Belle was managed, it being proved that the vessel was entrusted to another mariner, Captain Laframboise, who voluntarily offered to take the vessel in; that there was no obligation to buoy the auchor, and, in any case, that the absence of a buoy did not contribute to the disaster; that there was no impact between the vessels. The facts of the case appear in the following extract from the judgment of his honor G.W. Leggatt, Esq., surrogate judge of the Maritime Court of Ontario at Sandwich.\n\u201cI think it may be premised, for upon these points the evidence preponderates, if all the witnesses do not agree, that the port of Kingsville consists of a wharf projecting out in a southerly direction into the lake a distance of about 860 feet, where vessels go to load timber, staves, &c., and where the Erie Belle was in the habit of landing, when the weather permitted, on her route between Windsor and Leamington, with and for passengers and freight. That around the wharf, extending some distance east and west, there is a uniform sandy or hardpan bottom, interspersed with stones or boulders of greater or less size, the water gradually increasing in depth as the distance from the shore becomes greater, being nine or ten feet at the southerly end of the wharf and increasing to the depth of eleven feet, two hundred feet farther away into the lake in a westerly direction where the accident occurred. That it is customary for vessels in going to a wharf of this kind, exposed as it is on the open coast, for a cargo, to drop their anchor some distance away from the wharf, either to the east or west side thereof, as circumstances suggest or require; and that this mode of dropping the anchor a distance away, when making for the wharf, is taken as a proper precautionary measure to enable them to haul away from the wharf, in case the wind sets in from off the lake and they are required or forced to leave. That it is not usual to buoy the anchor in such a place as this: that the custom of buoying the anchor has gone out of vogue (though it did prevail at one time), in consequence of the liability of propellers to pick the buoys up with their wheels; that there is, as a rule, nothing to indicate to in-coming vessels or propellers where the anchor of a vessel is, except the known or recognized custom which prevails among vessels of casting their anchor as nearly in line with that of the side of the wharf at which they intend to land as they can get, so that the chain or cable would be, when heaved taut, in a direct line from the hawser hole to the place where the anchor would be, and parallel with or in continuation of the direct line of the east or west side of the wharf, just as the vessel may lie on the east or west side thereof. That knowing this practice, a steamer in making the wharf, seeing a schooner lying on the west side of the wharf, would get the range of the east side, some distance away, in order to avoid the possibility of coming in contact with the anchor, and thence proceed to the east or opposide side of the wharf to that upon which the schooner lies.\u201d\nAnd the learned judge at the trial came to the following conclusions:\n\u201cAfter making due allowance for the probable bias of the officers and crew of both the M.C. Upper and the Belle in giving their testimony in this cause, and giving the whole of the evidence the greatest possible consideration, I have come to the following conclusions: 1st. That the anchor of the Upper was dropped about 200 feet south of the wharf, and about in line with the centre of the wharf, extended in about 11 or 12 feet of water. 2nd. That the obstruction that the Belle came in contact with in backing out of the wharf, causing her to keel over the way she did, and making a large hole in her bottom, was the anchor of the Upper. 3rd. That the Belle in backing out did not retain the range of the east side of the wharf. Laframboise says \u201cthat she was heading about north when she struck.\u201d And Odette, the captain, says: \u201cWe backed out in range of the east side of the dock\u2014observed great care in backing out, and followed the usual course; we might have diverged 4 or 5 feet.\u201d If the boat was heading about north when she struck, she must have been farther west than they imagined. The wharf direction from the shore is somewhat east of south. 4th. It was misconduct, want of proper care and prudence on the part of the Upper in dropping her anchor where she did, in. water not more than 12 feet deep, without buoying the same, or taking some measure to inform in-coming vessels or steamers where it was.\n\u201cOn the other hand, I find that the Belle is chargeable with contributory negligence. 1st. In going into the wharf on that day, contrary to the better judgment of the captain or person in command, and when he knew it was dangerous, the water being low; 2nd. In the captain giving over the charge of his vessel for the time being, to an irresponsible person to take her into the wharf, when he would not do it himself; and 3rd. In not taking greater care to observe and maintain the same course in backing out from the wharf that they did in going in.\n\u201cThe Belle having failed to return immediately to the wharf she had just left, to ascertain the extent of the leak, before making for the river, exhibited a manifest want of skill and ordinary judgment, and thereby augmented and increased the expense of raising and repairing her.\n\u201cI assess the damage sustained by the plaintiff at $1,000.00; and, both vessels being in fault, do order and decree that the defendant do pay one moiety thereof to the plaintiff or petitioner, and that both parties be left to pay their own costs.\u201d\nA decree was drawn up accordingly, from which both parties immediately appealed. The plaintiff being the respondent on the main appeal, and the appellant on the cross appeal.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., for appellant and respondent on cross appeal, contended, upon the facts, that the M.C. Upper had not been guilty of contributory negligence, and that the rule respecting division of damage which obtains in the English High Court of Admiralty in cases of collision, was not applicable to this case, there being no impact between the parties\u2014no collision.\nMr. C. Robinson, Q.C., for respondent and appellant on cross-appeal, contended that the M.C. Upper was responsible for the total amount of damage sustained. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nI think there is sufficient evidence in the case to sustain the finding of the judge that the accident was occasioned by the Erie Belle coming in contact with the anchor of the M.C. Upper. That the Erie Belle had the right to come into the wharf to take on board the passengers; that she did go in successfully and was in charge of a competent and skilled mariner, and that he did navigate the vessel with care and skill; that such being the case, whether he was in the employ and pay of the owner, or took charge of the vessel voluntarily at the request or by consent of the captain in charge, so far as the liability of defendant is concerned, is matter of no consequence whatever. That the Erie Belle backed in range with the east side of the dock and out in the usual and customary course and. manner, and that had the anchor of the M.C. Upper been, as it should have been, in a direct line from the hawser hole in continuation of the direct line of the west side of the wharf, or if not in such direct line the anchor had been buoyed, the collision would not have taken place. That the anchor was dropped too far to the eastward.\nThat there is evidence that not only with a view to the convenience of the vessel herself, but having a due regard to the safety of other vessels coming in and leaving the pier, it is both prudent and right that anchors so dropped should be buoyed, and though the wholesome, sound and necessary rule of practice may have been abandoned, or not of late generally acted on, I am of opinion that those who choose for their own convenience not to adopt it, but to cast their anchors and leave them without a buoy or other indication of their actual position, do so at their own peril and risk, and if for want of such buoy or indication, vessels lawfully navigating the lake and in coming to or leaving the pier, using due, ordinary and reasonable skill and care, collide with such anchors, and damage is the result, it is a damage for which the parties so placing and leaving their anchors must be responsible. I cannot agree with the learned judge that the Erie Belle is chargeable with contributory negligence either in going into the wharf as she did, or in the captain having given over the charge of the vessel to a thoroughly skilled mariner, nor was there, in my opinion, any evidence of want of skill or care in backing out from the wharf.\nIf I could come to the conclusion at which the learned judge has arrived as to contributory negligence of the Belle or those in charge of her, I should think the blame rested on her, because if she ought not to have come to the wharf on that day, and doing so was improper, and by reason thereof the accident happened, or if her captain improperly gave up the command to an irresponsible person, and by reason thereof the accident happened, or if they did not take proper care in pursuing and maintaining the same course in backing out from the wharf that they did in going in, it is clear that the plaintiff cannot contend that the accident would not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care on his part. If he ought never to have gone into the wharf, and he wrongfully and negligently did so, it is clear that the accident never could have happened but for his wrongful and negligent conduct, and so, if the giving up the charge of the vessel was wrongful and negligent conduct, and the accident resulted therefrom, then equally was it occasioned by his wrongful act. So, if proper care was not taken in coming out, and the accident resulted therefrom, can it be said that in either or all of these cases the accident would not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care, in which case the plaintiff would not be liable. I cannot agree with the learned judge that both vessels were to blame. I think the blame rests with the M.C. Upper, and that the Belle is entitled to full compensation, and the M.C. Upper should pay the whole of the damage, estimated at $2,000, and costs. As then, I think the Belle went to the wharf in the usual way, and came out in the usual way, and had a right to assume that the M.C. Upper had placed no impediment in her way\u2014and could and would have done so in safety if the anchor of the M.C. Upper had been where it ought to have been, or had been buoyed, as it ought to have been, or had the parties in charge of the M.C. Upper notified or indicated its position to the Belle, as they ought to have done, I can discover no negligence or any want of the exercise of ordinary or proper care on the part of the Belle.\nThe law as to negligence has been settled perfectly well and beyond dispute, as was said by the Court of Exchequer in Radley v. The L. & N.W. Ry. Co.[1]:\nThe first proposition is a general one to this effect: that the plaintiff in an action of negligence cannot succeed, if it is found by the jury that he has been guilty of any negligence or want of ordinary care which contributed to cause the accident. But there is another proposition equally well established, and it is a qualification upon the first, namely: that though the plaintiff may have been guilty of negligence, and although that negligence may in fact have contributed to the accident, yet if the defendant could in the result by the exercise of ordinary care and negligence have avoided the accident which happened, the plaintiff\u2019s negligence will not excuse him.\nI think there is nothing whatever in the objection that there was \u201cno impact between the vessels.\u201d The hawser and anchor were as much a part of the M.C. Upper as her masts, sails or hull.\nTherefore, I think the appeal should be dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, but as the court are equally divided and the cross-appeal cannot be allowed, the appeal will stand dismissed but there can be no costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe learned judge before whom this case was heard in the Maritime Court found \u201cthat it is not usual to buoy the anchor in such a place as this; that the custom of buoying the anchor has gone out of vogue (though it did prevail at one time) in consequence of the liability of propellers to pick up the buoys with their wheels; that there is, as a rule, nothing to indicate to incoming vessels or propellers where the anchor of a vessel is, except the known or recognized custom which prevails among vessels of casting their anchor as nearly in a line with that side of the wharf at which they intend to land as they can get, so that the chain or cable would be, when hauled taut, in a direct line from the hawser hole to the place where the anchor would be, and parallel with, or in continuation of, the direct line of the east or west side of the wharf, just as the vessel may be on the east or west side thereof.\u201d This finding, it appears to me, at least so far as regards the abandonment of the procedure of buoying the anchor, was entirely justified by the evidence. It follows, therefore, that no negligence can be imputed to the vessel in the present instance for having omitted to affix a buoy to the anchor, that practice having been discontinued advisedly and for the purpose mentioned by the learned judge of avoiding the inconvenience caused by the buoys coming in contact with the wheels of propellers. That portion, therefore, of the judgment appealed from which determines that it was \u201cmisconduct and want of proper care and prudence on the part of the Upper\u201d to drop her anchor where she did without buoying it, is not only not warranted by the proof, but is in direct contradiction to the express find- ing of the learned judge himself as a fair and just inference from the evidence.\nThis leaves, then, the question of negligence to depend altogether on whether the anchor of the Upper was dropped too far to the east.\nThe learned judge having, as I think, properly found that the suggestion or theory that the cable had been fouled by coming in contact with the remains of the old sunken pier is not supported by the testimony, it is clear that the locality of the anchor must have been exactly indicated by the cable on which the crew of the Upper were hauling at the time of the collision. Then the captain of the Erie Belle and other witnesses for the propeller, who were on board her at the time of the collision, distinctly say that the direction of the Upper\u2019s chain indicated that the anchor was in a line with the centre of the dock, or to the west of that line, and the hypothesis of the sunken pier being destroyed, the evidence establishes beyond a doubt that this must have been so. The finding of the learned judge upon this point is also, in this respect, directly in favor of the Upper. It is: \u201cthat the anchor of the Upper was about 200 feet south of the wharf and almost in line with the centre of the wharf extending in about 11 or 12 feet of water.\u201d This, therefore, disposes of the only ground for the imputation of negligence in the selection of the place of anchoring, and there remains nothing to support the decree of the court below.\nI do not discuss the evidence in detail, as I entirely agree in the conclusions of fact at which the judge in the Maritime Court arrived. I only differ from him as regards the legal consequences of these facts, which, in my opinion, should have been directly opposite to those which the decree has attached to them.\nThe decree should be reversed and the action dismissed with costs to the appellant in both courts. FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI adopt all the conclusions of the learned judge before whom this case was tried, except the one as to the right of the respondent to recover.\nTo sustain the action it is necessary to establish by evidence that the appellant\u2019s schooner was guilty of negligence in dropping her anchor where she did; that the damage to the Erie Belle was caused by the Striking on the anchor; and that the Erie Belle was not guilty of contributory negligence.\nAccording to the facts as found by the judge, there was not any negligence on the part of the schooner. He negatives the allegation that there was any custom in relation to placing buoys over the anchor in such places, and clearly shows that it having been so at one time it was abandoned.\nThere was then no want of duty on the part of the schooner in not buoying her anchor.\nWas she otherwise guilty of negligence? If so I cannot see in what it consists. It was an exposed situation, and it has been shown to have been a necessary and customary caution for vessels going to the wharf to drop their anchors about two hundred yards from the wharf to haul off by, and, in case of the wind blowing hard on the south end of the wharf, particularly necessary. The finding of the judge shows she dropped anchor in a line with the centre of the wharf and hauled in on the west side of it. If she had dropped it in a line with the east side of the wharf, or further east of that line, there might in such a case have been a liability to intimate its position by a buoy or otherwise, so that a steamer or other vessel might have the power of avoiding it, but placed as it was I can see no obligation that rested on the schooner to give any intimation whatever. The commander had no reason to suppose that every steamer coming to the east side of the wharf would touch an anchor so placed, and the fact that the Erie Belle came in to the wharf safely shows that the anchor was not improperly placed, and had she gone out as she should have done by the same course the damage would not have been occasioned. The schooner was not guilty of the breach of any law or custom. She had the common law right to do as she did, and the contributory negligence of the Erie Belle, as so properly found by the judge, was the sole cause of the damage. In such a case the law throws no liability on the schooner to pay damages. In cases of collision if both vessels are to blame each party bears his own loss.\nAbbott at page 614 (11th ed.) says:\nBut of the sea as of the road the law recognizes no inflexible rule, the neglect of which by one party will dispense with the exercise of ordinary care and caution in the other, one person being in fault will not dispense with another\u2019s using ordinary care for himself. Two things must concur to support this action\u2014a collision by default of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff.\nWhere damage has been caused in cases of collision and both vessels were found in fault.\nThe principles upon which judgments have been so given are, however, inapplicable to this case. The respondent, as I view the law, cannot recover if guilty of contributory negligence, and such has been found by the judge.\nThe law of the road, I consider, is that to govern the decision of this case, and under that law a party guilty of contributory negligence cannot recover. I, however, am of the opinion, independently of that defence, that the schooner was not in fault.\nBesides, by the evidence of the captain of the Erie Belle striking took place 100 yards from the wharf, while it is shown that the anchor was dropped 200 yards from it. In that case the striking must have been on a rock or part of the old pier.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellants with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe evidence fails to satisfy my mind that the persons in charge of the defendant\u2019s vessel, the M.C. Upper, were guilty of any actionable negligence.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case as stated in his petition is, that the M.C. Upper, while moored at the west side of a pier at Kingsville, situate on the open shore of Lake Erie, had her anchor dropped in the channel by which vessels calling at Kingsville usually enter and depart, and that by reason of there being no buoy to indicate the position of the anchor, that plaintiff\u2019s vessel, the Erie Belle, backing out from the pier by the said channel, struck the anchor of the M.C. Upper and was damaged, and the plaintiff averred that the said disaster and the losses and damage consequent thereon occurred through and are imputable solely to the wrongful neglect and improper conduct of the master and crew of the M.C. Upper in placing and allowing the said anchor to remain in a shallow channel used for purposes of navigation without any buoy, signal or other thing whatsoever to indicate its position; and had a buoy or other signal been placed where the said anchor lay the said accident would not have occurred, and the plaintiff averred that it is the custom and usage of the said port for all vessels having an anchor out to mark its position by a buoy or signal, and that the defendant, in ignoring said custom and usage and refusing to conform to it, directly brought about the said disaster. The defendant, in his answer, alleged that the place which in the plaintiff\u2019s petition had been called the \u201cPort of Kingsville,\u201d is a place on the shore of Lake Erie, where vessels go to load timber and staves, but is not a regular port, and that vessels which go to load there, on account of its exposed position and the danger that might be occasioned to them by shifting or rising winds, are compelled, for their safety and to prevent their grounding, to have an anchor and from 50 to 70 fathoms of chain out so as to be ready to heave upon it and haul the vessel offshore in case it should be necessary, and that the said vessel, the M.C. Upper, then being in charge of the defendant\u2019s servants, the master and crew of the said vessel, was loading at the dock at Kingsville and had her anchor out, and at the time of the alleged disaster the crew of the said vessel were endeavoring to haul the said vessel off as the wind was rising and the vessel was grounding astern, and the person in charge of the Erie Belle and her crew knew that the said M.C. Upper had her anchor out and that her crew were hauling on it and endeavoring to haul the said vessel off, and that if the damage to the Erie Belle was occasioned as alleged by the anchor of the M.C. Upper, the same arose from the negligent and careless manner in which those in charge of the Erie Belle backed that vessel out, and the defendant alleged that there is no such custom or usage at the place as stated in plaintiff\u2019s petition as to mark the position of the anchor when out by a buoy or signal.\nAt the trial the contention of the plaintiff was, that while the M.C. Upper was moored on the west side of the wharf at Kingsville, her anchor was dropped some distance out in the lake east of the eastern side of the wharf extended, thus bringing her cable directly across the end of the wharf from east to west, and that though the cable when hauled taut, as it was when the Erie Belle entered, did indicate that the anchor was about in range with the westerly side of the wharf extended, that circumstance was attributable to the fact that the cable was fouled with an obstruction consisting of the corner of an old pier or crib, and that by reason thereof the true position of the anchor which was on the east of the east side of the wharf extended, which was the course of the Erie Belle to enter and leave by, was not indicated.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention, on the contrary, was that there was no custom or usage there of buoying anchors, and that the strain on the anchor chain, when the crew of the \u201cUpper\u201d were hauling on it all the time the Erie Belle was at Kingsville, truly indicated the position of the anchor as well as a buoy, which position was the spot where the plaintiff contended that the Upper\u2019s cable was fouled by the corner of the old pier.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried came to the conclusion that Kingsville is situate as described in the defendant\u2019s answer, and that it is not usual, nor is there any custom, to buoy the anchor in such a place. That there was nothing left of the pier which the plaintiff contended had fouled the chain of the M.C. Upper\u2019s anchor, which could foul or obstruct that chain, and that the theory of the plaintiff, that if the trend of the chain from the M.C. Upper\u2019s hawser hole would indicate that her anchor was not as far east as the plaintiff contended it was, that was owing to the fact that the chain had caught on and been fouled by the corner of the old pier, must be abandoned, and he found further that in fact the anchor of the M.C. Upper was dropped about 200 feet south of the wharf extended, and about in line with the centre of the wharf extended in about 11 or 12 feet of water. The precise position, I think, upon the evidence, would be at a point from 10 to 15 feet west of the centre line of the wharf produced, and, in fact, at the place where the anchor cable when hauled taut indicated it to be, that is to say, at the spot which the plaintiff insisted was the corner of the old pier; and that being the position of the M.C. Upper\u2019s anchor, such position was as well indicated by the hauling on the anchor as if it had been buoyed, and, moreover, the evidence shows that if such was the position of the anchor it was not in the line by which the Erie Belle entered and by which she should have backed out, and that in fact those in charge of the Upper were not guilty of the negligence charged or of any negligence. How the learned judge notwithstanding could find, as he did, that it was misconduct and want of proper care and prudence on the part of the Upper in dropping her anchor where she did without buoying the same, I fail to see. This latter finding is not, in my judgment, supported by the evidence, nor is it consistent with the other findings of the learned judge himself.\nThe plaintiff has, in my judgment, failed to establish the position on which he based his claim, and if the anchor of the Upper was, as I think it is established to have been, to the west of the centre line of the wharf produced, its position was sufficiently indicated to those in charge of the Erie Belle by the strain upon it in hauling in the cable, and if, under such circumstances, it was the Upper\u2019s anchor which did to the Erie Belle the damage complained of, I cannot see that those in charge of the Upper can be said to have been guilty of any negligence to which such damage can properly be attributed.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal of the defendant should be allowed, and the cross appeal of the plaintiff dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal and cross appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Miller & Cox.\nSolicitors for respondent: Patterson & McHugh.\n[1] L.R. 9 Ex. 71. and 1 App. Cas. 754.\n",

G. (appellant) in his quality of tutor to M. L. H. C. R, a minor, and Dame H. P. respondent), universal legatee of her late husband L. R., who had had possession of the minor's property (his grandchild) as tutor, the following items, viz.: $5,466.63 (for stock of goods sold by L. R. to his son) and $451.07, and $00.76, for \"cash received at the counter,\" charged by the respondent in her account, were contested.\nn 1871, L. L. R. the minor's father, married one M. C G., and by contract of marriage obtained from his father, L. R., two immoveable properties em avancement d'hoirie. At the same time L. R., the father retired from business and left to L. L. R., his son the whole of his stock in trade which was valued at $5,466.63. making an inventory thereof. L. L. R. died in 1872 leaving one child, said M: L. H. C. R., and L. R., her grandfather, was appointed her tutor. There was no evidence that the stock in trade had been sold by the father and purchased by the son, or that the father gave it to his son. However, when L. R. in his capacity of tutor to his grandchild, made an inventory of his son's succession, he charged his son with this amount of $5,466.63.\nHeld, (reversing the judgment of the court below) that it was for the respondent to prove that there had been a sale of the stock in trade by L. R., to his son L. L. R, the minor's father and that there being no evidence of such a sale the respondent could not legally charge the minor with that amount.\nAs to the other two items these were granted to the respondent by the Court of Queen's Bench on the ground that, although they had been entered as cash received at the counter there was evidence that they had been already entered in the ledger. The only evidence to support this fact was the affidavit of one H\u00e9bert the bookkeeper of L. R. filed with the reddition de comptes before notary, prior to the institution of this action.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court below, that the affidavit of H\u00e9bert was inadmissible evidence and therefore these two items could not be charged against the minor.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (appeal side) ([1]),'reversing judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellant. The facts of the case are as follows :\nLouis Ludger Richard, of Stanfold, in the district of Arthabaska, died on the 15th of July, 1872, leaving one child Marie Louise Hermine C\u00e9lanre Richard issue of his marriage with Dame G\u00e9lanire Gagnon. On the 23rd October of the same year the Honorable Losis Richard father of Louis Ludger Richard, was appointed tutor to the minor child of his son. Thereupon Louis Richard took \"possession of the estate and succession of his son and administered it up to the time of his death which occurred on the 13th November, 1876. By his last will Mr. Louis Richard constituted his widow Dame Hermine Prince, the present respondent, his universal legatee, and she took possession of all the property of her deceased son, Louis Ludger Richard, which then belonged to her minor grand-child. On the 8th January, 1877, Dame C\u00e9lanire Gagnon, widow of Louis .Ludger Richard, was appointed tutrix to her child, and in June, 1879, she instituted an action against the present respondent to recover an account of the administration of the minor's property by Louis Richard, as tutor, and by his widow, since his death. On 21st February, 1880, the Superior Court at Arthabaska rendered judgment condemning the present respondent to account in the manner asked for by the action. In conformity with this judgment the respondent rendered an account. Pending these proceedings, Madame C\u00e9lanire Gagnon (widow Louis Ludger Richard) having married a second time, her father, V. Antoine Gagnon, was appointed tutor to the minor, and took up the proceedings in that quality.\nThe account rendered by the respondent showed a total expenditure by the tutor M. Louis Richard of\n$15,362 07\u00bd\nand a total receipt of\n15,270 51\u00bd\nleaving a balance of\n$91 56\nin favor of the respondent.\nThe appellant contested several items charged as expenditure, and the court of the first instance, in its judgment, struck off the following items from the expenditure :\u2014\n1st. A stock of merchandise\n$5466 63\n2nd. Upon the expenses of the rendering of the account.\n25 95\n3rd. A promissory note by Louis Ludger Richard to his father\n600.00\n4th A certain sum entered in the books as\n\"cash received at the counter\"\n451.07\n5th. Another similar sum\n190.16\n$6,734 41\nThe judgment also added to the receipts, a few small sums amounting in all to $105.30.\nThe result now was this:\u2014\n1st. The receipts by this addition of $105.30 were increased to the total sum of\n$15,375 81\u00bd\n2nd. The expenses being cut off of the sum\nof $6734411 were reduced to\n8,627 66\u00bc\n$ 6,748 15\nThis left a balance of $6748.15 against the respondent, for which amount judgment was rendered against her. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, that court agreed with the court below upon several items, but declared that the item of $5,466.63 (for the stock of goods) and the items of $451077 and $190.76 for c cash received at the counter \"had been improperly struck off from the expenditure and should be reinstated therein.\nThese sums being reinstated in the expenditure, the total expenditure then amounted to $1,736.12; this left a balance of $639.69 against the respondent.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the three items struck off by the Court of Queen's Bench were under consideration, viz: 1st $5466633 (for the stock of goods); 2nd, item $451.07; and 3rd, item $190766 for c cash received at the counter.\"Item of $5466.63 (stock of goods).\nThis item was entered in the account, under the head of expenditure, and is in the following language:\n\"The accounting party charges in expenditure, the sum of $5,466.63, being part of the sum of $5,676944 entered in the inventory under the head of debts due to the said Louis Richard for goods sold and delivered to the said L. L. Richard, as per statement now fyled as exhibit H.\"\nThe contestation of this item is as follows:\n\"And the party accounted to declares that she contests the following items of the account:\"\n\"1. The sum of $5466633 for goods sold and delivered to the said L. L Richard as per statement\"\n\"Because the goods in question never were sold by the said honorable Louis Richard to the said L. L. Richard, but on the contrary had been given to him and were charged against the said L. L. Richard in the books of the said honorable Louis Richard several months only after the death of the said L. L, Richard to wit, in November, 1872. That moreover, that sum of $5,466.63 is charged for a stock of goods, the inventory of which had been made more than six months r before the said L. L. Richard had obtained delivery of the goods in question, the said honorable Louis Richard, having continued his trade during the said six months, and having sold a large portion of the goods, thus entered in the inventory.\"\nThere was no writing to establish whether it was as a gift or as a sale that these goods had been left by the father to his son nor was there any witness who could relate what was the agreement which may have taken place between the father and the son with regard to those goods.\nIt was proved, however, that in October, 1871, Louis Ludger Richard, who up to that time had been a clerk in his father's establishment, was married to the plaintiff Marie C\u00e9lanire Gagnon; and that Mr. Richard on that occasion withdrew from business, and left him the whole of his stock-in-trade, valued, according to the inventory which was then taken of it, at the sum of $5,466.33. That inventory was closed on the same day that the marriage contract was passed, or on the previous day.\nBy this marriage contract, Mr. Richard, the father, gave to his son en avancement d'hoirie, a house to make a dwelling-house, and the store or building wherein he had carried on his trade at Stanfold for a great many years.\nAs the other two items $451.07 and $190.76 a Mr. H\u00e9bert, the bookkeeper of Mrs. L. Richard, in his affidavit, which is appended to the first account rendered before a notary by the respondent, declares as follows:\n\" To my personal knowledge, all the different amounts above mentioned and forming the sum of $693455 are entered in the cash book by the said Louis Richard and are entered under the heading of \"cash received at the counter.\" This Mr. H\u00e9bert was not examined as a witness having died previous to the institution of the action.\nAs to items $451.07 and $190.76, making together the sum of $641.83. They were allowed on the ground that they are twice credited to the minor in Mr. Richard's books, once in the account of moneys received for cash sales over the counter, and again in the general account book. The Superior Court rejected this charge, as being entirely unsupported by evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench restored it.\nThe appellant, thereupon, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Irvine, Q. C, and Mr. Felton, with him, for appellant:\nThe first point to be considered is, the item number I in the d\u00e9bats de comptes, amounting to $5,466.33, charged in the account, for goods sold and delivered by the Honorable Louis Richard to his son Louis Ludger Richard. The pretension of the appellant is, that this merchandise which formed the stock in trade of Mr. Louis Richard, was not sold but given by him to his son. There is conflicting evidence upon this head, but the onus of proof is upon the respondent to show that these things were sold, and that the amount charged was due by Louis Ludger Richard for the price of them. At the time of the death of Louis Ludger Richard this stock of goods was in his possession and had been in his possession for several months. Louis Richard, the father was a merchant who kept accurate books of account, and yet no entry was made in any of them showing that his son was indebted to him in any sum of money, as the price of this stock, until several months after the death of Ludger Richard, when an entry to that effect was made by Louis Richard although from time to time various small items were charged against Ludger Richard during his lifetime and at the dates when the payments were made. Under these circumstances, if the respondent desires to claim against the succession of her son for the price of these goods it was upon her to establish by proof that they had been sold to him and that this sum of money was due. No satisfactory evidence to this effect has been given.\nAs to items $451.07 and $l90.76. The only evidence is that of H\u00e9bert, who died before the case came on for trial, and who had under other circumstances, made an exparte affidavit in which he stated that these amounts taken from the account book known as the \"livre de recettes\" were also included in the cash receipts, argent au comptoir.\" It is plain that in order to recover this amount in contradiction to her own account books it was incumbent on the respondent to establish its correctness by legal evidence. No proof has been attempted beyond the production of the affidavit of H\u00e9bert it is difficult to find any precedent for such a case The court below has charged the minor, who is interested in this account, with a large sum of money on the evidence of a witness never examined in court whom the appellant has had no opportunity of cross-examining, and who has in fact given no legal evidence whatever. The books of account of the late Mr. Richard and of his succession were carefully kept, and it is difficult to suppose that they would have contained so serious an error as H\u00e9bert's affidavit suggests and one which must have been continued and repeated over a considerable length of time. Moreover an examination of the books will shew that the statement of Mr. H\u00e9bert is impossible On many of the days on which the amounts are shewn by the \"livre de recettes\" to have been paid the amount received as argent an comptoir\" was not sufficiently larffe to include them Mr. Laurier, Q. C, for respondent:\nAs to the first item $5466 the Superior Court came to the conclusion that L. L. Richard had received the stock in trade from his father as a pure gift at the time he went into business. The Court of appeals held that it was not a gift, and that it was properly charged as a debt due by L. L. Richard to his father. The question therefore is whether the stock of goods put in the hands of his son by Mr. Richard the father at the time of the former's marriage was an absolute gift or not? The evidence in this case does not support the appellant's \"pretension Casual conversations are not sufficient to prove an absolute gift or a don manuel. See Richard Voycr ([2])\nI submit also that a donation cannot be proved by parole evidence but must be proved according to the ordinary rules of law.\nThe principle which decides that a donation of move-able property exceeding $50 must be proved by written evidence, though the donation can be made by verbal agreement, is the principle which applies to all contracts in the French law The contract of sale for instance, can be made by verbal agreement but if it exceeds $50, it has to be proved by written evidence Nothing is more certain. The don manuel is no exception to this rule, and though the point was at onetime controverted, it can no longer admit of a doubt, since the latest commentaries upon the code Napol\u00e9on.\nMoreover, notwithstanding what has been said by the learned counsel for the appellant I submit there is proof of record establishing that there was a sale. .\nIn the first place Mr. Richard himself treated it as a sale and so entered it in his books But it is said that Mr. Richard made that entry in his books only after his son's death. If this contention, on the part of the appellant, means anything, it means that Mr. Richard would have been guilty of a most dishonest act, that after having made a gift to his son he would have, after the latter's death taken the means of depriving his child of it. But the facts as proved vindicate his memory.\nIn the first place it is true that Mr. Richard made that entry in his day book and in his ledger only after his son's death but there was an entry made in another book and the whole circumstances are fully explained by the testimony of Octave Ouellet. In October, 1871 previous to Ludger Richard's marriage and to Mr. Richard's withdrawing from business. Octave Ouellet was employed by the latter to make the inventory of the stock.\nThat inventory is entered in a book marked \"H\" in this cause; the goods footed up to the sum of $5909.42. Ouellet says that Mr. Richard let his son have these goods at the price of 16s. 9d. in the \u00a3. Then there are added, a certain quantity of goods from the Somerset store, for which Ludger Richard was paying the full price. The total amount of the goods from the stores of Stanfold and Somerset amounted to $6574 61\nThe following entry is then found in the book, viz.:\nCr. by deduction of 3s. 9d. upon the account of the inventory of 1871, to wit:\n$5,909422\n1,107 98\n$5,466 63\nOuellet says in his deposition that that entry was made by himself and that to the best of his recollection it was so made at the time that the inventory was taken. The following year after Ludger Richard's death he was again called to take part in the inventory of the estate, and then be advised Mr. Richard to report that entry from that book, to his daybook and his ledger.\nAll this not only explains how, and when, the entries were made in the books of Mr. Richard but it also shows that the transaction was a sale that there was a price agreed upon and delivery.\nAs to the two other items, one of $450.07 and the other of $190.76, which have been struck off the expenditure, the appellant has made the best possible proof under the circumstances, that these two sums had been entered in the receipts, as c cash at the counter,\" and again in the collection. This double accounting is due to the fact that the appellant viz: the present respondent has entered in the receipts the cash received at the counter and also the cash received for collections according to the ledger when such collections were also included in the c cash received at the counter.\"\nH\u00e9bert who could have established that fact in a precise manner, is dead and could not be heard as a witness. His affidavit alone cannot make a complete evidence But we believe that this is one of the cases where in a case for an account, the appellant, the accounting party, has a right to he believe don her oath after having proved the practice followed by Mr. Richard and the death of her principal witness\nTASOHEREAU, J., delivered the judgment of the court:\nIn this case, I am opinion to allow the appeal. Three items of the d\u00e9bats de comptes are in controversy. As to the first one, amounting to $5,466.63, the only question is, were goods to that amount sold by the honorable Louis Richard to his son Ludger Richard? Upon the respondent, who alleges such a sale, was the onus of proving it. Now, where is the evidence of it in this record? I cannot find any and the Court of Appeal, although it reversed the judgment of the Superior Court as to this could not find any. If there was a sale what were the conditions and terms of payment? None that I can find out in the evidence adduced On the cross-examination of the witness 'Jean Baptiste Allard, the respondent attempted to prove terms of payment, but not only failed to do so, but established clearly that Louis Richard never sold these goods to his son\u2014but gave them under certain charges and conditions\nThe appellant has, in my opinion, clearly proved that these goods were a donation by his father to him; but I base my judgment on the ground that the respondent had to prove a sale and failed to prove one.\nAs to the other two items submitted to our consideration, I am also of opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court was right, and that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing it. They are small items one of $451.07 and the other of $190.76 They have been allowed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that, in Richard's books The minor child is twice credited for them once in the account of monies received for cash sales over the counter, and once in the general account book. Now, in order to recover this amount, in contradiction to her own account books the respondent had to establish it by legal and clear evidence. What evidence has she produced? None whatever but an affidavit of a deceased person given, voluntarily and extra judicially, before a commissioner of the Superior Court. it may well be asked what authority has this Commissioner to receive this affidavit. If he had none there is no affidavit, no oath whatever. But leaving this question aside, and taking this affidavit as duly given, how could it be admitted as evidence in this case is a question which the respondent's counsel failed to answer at the hearing before us. The oath of the respondent cannot be construed in her favor. She swears that these items are correct, hut swears it, not of her own knowledge, but only because H\u00e9bert, the deceased person, said it in his affidavit. It is unfortunate that H\u00e9bert died before he could be examined in this case, but, according to the Court of Appeal, it is not the respondent's misfortune whose witness he would have been that such should be the case, but the appellant's misfortune.\nThis appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs in all the courts against the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Felton & Blanchard.\nSolicitors for respondent: Laurier & Lavergne.\nApplication was made on behalf of respondent to the Privy Council for leave to appeal but leave was refused.\n[1] 2 Dorion's Q.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nCriminal Appeal\u2014Indictment\u2014Misjoinder of Counts\u2014Evidence.\nAn indictment contained two counts, one charging the prisoner with murdering M. J. T. on the 10th November, 1881; the other with manslaughter of the said M. J. T. on the same day. The Grand Jury found \"a true bill.\" A motion to quash the indictment for misjoinder was refused, the counsel for the prosecution electing to proceed on the first count only. Held,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the Court a quo, that the indictment was sufficient.\nThe prisoner was convicted of manslaughter in killing his wife, who died on the 10th November, 1881. The immediate cause of her death was acute inflammation of the liver, which the medical testimony proved might be occasioned by a blow or a fall against a hard substance. About three weeks before her death, (17th October preceding) the prisoner had knocked his wife down with a bottle: she fell against a door, and remained on the floor insensible for some time; she was confined to her bed soon afterwards and never recovered. Evidence was given of frequent acts of violence committed by the prisoner upon his wife within a year of her death, by knocking her down and kicking her in the side. On the reserved questions, viz., whether the evidence of assaults and violence committed by the prisoner upon the deceased, prior to the 10th November or the 17th October, 1881, was properly received, and whether there was any evidence to leave to the jury to sustain the charge in the first count of the indictment?\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the evidence was properly received, and that there was evidence to submit to the jury that the disease, which caused her death, was produced by the injuries inflicted by the prisoner.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] on points reserved at the trial of a criminal case.\nThe prisoner was tried and convicted of manslaughter at the St. John circuit in November, 1881. Chief Justice Allen, before whom the prisoner was tried, reserved the following case under the statute[2] for the consideration of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick:\n\"The prisoner was convicted of manslaughter at the Saint John circuit in November last, on an indictment containing two counts.\n\"The first count charged that he did on the 10th November, 1881, at the parish of Lancaster, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, kill and murder one Mary Janet Theal. \"The second count charged that he did on the 10th November, 1881, at the parish of Lancaster, &c., feloniously and wilfully kill and slay the said Mary Janet Theal.\n\"When the prisoner was arraigned, and before he pleaded, his counsel moved to quash the indictment on the ground of the misjoinder of the counts for murder and manslaughter, and that the finding of the grand jury 'A true bill,' was uncertain. The counsel for the prosecution having elected to proceed on the count for murder only, I refused to quash the indictment, and the prisoner pleaded 'not guilty.' In opening the case, the counsel for the prosecution stated that he would prove the ill-treatment of the deceased by the prisoner for a considerable time before her death; that his systematic abuse brought her to the condition which caused her death; that he had beaten her on the 17th October last, and that she died on the 10th November.\n\"The evidence shewed that the prisoner was in the habit of using violence to the deceased, by knocking her down and kicking her on different occasions, for more than a year before her death, which took place on the 10th November last.\n\"One witness testified that the deceased had sent for her in October last, she could not state the day; that she found the deceased ill in bed, her left eye black and bloodshot, and complaining of pain in her back and right side. That she asked deceased in presence of the prisoner what caused her black eye, to which she answered that the prisoner wanted her to get out of bed and get him a bottle of beer; that she (deceased) said she was tired and told him to get it himself; that he got out of bed and went for the beer; that she got up and followed him; that he met her in the door and hit her with a bottle; that she fell over against the door and did not know any more about it till she came to; that she did not know how long she lay there; that she got up and crawled into bed in the morning. That the witness asked the prisoner the cause of his doing this, to which he answered that he did not recollect doing it. This witness visited the deceased frequently between that time and her death, sometimes remaining with her during the night, and during the principal part of the time the deceased was unable to sit up; and complained of great pain. Other witnesses proved that the prisoner knocked the deceased down and kicked her at different times, one in June or July, 1880, others in September and December, 1880; another in January or February, 1881; another in March, 1881, and between April and July, 1881. Some of the witnesses swore that he kicked her in the side; and that on two occasions when he was beating her, he swore that he would take her life if he was hanged for it. It was also proved that in consequence of his violence one night she was obliged to leave the house, and remained in the barn all night. The evidence of the assaults was given after the medical testimony, and was received subject to objection by the prisoner's counsel, that no evidence could be given of assaults prior to the 10th November, when Mrs. Theal died; or, at all events, prior to the 17th October, as stated by the counsel for the prosecution in opening the case.\n\"Dr. White, who visited the deceased at the request of her brother on the 26th of October, prior to her death, stated that he found her in bed, that she complained of severe pain and soreness in her right side and tenderness on pressure directly in the region of the liver. That he visited her again on the 7th November and found all her symptoms considerably aggravated, the pain in her side greater than before, more fulness, and extending more over the liver, and her pulse much more rapid than on the 26th October. That she was very weak and complained of pain in the region of the liver, extending from the region of the right to the left lobe, and at that time he considered her condition very critical. This witness made a post mortem examination the day after Mrs. Theal's death, with the assistance of Dr. McFarlane. He stated that there was a great deal of fulness on the side of the deceased, extending from the right side over to the left in the region where she complained of the pain, that the condition of the liver was unusually large, about twice its natural size; that they examined the liver very carefully and found it much darker than its natural color, very soft and breaking down with the slightest pressure of the finger, particularly the right lobe, indicating that it was very much disorganized and had undergone a high degree of inflammation, and that, as it broke down, a peculiar fluid issued from it, which, though not pure pus, they concluded contained pus matter; that their opinion was, that the disease of the liver was the immediate cause of death, and that they believed the disease of the liver to be acute, and thought the disease was of three or four weeks duration; that they did not notice any indications of chronic disease in any of the vital organs; that a blow or a fall on a hard substance might cause the acute inflammation of the liver; that inflammation would cause the appearance of the liver which they found. That in his experience, cases of acute inflammation of the liver were not common in this climate.\n\"On cross-examination he stated that he could not say positively what caused the inflammation of the liver of the deceased; that a change of temperature might cause it, by a person being overheated and then exposed to a lower degree of temperature; that extreme heat might cause it, and it was very common in tropical climates. That they found no mark on the right side of the abdomen over the region of the liver That a. blow might be received in the abdomen which would cause death without producing any local manifestation, and he believed a blow could be given which would cause inflammation of the liver without producing any external mark.\n\"Dr. McFarlane, the other medical witness who assisted at the post mortem, stated that they found the liver much larger than in a normal state\u2014that it was very much softened and broke easily on pressure, and when separated, a large quantity of brownish fluid flowed out, in which, in his opinion, there was pus; that it had undergone a process of disintegration, shewing that serious structural changes had taken place, exhibiting that the liver was in an advanced stage of inflammation; that he considered the immediate cause of death was acute inflammation of the liver: it had probably lasted for two or three weeks; that acute inflammation was caused in tropical climates by using alcoholic stimulants; that it was not a common disease in the temperate zone; that he thought it might be caused by a kick or a blow, or external violence, without leaving any external mark.\n\"On cross-examination, he said that he did not know how the inflammation of the liver was caused; that it would not be remarkable in this case that there were no external marks of violence; that he had known cases of persons receiving injuries in the abdomen without any external marks; that the injury which would cause the state of the liver they found, might have remained eight or nine weeks; that in ordinary cases pus begins to form in two or three weeks after the inflammation commences; that a patient would feel pain very soon after acute inflammation commenced; that acute inflammation would be likely to ran its course in from eight to ten days; that in his opinion inflammation of the liver as they found it, would be more apt to be caused by external violence than by other causes; that the effects of food, a heavy meal, might cause inflammation; that pus begins to form between two and three weeks after acute inflammation.\n\"I directed the jury to consider: 1st. Whether inflammation of the liver was the immediate cause of Mrs. Theal's death; and 2nd, If it was, was such inflammation produced by natural causes, or by injuries and violence inflicted by the prisoner. If the cause of death was inflammation of the liver, and that was produced by a series of acts of violence committed by the prisoner, at least, if they were committed within a year of the death, the crime would be murder or manslaughter according to circumstances, though no one act of violence by itself would have produced that result. I directed them to exclude from their consideration, evidence of assaults committed more than a year before the death. I explained to the jury the principles which would distinguish murder from manslaughter. The questions which I reserved for the opinion of the court are\u2014\n\"1st. Whether the indictment should have been quashed for the reasons before stated,\n\"2nd. Whether the evidence of assaults and violence committed by the prisoner upon the deceased, prior to the 10th November or the 17th October, 1981, was properly received.\n\"3rd. Whether there was any evidence to leave to the jury to sustain the charge in the first count of the indictment.\n\"(On this point it was understood that all the evidence might be referred to.) \"\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the conviction should be affirmed, Mr. Justice Palmer dissenting. The prisoner thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 49 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\nMr. Lash, Q. C. for appellant: On the first question I rely upon Mr. Justice Palmer's judgment[3]. The counts being joined are repugnant and contradictory, and therefore bad. The motion to quash was made before the crown officer elected to proceed on the first count only, and in a criminal case the power of amendment is not given to the court on a matter of substance without the consent of the Grand Jury.\nThen as to the second question, the evidence of assaults a year and a half previous to her death was clearly inadmissible. The prisoner was the husband of the deceased and in the habit of quarrelling, and assaulting his wife, but as it was proved that prior to the 17th of October, 1881, she was in her usual good health, evidence of assaults prior to that date was improperly received. It was proved that the death was caused by acute inflammation of the liver, and if that was caused by violence it could only be by recent violence. Roscoe's Criminal Evidence[4].\nThe case of The Queen v. Lute[5], though not in favor of the prisoner, is important as it is the converse of this case. In that case had the indictment been for manslaughter, the evidence would have been improper.\nThen was there evidence to leave to the jury on the count of murder, of assault to causing death? [The learned counsel then reviewed and commented on the evidence, and contended that the death had not been the result of violence.]\nMr. E. McLeod, Q.C., for the Crown.\n[On the first point he relied on Reg. v. Young,[6]; Reg. v. Strange,[7]; Reg. v. Downing,[8]; Reg. v. Trueman,[9]; Reg. v. Davis,[10]; and Reg. v. Craddock,[11]; and contended that the evidence of ill treatment prior to the 17th October was properly received to shew the prisoner's intention, (Archbold Crim. Ev. 226,) and that there was sufficient evidence to justify the learned Chief Justice in leaving the question to the jury, whether the death was caused by the prisoner's violence.]\nRITCHIE, C J. After reading the reserved case proceeded as follows:\u2014\nAs to the first point, it is too clear for argument, that there are cases where a greater offence includes the less, that upon an indictment for the greater the prisoner may be found guilty of the less. Of this, the case of murder and manslaughter is an example, for upon an indictment for murder, the prisoner may be found guilty of manslaughter. It is, therefore, unnecessary and useless to add a second count, but if a second count is added for manslaughter, how can this make the indictment bad? It cannot be doubted that offences of the same character, though differing in degree, may be united in the same indictment, and the prisoner tried on both at the same time, and, on the trial, he may be convicted on the one and not upon the other.\nIt is true that, if different felonies be stated in several counts of an indictment, while no objection can be made to the indictment on that account, in point of law, the judge, in his discretion, may quash the indictment, or require the counsel for the prosecution to select one of the felonies and confine himself to that. This is technically termed putting the prosecutor to his election, and is done when the prisoner, by reason of two charges being inquired into at the same time, would be embarrassed in his defence, or, as it has been said, lest it should \"confound\" him in his defence, a matter, however, only of prudence and discretion, to be exercised by the judge. In this case, the prosecutor elected to proceed on the count for murder, and the prisoner was tried on that count alone. There was no necessity for this election, for the prisoner was in precisely the same position on the trial upon the count for murder that he would have been on the two counts for murder and manslaughter. Upon the count for murder, the prisoner was not found guilty of the murder, but was found guilty of manslaughter. The result would have been precisely the same, had he been tried on both counts; he would not have been found guilty on the count charging murder, he would have been found guilty on the count charging manslaughter. I am wholly at a loss to conceive upon what principle or technical rule of law any objection to the course pursued can be sustained, or how the prisoner was in any way embarrassed or confounded in his defence, or otherwise aggrieved.\nAs to the second point, evidence of other facts are admissible where those facts tend to prove the point in issue, as where the intent of the prisoner forms part of the matter in issue, and such other facts tend to establish the intent of the prisoner in committing the act in question; so the deliberate menaces or threats of a prisoner made at a former time are admissible, when they tend to prove the intent of the party and the prisoner's malice against the deceased.\nIt was quite proper on the count for murder to give evidence of the prisoner's assaults and threats to shew the animus of the prisoner.\nOn the third question, I think there was evidence the learned Chief Justice could not withdraw from the jury, and quite sufficient to justify them in arriving at the conclusion they did, that the deceased came to her death, not from natural causes, but by reason of the violent and unprovoked assaults committed on her by the prisoner. The evidence shows that the deceased was in good health on the night when defendant assaulted her, and though no person witnessed the assault, it is very apparent from the evidence that it was of the most violent character; and this evidence the judge was, in my opinion, bound to submit to the jury, and from which, I think, they could form a very accurate estimate of the extent of the violence\u2014and which, in connection with the medical testimony, justified the jury in concluding that from the effects of such violence the deceased gradually languished until she died.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and HENRY, JJ., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe questions reserved in this case do not present to my mind any point of any diffculty. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed upon all points, and the appeal be dismissed. No doubt, it is quite unnecessary to insert in an indictment a count charging a homicide, amounting to manslaughter only, in addition to a count charging the homicide to have taken place under circumstances amounting to murder; for the prisoner, being put on his trial for the murder, although acquitted of that crime, may upon the same count be convicted of manslaughter. That the joinder of two such counts is unnecessary, is all that can be said about it. The homicide charged in such case is but one, and it is the presence or absence of malice aforethought in the committal of that offence which gives to it the character of murder or of manslaughter. The manslaughter charged in the count for manslaughter being comprehended in the count for murder, a prisoner, when he has pleaded to, and is given in charge to the jury upon this latter count only, is, in truth and substance, given in charge upon every thing included in that count, and therefore upon the charge of manslaughter, just as much as if he had pleaded to, and had been given in charge to the jury, upon the two counts; the insertion therefore of these two counts, although quite unnecessary, does not lay the indictment open to the exception that it contains two separate counts for distinct felonies, within the meaning of the rule, that a prisoner ought not to be charged with several felonies in the same indictment; even where that rule does apply, it is a matter left to the prudence and discretion of the judge, whether he will or not quash the indictment,\u2014a discretion which he usually exercises by quashing, if there appears to him to be any danger that, by pleading to the whole indictment, the prisoner might be confounded in his defence or prejudiced in his challenge of the jury. See Young v. Rex in error[12]. But where the crime charged in the second count, as here, is involved in the crime charged in the first count, it is plain that the prisoner could not possibly be prejudiced. It was contended, however, that the indictment by reason of its containing the two counts was incurably defective as containing two inconsistent charges, namely, a charge in the second count that a man already killed with malice aforethought was afterwards killed again without such malice, a point which, if there were anything in it, is disposed of in Regina v. Downing[13]. Here the counsel for the crown only called upon the prisoner to plead to, and he was only given in charge to the jury upon, the count for murder, and the trial which took place was quite regular.\nUpon the objection as to there not having been any evidence proper to be left to the jury, I cannot see how any doubt can be entertained upon the point of the sufficiency of the evidence to convict the prisoner; the jury was the tribunal to be satisfied; but that there was evidence, and that of considerable weight, to be submitted to them, does not, in my judgment, admit of a doubt.\nThe appeal must be dismissed and the conviction affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for appellant: John Kerr.\nSolicitor for respondent: E.

That your plaintiff was put to a large expense in searching for, and recovering the body of her said son, and in and about the funeral and burial of said body, to wit, $100 or thereabouts, and plaintiff claimed $2,000 and to have a lien on vessel, enforceable in the court.\nSarah Horn, the owner of the Garland, having intervened, demurred to the petition, and showed for cause of demurrer.\n\u201c1. That the said petition does not contain any matter wherein this court can ground any decree or give to the plaintiff any relief against the said steamboat Garland, or against the owner thereof, intervening.\n\u201cWherefore, and for divers other good causes of demurrer appearing in the said petition, the defendant demurs thereto, and prays judgment whether she ought to be compelled to make further or other answer to the said petition, and she prays to be hence dismissed with her costs.\n\u201cStatement in margin of demurrer of matters of law intended to be argued,\n\u201c1. The said petition does not allege or aver the death of the father of the said Joseph Monaghan, or that he has abandoned said child.\n\u201c2. The plaintiff as mother is not entitled, and has no remedy to recover damages for the loss of the child alleged in said petition as against the steamboat \u201cGarland\u201d or her owner.\n\u201c3. Even if the mother has a remedy for the loss of the child she is not authorized to pursue the remedy in her own name if she is suing under the statute in that behalf, that statute provides who must be the plaintiff.\n\u201c4. That the plaintiff by her said petition does not show that the collision which caused the death for which damage is claimed took place within the Province of Ontario.\n\u201c5. There was no obligation on the part of the mother to search for and recover the body of her said son, or to incur expense on account thereof, or for the funeral or burial of said body.\n\u201c6. That the plaintiff in and by the said petition does not set forth a cause of action against the said steamboat \u201cGarland\u201d within the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d\nThe petition having been amended by the introduction of the following averment:\u2014\u201cThat Joseph Patrick Monaghan, the father of the said Joseph Monaghan departed this life on the third day of July, 1869, intestate, and at the time of his death was a resident of the said city of Detroit\u201d the first matter alleged was disposed of. The Maritime Court of Ontario held the demurrer good and allowed the same with costs.\nMr. Scott for appellant:\u2014\nThe question raised by the demurrer, and on this appeal is: 1st, whether the appellant could sue for the death of her son and consequent loss of service independently of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act; and 2nd, if she had a right to sue, whether the Maritime Court of Ontario has jurisdiction to entertain a claim of this nature?\nAs to the first point, I submit that even if such an action would not lie at common law, the admiralty court, which acts upon different principles will entertain the action. There is no decision in, England, binding upon this court, holding that such an action would not lie at common law. The only decision, except at nisi prius, is Osborne v. Gillett[1], and although in that case the court decided, by a majority of one, that it would not lie, the weight of reasoning is, to my mind, strongly in favor of the view taken by Bramwell, B. The common law rule is not a rule which prevails in any other system of jurisprudence. The rules upon which they proceed in admiralty courts are the rules of the civil law; that court, independently of statute, would entertain the action brought by the mother for the death of her son and consequent loss of service. On this point I will refer the court to the 12th Central Law Journal[2], where the English authorities on this point are reviewed. See also Thompson on Negligence[3]; Plummer v. Webb[4]; \u201cThe Sea Gull,\u201d[5]; \u201cThe Highland Light\u201d[6]; \u201cThe Towanda,\u201d[7]; \u201cThe Charles Morgan,\u201d[8]; Holmes v. The O. & C.R.W. Co.,[9]; Dow v. Brown & Co.[10]\nIt is admitted a wrongful act has been done, and that another person has suffered in consequence of that wrongful act. Now, on what principle can it be successfully contended that you can bring an action if your servant is injured, and that you have no remedy, if killed?\nThe decision of Osborne v. Gillett1 is not binding upon this court, and was decided after the English law had been introduced in Upper Canada.\nThen, if appellant has a claim against the wrongdoer, the next question is whether our Maritime Court of Ontario has jurisdiction to entertain it?\nThe judgment of the learned judge in the court below is based upon the difference between the Admiralty Court Act of 1861[11], relying chiefly upon the absence in the Vice-Admiralty Court Act of the word \u201cany\u201d before the word \u201cclaims.\u201d The absence of this word is immaterial. In all the discussions upon the construction of the clause in the Admiralty Court Act, the question agitated was the extent of the meaning of the word \u201cdamage,\u201d and whether it included personal injury. No mention has anywhere been made of the word \u201cany\u201d as affecting the matter, and it is impossible for that word to have enlarged the meaning of the word \u201cdamage,\u201d or for its absence to narrow the sense in which that word is used.\nBy the Admiralty Court Act of 1861[12], it is enacted that \u201cthe High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for damage done by any ship.\u201d Whether this enactment comprises a claim for damage such as the one sought to be enforced in this case, has been the subject of much judicial discussion in the cases of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d[13]; \u201cThe Guldfaxe\u201d[14]; \u201cThe Explorer\u201d[15]; \u201cThe Beta\u201d[16]; Smith v. Brown[17]; James v. London and South-Western Railway Co.[18]; Simpson v. Blues[19]; and \u201cThe Franconia,\u201d[20]. The result of these cases may be shortly stated as being that the English Admiralty Court has held that this claim does come within the section, and that opinion has been upheld in \u201cThe Beta\u201d by the unanimous judgment of the judicial committee of the Privy Council; but, on the other hand, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Lord Blackburn doubting) has held that it does not, and that opinion has been concurred in by the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer. The Court of Appeal, in the case of \u201cThe Franconia\u201d was equally divided.\nIn this state of the English authorities, the law must be considered, as far as this Province is concerned, as settled by the decision in the case of \u201cThe Beta\u201d the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council being our court of final resort, and that unless a clear distinction can be shown between the jurisdiction conferred by the Acts upon the High Court of Admiralty and the Vice\u2011Admiralty Courts, the appellant is entitled to succeed.\nUnder the maritime law, a tort arising out of a collision, gives a lien on the ship doing the damage, and follows the ship, and when the ship comes within the jurisdiction of the admiralty, the only question for the court is whether a lien was created. See 7 Moore\u2019s P.C. 284; Anne Joehanne in Stuart\u2019s Vice Admiralty Reports,[21]; and I submit, therefore, that we had a perfect right to file this petition in the Maritime Court of Ontario for a lien upon the steamboat \u201cGarland,\u201d libelled at port Windsor, in the province of Ontario, and that the respondent\u2019s demurrer should have been dismissed.\nMr. McCarthy, Q.C.:\u2014\nThe appellant was a foreigner, the vessel was a foreign ship, and the collision took place upon foreign waters. It is under these extraordinary circumstances that a suit is brought against a foreign vessel in the Maritime Court of Ontario by the parent of the child killed.\nThe jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court is conferred by the first section of the act creating the court, 40 Vic. cap 21, and it confers the same rights and remedies arising out of or connected with navigation, &c., \u201cas such persons would have had in any then existing British Vice\u2011Admiralty Court if the jurisdiction of such court extended to the province of Ontario.\u201d By reference to the act defining the jurisdiction of the Vice Admiralty Court, 26 and 27 Vic. (Imperial) chap. 241, sec. 10, ss. 6, and comparing that with the 13th section of the Imperial Act 24 Vic., cap. 10, s.s. 7 and 13, conferring jurisdiction upon the High Court of Admiralty, it will be seen that, whereas the jurisdiction is given to the High Court of Admiralty over any claim for damage done by any ship, the jurisdiction conferred upon the Vice Admiralty Court is over \u201cclaims for damage done by any ship,\u201d the word \u201cany\u201d before \u201cclaims for damage\u201d being omitted.\nChap. 128 of R.S.O. does not give any remedy in rem such as is sought in the Maritime Court in this petition, but merely a right of action in personam, and the act conferring jurisdiction on the Vice Admiralty Courts, which defines and limits the extent of the jurisdiction of the Maritime Court of Ontario, does not purport to give a right of lien where none existed before; and the natural interpretation of the words \u201cclaim for damages\u201d does not mean damages to person but to property. See the reasoning in the case of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d[22]. Nor had the Vice Admiralty Courts, by virtue of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act or otherwise, jurisdiction over matters of the kind sought to be entertained here.\nUnless the appellant shows that he had a lien upon the ship, this court has no jurisdiction.\nI will now refer to the English cases to show that it is upon the words of the act respecting the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty, which are quoted, that jurisdiction over claims of this nature is said to exist. The first case is that of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d22; then \u201cThe Guldfaxe\u201d[23]. This case disposes of the argument that the court would have jurisdiction independent of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. \u201cThe Explorer\u201d[24]; \u201cThe Franconia\u201d[25]; S.C. on appeal[26]; also Smith v. Brown[27], in which the jurisdiction in the High Court of Admiralty was denied by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nIt is a mistake to say that the Maritime Court is governed entirely by the principles of the Roman or civil law[28].\nThe learned counsel also referred to the following cases:\n\u201cThe Leon\u201d[29]; \u201cThe Moxam\u201d[30]; \u201cThe Saxoma.\u201d[31]. If, however, it should be determined that the court had jurisdiction over such a claim, I will now contend that, having sued as parent of the child, independent of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, she cannot recover. The common law of England has been declared to be the law of Ontario.\nNo such action could be maintained or was maintainable at common law. The cause of action died with the person injured, and it was only under the Statute Law (Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, as the original act is known) ch. 128 R.S.O. in that province that an action for the loss of a person\u2019s life could be maintained, and by section three of that statute it is affirmatively enacted that such action should be brought in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased. The action can therefore only be brought in the name of the personal representative, which the petitioner in this case does not pretend she is. In support of the proposition that an action could not be maintained at common law for the death of another or for any negligence causing the death of another, I refer to Osborne v. Gillett[32]. The rule is the same in the Admiralty Courts. See \u201cHall\u2019s Admiralty Practice\u201d 21, \u201cDunlop\u2019s Admiralty Practice\u201d 87, \u201cBenedict\u2019s Admiralty Practice\u201d 185, and \u201cParson\u2019s Ship and Admiralty\u201d 350. Then the child in this case was under the age of fourteen years, and it is a presumption that a child under fourteen is incapable of earning anything or of being a servant. The mother therefore, if otherwise entitled to sue, could not maintain an action against a person whose wrongful act had caused the death of the child, because the child was not old enough to be capable of rendering any act of service, or to be treated by the law as a servant, in other words because it would be a presumption of law that the mother could not have sustained any such, injury as, under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, would entitle her to damages See \u201cMacpherson on Infants,\u201d Evans v. Walton[33]; Grinell v. Wells[34]; Hall v. Hollander[35]. Then again the question does not disclose facts upon which my learned friend could be allowed to argue that there is a ground of action for loss of a servant\u2019s services. There is no allegation of the value of these services. The allegation in the petition of the expenditure of money by the mother in searching for and recovering the body of her son, is not such damages as would entitle her to maintain a suit. See Pim v. The G.N. Railway Co.[36]; and Dalton v. The South Eastern Railway Co.[37], and if the proceeding is sought to be maintained on the ground that the deceased being the petitioner\u2019s servant she is entitled to damage on account of the loss of services, it is clear that there is no right arising when death happens instanter as there would be in the case of a servant being injured, and so incapacitated from performing the services he had undertaken to render, but had not been killed. See Baker v. Bolton[38]; Osborne v. Gillett[39]; Hyatt v. Adams[40].\nMr. Scott in reply:\nIf the allegation in the petition as to damages resulting to plaintiff from the loss of the services of her son as servant is not sufficient, I pray for leave to amend the petition accordingly.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nNo civil action can be maintained at common law for an injury which results in death. The death of a human being, though clearly involving pecuniary loss, is not at common law the ground of an action for damages, and therefore until the passing of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, 9 and 10 Vic., c. 93, there was in England no right of action for the recovery of damages in respect of an injury causing death nor until R. Stats, c. 128 in Ontario.\nKelly, C.B., in Osborne v. Gillett[41], an action by a father against defendant for negligently causing death of plaintiff\u2019s daughter, whereby plaintiff lost the services of his daughter and the benefits which would otherwise have accrued to him from such services, and for expenses in conveying to his house the body of his daughter and her burial expenses, says:\u2014\nNo decision is to be found in the books from the earliest times by which an action for this cause has been sustained. No dictum is to be found by any judge or upon any competent authority, that such an action is maintainable, All the authority that exists is against it.\nAnd Lord Campbell\u2019s Act expressly recites that\nNo action at law is now maintainable against a person, who by his wrongful act, neglect or default, may have caused the death of another person.\nAnd\nThat it is oftentimes right and expedient that the wrong-doer in such cases shall be answerable in damages for the injury so caused by him.\nAnd in Ins. Co. v. Browne[42] Hunt, J., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\u2014\nThe authorities are so numerous and so uniform to the proposition that by the common law no civil action lies for an injury which results in death, that it is impossible to speak of it as a proposition open to question. It has been decided in many cases in the English courts, and in many of the State courts, and no deliberate well considered decision to the contrary is to be found.\nIn Hilliard on Torts[43] the rule is thus laid down:\u2014\nUpon a similar ground it has been held that at common law the death of a human being, though clearly involving a pecuniary loss, is not the ground of an action for damages.\nShearman and Redfield on Negligence,[44] says:\u2014 The common law allowed of no remedy, by way of a civil action, for the death of a human being. [A private criminal action was allowed in cases of murder. The last instance of the kind was the famous case of Ashford v. Thornton, 1 B. & Ald. 405, in which defendant insisted upon his right to trial by battle. The right of action was soon after taken away by statute.] Obviously, the deceased person never would have had a cause of action for his own death; therefore none could survive to his legal representatives, even if the law had allowed, as in fact it did not allow, a cause of action for an injury to the person to survive him. The husband or master of the deceased was not allowed to sue, because the only damage recognized by the law was the loss of service during the lifetime of the servant, and the death of the servant, therefore, worked no injury to the master of which the law could take notice. And, if the act causing death amounted to a felony, the general rule of the common law, forbidding any civil suit upon a felony, would alone have sufficed to exclude a claim for damages. Whatever may be said of the logic of these arguments, it is certain that the conclusions thus reached formed a settled doctrine of the common law. No one, whether as executor, master, parent, husband, wife or child, or in any other right or capacity whatsoever, could maintain an action for damages on account of the death of a human being. The earliest reported decision upon this point was in an action for the battery of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, \u201cwhereby she died.\u201d It was held that the right of action was merged in the felony, Higgins v. Butcher, Yelv. 89, 1 Bro. & Gold., 205. The first reported case of negligence in which the question arose was before Lord Ellenborough (Baker v. Bolton, 1 Camp. 493) who instructed the jury that the plaintiff, who sued for the loss of his wife\u2019s services, could only recover for his loss during her lifetime, although her death was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. All the decisions in cases where an executor or administrator sought to maintain the action have been one way. But an attempt was made to distinguish between this claim and the claim for loss of service, which seems to have been successful in two instances, one an action brought by a father for the loss of his son, and the other brought by a husband for the loss of his wife. But in these cases the legal question does not appear to have been argued; and in well-considered cases it has been uniformly and unanimously adjudged that a husband cannot sue for the death of his wife, nor a wife for the loss of her husband, nor a master for the death of his servant. Neither can any one maintain an action for any indirect loss which he sustains by the death of another person; such, for example, as the loss which an insurer of the life sustains by that event. If an action such as this ought to be maintainable at common law, as Bramwell, B., so strongly urges in his dissenting judgment in Osborne v. Gillett[45], the long established principle that the death of any human being cannot be complained of as an actionable injury must be changed by the legislature, and the provisions of the Ontario Revised Statutes, ch. 128, founded on the principle of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act[46], must be extended by the legislature, and not by the courts, to meet a case of this kind.\nI do not think it necessary to discuss or determine the question, on which such a contrariety of judicial opinion exists in England, as to whether the admiralty has jurisdiction in rem in a case in which the right of action is under the 9th and 10th Vic., ch. 93; but, assuming that an action given by the 9th and 10th Vic., ch. 93, is within the words and meaning of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, and that the action given by the Rev. Stats. Ont.[47], is within the words and meaning of the Ontario Maritime Court Act[48], this action cannot be maintained, because it is not brought under that act; the mother here does not sue as the personal representative of her deceased son. No action is given by the statute, but to the personal representative. The words of the statute[49] are as follows:\nSec. 2\u2014Action given to recover damages for the death of any person caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default.\nSec. 3\u2014Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death has been so caused, and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased.\nSec. 5\u2014Not more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject-matter of complaint.\nBut it has been argued that though this may be so at common law, and though the Ontario statute cannot be applied to this case, nevertheless that the Court of Admiralty has jurisdiction, in a cause of damage for loss of life happening by a collision instituted against a ship; but I think this cannot be sustained. Whatever may be the rule in the United States with respect to a remedy in the admiralty, independent of statute, for a wrong or injury incurred by the death of a person, as by a parent in a proceeding in rem against the vessel, which by collision caused the death of the child, there is no such remedy, independent of statute, in the admiralty of England, and consequently none in the Maritime Court of Ontario. In The Guldfaxe[50], a suit to recover damages by the personal representative of a person killed in a collision between two vessels, Sir Robert Phillimore says:\u2014\nThough it has been suggested, and is possible, that this court (Admiralty Court) may at one time have exercised original jurisdiction in such a suit as the present, I do not think that there is sufficient evidence to be derived from the records of the court, or from other sources, to warrant me in pronouncing in favor of the jurisdiction of the court upon this ground. If the court be competent to entertain this suit, it must have derived such competence from statute law. The counsel for the plaintiff have mainly\u2014I might almost say exclusively\u2014relied upon certain recent statutes as having conferred this jurisdiction upon the court.\nThe learned Judge then proceeds to examine \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act,\u201d and of it says:\u2014\nThe effect of this statute then was to give a new right previously unknown to the common law; according to which all suits founded on a personal injury or tort died with the person. * * *\nThis statute though it effected the material alteration in the common law which I have mentioned, conferred no jurisdiction upon the Admiralty Court.\nHe then considers the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, and finally concludes, although not without doubt, that the court had jurisdiction, under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, to entertain the suit.\nI think this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nL\u2019appelante E.J.

Elle y a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un conflit de d\u00e9cisions entre la Haute Cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 qui a maintenu sa juridiction, et la Cour du Banc de la Reine, de l\u2019autre, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, d\u00e9cidant le contraire. Les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es dans le factum de l\u2019appelant, sont discut\u00e9es dans la cause du \u201cFranconia\u201d[51] Sir Robert Phillimore les passe en revue en ces termes:\nIn the case of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d[52], decided in 1867, I ruled, and allowing the opinion of Dr. Lushington, that the Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction under the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, to entertain a cause for personal damage done by a ship, and I stated my reasons. This judgment was not appealed from. In the following year, 1868, I again had occasion to consider the question, and stated my reasons at length for considering that the same Court had jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the recovery of damages by the personal representative of a person killed in a collision between two vessels.\nIn 1869, in the case of \u201cThe Beta\u201d[53], I again held that this Court had jurisdiction in a cause of damage instituted against a ship for personal damage. From this judgment an appeal was prosecuted to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1869, and that Court consisting of Lord Romilly, Sir W. Erle, Sir James Colville and Sir Joseph Napier, said: \u201cThe words of the 7th section of the Admiralty Court Jurisdiction Act, 1861, which had been referred to, clearly include every possible kind of damage. Personal injuries are undoubtedly within the words \u201cdamage done by any ship.\u201d The case of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d which has been referred to, and in which it was so held, has not been appealed from.\u201d In 1870, in the case of \u201cThe Explorer\u201d[54] I entertained a suit brought against a foreign ship by the personal representative of persons killed in a collision. There was, I believe, an appeal to the Privy Council, but it was never prosecuted; and if the cases on this subject ended here, I should have no difficulty in reaffirming the principle laid down by Dr. Lushington, myself and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. But in the case of \u201cThe Black Swan,\u201d in 1871, where injury and death had been caused by a collision at sea and the suit had been entertained by this Court, an application was made to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for a prohibition, which was granted: Smith v. Brown[55]. I need not say that to such a Court, it is my inclination, as well as my duty, to pay the highest possible respect; but the unfortunate conflict between the judgment pronounced when the prohibition was granted and the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of \u201cThe Beta,\u201d compels me to consider the circumstances attending the proceedings before the learned judges of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and the grounds upon which their decision was founded. The case was heard before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, Mr. Justice Hannen and Mr. Justice Blackburn. The latter learned judge said: \u201cI have entertained doubts in this case, not altogether removed, but which are not strong enough to make me dissent from this judgment, or even to make me require further time for consideration.\u201d The Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Hannen considered the question \u201cone of considerable difficulty,\u201d but decided in favour of the prohibition.\nIt appears to me that the main ground, I will not say the ratio decidendi of the Lord Chief Justice\u2019s judgment, was that the word \u201cdamage\u201d was used as applicable to mischief done to property, and not to injuries done to the person; and his Lordship said: \u201cAnd that this distinction is not a matter of mere verbal criticism, but is of a substantial character and necessary to be attended to is apparent from the fact that the legislature in two recent acts in pari materi\u00e2 both having reference to the liability of ship owners in respect of injury or damage, namely, the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854[56] and the Merchant Shipping Act Amendment Act, 1862[57], has, in a series of sections, carefully observed this distinctive phraseology, speaking in distinct terms, in the same section, of loss of life and personal injury on the one hand, and loss and damage done to ship\u2019s goods or other property on the other. In those acts the term \u201cdamage\u201d is nowhere used as applicable to injuries done to the person; it is applied only to property and inanimate things. We see no reason to suppose that the Legislature, in using the term in the enactment we are considering, had lost sight of the distinction uniformly observed in the preceding statutes.\u201d\nTel est actuellement l\u2019\u00e9tat de la jurisprudence en Angleterre sur cette importante question. Comme on le voit par la citation ci-dessus, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn se range \u00e0 l\u2019opinion contraire en donnant pour raison que le mot damage ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux dommages faits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et non \u00e0 ceux faits \u00e0 la personne. Toutefois, cette signification limit\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par le Conseil priv\u00e9,\nLa position prise sur cette question par la Haute Cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9, confirm\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision \u00e9gale de la Cour d\u2019Appel, a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par le jugement unanime du comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil priv\u00e9, dans la cause du Beta[58]. La Cour du Banc de la Reine, comme on l\u2019a vu dans la citation donn\u00e9e plus haut, avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire. Le principal motif de sa d\u00e9cision fut que la juridiction de la Cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux dommages faits \u00e0 la personne \u201cdoes not ettend to personal injuries\u201d\u2014que le terme \u201cdommage\u201d employ\u00e9 dans la section 7 n\u2019a rapport qu\u2019au dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette interpr\u00e9tation ne fut pas admise par l\u2019honorable Conseil Priv\u00e9. L\u2019appel \u00e9tait d\u2019un jugement de la Haute Cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle avait juridiction dans une poursuite intent\u00e9e contre un b\u00e2timent pour dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne. Lord Romilly en pronon\u00e7ant le jugement au nom de la Cour s\u2019exprima ainsi60:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the order appealed from ought to be affirmed. The words of the 7th section of the Admiralty Court Jurisdiction Act, which had been referred to, clearly include every possible kind of \u201cdamage done by any ship.\u201d The case of \u201cThe Sylph,\u201d which has been referred to, and in which it was so held, has not been appealed from. There was every reason for the legislature enacting that which the judment of the Court below holds to have been enacted. Their Lordships will humbly recommend Her Majesty to affirm the judgment of the Court below with costs.\nPuisqu\u2019il y a conflit d\u2019opinion dans les plus hautes cours en Angleterre sur cette question, le jugement de l\u2019honorable Conseil Priv\u00e9, qui est la cour de dernier ressort pour notre pays, doit dans ce cas faire la loi pour nous. C\u2019est par ce haut tribunal que notre d\u00e9cision dans cette cause serait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre reform\u00e9e, si les parties en appelaient, et non \u00e0 aucune autre cour d\u2019Angleterre, quelque digne de respect que soit d\u2019ailleurs ses d\u00e9cisions.\nL\u2019honorable juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 toute pr\u00e9tention admise par le Conseil priv\u00e9. Il a cru voir entre les deux textes donnant juridiction sur cette mati\u00e8re \u00e0 la Haute-Cour et \u00e0 la cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence suffisante pour faire admettre cette juridiction dans la premi\u00e8re et la rejeter dans la seconde. Il attache une grande importance au mot any, (any claim), qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de le mot claim dans l\u2019acte de 1861 et qui ne se rencontre pas dans celui de 1863, concernant la cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9. Ce dernier acte dit au lieu de \u201cany claim\u201d \u201cclaims for damage done by any ship.\u201d L\u2019omission du mot any dans cette phrase est absolument sans importance. Les deux phrases signifient exactement la m\u00eame chose,\u2014toutes deux disent d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et sans restriction aucune, que les r\u00e9clamations pour dommages seront de la juridiction des deux cours d\u2019amiraut\u00e9. Dans toute la discussion qui a eu lieu sur la question qui nous occupe, on ne voit nulle part qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9 la moindre importance \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de r\u00e9daction des deux actes. Ce qui a divis\u00e9 les tribunaux, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la signification \u00e0 donner au mot \u201cdommage.\u201d Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, avec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne devait s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019aux dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et non \u00e0 la personne. La cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 et la Cour d\u2019Appel divis\u00e9e \u00e9galement et l\u2019hon. Conseil Priv\u00e9 ont au contraire maintenu que le mot \u201cdommage\u201d \u00e9tait assez g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour comprendre aussi bien les dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que ceux faits \u00e0 la personne. Dans la cause du \u201cBeta\u201d il est vrai que l\u2019accident n\u2019avait pas caus\u00e9 la mort, mais je crois que s\u2019il se f\u00fbt agi de dommages r\u00e9sultant de la mort, l\u2019honorable Conseil Priv\u00e9 aurait encore fait, avec plus de raison, le m\u00eame argument au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du mot dommage. N\u2019admettant aucune diff\u00e9rence dans les deux textes dont il s\u2019agit, je pense que l\u2019on doit en conclure que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, au sujet de la comp\u00e9tence de la Haute-Cour d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9, l\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement par rapport \u00e0 la Cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9, car dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas il ne se serait agi que de la signification \u00e0 donner au mot \u201cdommage.\u201d La Cour Maritime d\u2019Ontario ayant la m\u00eame juridiction que la Cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9 d\u2019Angleterre, j\u2019en conclus qu\u2019elle a, comme cette derni\u00e8re, juridiction pour d\u00e9cider sur la r\u00e9clamation dont il s\u2019agit.\nUne autre objection faite \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande, c\u2019est que l\u2019appelante aurait d\u00fb poursuivre en vertu de l\u2019acte de Lord Campbell (9 et 10 Vict., ch. 93, 1846) comme administratrice de la succession de son fils et non comme sa m\u00e8re, seule qualit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a prise dans la proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019honorable juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas exprim\u00e9 d\u2019opinion sur ce point. Etant d\u2019avis que la cour n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour juger la question principale, il \u00e9tait tout\u2011\u00e0\u2011fait inutile pour lui de se prononcer sur cette question. Mais \u00e9tant d\u2019une opinion contraire \u00e0 la sienne sur la juridiction de la Cour Maritime, et pensant que les conclusions de la demande devraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es, si elles sont plus tard justifi\u00e9es par la preuve, il devient important de savoir si l\u2019appelante a qualit\u00e9 pour porter sa pr\u00e9sente demande.\nJe dois d\u2019abord dire en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette objection que l\u2019on ne peut tirer contre l\u2019appelante aucun argument de l\u2019acte de Lord Campbell. La proc\u00e9dure n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur cet acte, mais bien seulement sur l\u2019acte donnant, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 ci-dessus, juridiction \u00e0 la Cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9 en pareille mati\u00e8re. La juridiction qu\u2019elle a sur ce sujet ne lui vient pas de l\u2019acte de Lord Campbell. Ceci est \u00e9vident par les dispositions de cet acte, qui donne au jury le pouvoir de r\u00e9partir le montant des dommages entre les diverses parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans la poursuite en dommage dans le cas de mort caus\u00e9e par faute ou n\u00e9gligence. La Cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pu faire cette r\u00e9partition, parce qu\u2019alors elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir, qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 depuis, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un jury certaines questions de fait. Cons\u00e9quemment une action en vertu de l\u2019acte de Lord Campbell n\u2019y pouvait pas \u00eatre port\u00e9e. C\u2019est, sans doute, pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette omission, que plus tard la juridiction lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme on l\u2019a vu plus haut. Comme il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de poursuivre en vertu de l\u2019acte de Lord Campbell, il n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de le faire dans la forme indiqu\u00e9e par cet acte, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au nom de l\u2019administrateur de la succession du d\u00e9funt. Mais faut-il au moins que l\u2019appelante ait une qualit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale pour repr\u00e9senter la succession de son fils. Celle de m\u00e8re du d\u00e9funt qu\u2019elle a prise est-elle suffisante en loi? Je me dispenserai de discuter cette question si importante qu\u2019elle soit, car je trouve sur ce sujet une dissertation dans le 12me vol. du \u201cCentral Law Journal\u201d[59], qu\u2019il suffit de citer. L\u2019article dont le titre est ainsi: \u201cWas death by wrongful act, default or negligence actionable at common law? If so, by whom could the action be brought,\u201d discute deux questions: celle de savoir si l\u2019action existait d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi commune,\u2014et qui avait qualit\u00e9 pour la porter. C\u2019est \u00e0 la partie traitant cette derni\u00e8re question que je r\u00e9f\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement. La question y est discut\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s savante, et la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en arrive l\u2019auteur est fond\u00e9e sur les plus hautes autorit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales. Je n\u2019en citerai que la conclusion:\u2014 Death by wrongful act, or negligence, was actionable at common law, as the law stood in the year 1738, when Blackstone delivered his lectures, and the right of action was in favor of the wife and heir at law, or any others having an interest in the life of the person killed.\nJe dois ajouter que je donne mon enti\u00e8re approbation aux vues exprim\u00e9es par mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, le juge Taschereau, dans la savante dissertation qu\u2019il a faite sur cette m\u00eame question. Je crois aussi qu\u2019il a \u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus certaine l\u2019existence du droit d\u2019action du ma\u00eetre pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages contre celui qui, par sa faute ou n\u00e9gligence, a caus\u00e9 la mort de son serviteur. La r\u00e9clamation en cette cause, il est vrai, n\u2019est pas faite par la Demanderesse en qualit\u00e9 de ma\u00eetresse pour recouvrer la valeur des services de son enfant comme serviteur; mais comme en pareil cas les actions sont ordinairement port\u00e9es dans cette forme, la d\u00e9claration en cette cause pourrait \u00eatre amend\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 soulever la question de responsabilit\u00e9 dans cette forme.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis que la Cour Maritime d\u2019Ontario a juridiction pour entretenir la pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9clamation et que l\u2019Appelante a qualit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale pour porter la dite demande.\nHENRY, J.:\nTo some extent I am reluctantly compelled to arrive at the conclusion that the appellant here is not entitled to the process of the Admiralty Court in the mode adopted. I have satisfied myself that the court has not jurisdiction in the matter, and that the plaintiff was precluded from bringing an action for personal damages. The powers conferred on the Vice-Admiralty Court are by the statute conferred upon the Maritime Court of Ontario. I think the appellant would have been entitled to our judgment had the suit been brought so as to have brought the plaintiff within the position pointed to in the Ontario Statues[60], which is a copy of Lord Campbell\u2019s act, giving the representatives of the deceased party the right to bring an action for damages. I think the court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, but I fail to see, nor have I been able to find, any authority for sustaining the action in the Vice-Admiralty Court on the part of a mere friend or relation of the party who was killed. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI can see no difference between the Admiralty Act of 1851 and the Vice-Admiralty Act of 1863, and, in my opinion, if the High Court of Admiralty has jurisdiction over all claims in respect of damage done by any ship, whether to person or to property, the Vice-Admiralty Courts, and consequently the Maritime Court of Ontario, have the same jurisdiction. I concur fully in what my brother Gwynne says on this part of the case.\nNow, has the Admiralty Court such jurisdiction? Upon this point I consider myself bound by the decision of the Privy Council in the \u201cBeta\u201d case[61]. Independently of that decision, were I called to interpret for the first time the Admiralty Act of 1861, or the Vice Admiralty Act of 1863, I would read them both as giving jurisdiction over \u201cclaims for\u201d any \u201cdamage done by any ship,\u201d whatever may be the nature of the damage, and whether to person or to property.\nOne of the reasons given by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in Smith v. Brown[62], why no action at all for personal injuries should be entertained by the Admiralty Courts, is, that as in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and the Merchant Shipping Act amendment act of 1862, the term \u201cdamage\u201d is nowhere used as applicable to injuries done to the person, it must be presumed that, in the Admiralty Court Act, the same term \u201cdamage\u201d is used in the same sense, and likewise applies only to mischief done to property, and not to injuries done to the person.\nSir Robert Phillimore in the \u201cFranconia\u201d case[63] has fully answered that objection. I will merely observe that the Admiralty Court Act in question was passed in 1861, so that the Merchant Shipping Act amendment act of 1862 did not precede it. Then as to the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854[64], it plainly, as I read it, provides for the case where the owner of a ship may be answerable in damage for loss of life or personal injury. It enacts that no owner of any seagoing ship shall be answerable in damages to an extent beyond the value of his ship, in case where any loss of life or personal injury is, by reason of the improper navigation of such ship, caused to any person carried in any other ship, without the actual fault and privity of such owner. Does not this enactment recognize that damages for loss of life and personal injuries may, in certain cases, be recoverable from the owner? So that, in this enactment, the word \u201cdamages\u201d clearly applying to loss of life and personal injury, the same word must receive the same application in the interpretation of the Admiralty Court Act of 1861, and consequently of the Vice-Admiralty Court Act of 1863, if comparison between these acts is to be considered as a criterion on the interpretation of the said word \u201cdamage.\u201d\nOn this question; whether the admiralty courts have jurisdiction over actions for personal injuries, I observe that one of Mr. Justice Bramwell\u2019s grounds of reasoning in \u201cThe Franconia\u201d case, against the jurisdiction of the said court, in actions under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, is that as under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act the damages are to be necessarily assessed by a jury, and as a jury cannot be had in the admiralty court, it is evident that the admiralty court cannot entertain such cases. A word will, suffice to show that this argument cannot any how be invoked in Ontario, and it is this: Ch. 128 of the Revised Statutes (Ontario) distinctly enacts that, in such actions, the damages are to be assessed by the jury or by the judge. It is clear, then, that whatever force that argument may have had in \u201cThe Franconia\u201d case, it could not avail in Ontario. Then, another reason why it cannot apply to the present case, is that the present action is not brought under our re-enactment of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. I have a further observation to make as to this \u201cFranconia\u201d case. The Admiralty Court there held, in first instance, that it had jurisdiction in an action for personal injuries under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. In the Appeal Court the judges being equally divided, the decision of the Admiralty Court was affirmed. In re The Attorney General v. Dean of Windsor[65], it was held by Lord Campbell, that when there is an equal division of opinion among the Lords, and in consequence the judgment of the court below stands, the result is the same, as to the authority, as if the Lords had been unanimous in their judgment. On this principle, the holding of the Admiralty Court in \u201cThe Franconia\u201d case, that it has jurisdiction in an action in rem for personal injuries, should, be considered as to authority, as unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. This principle may, however, not be applicable to the Court of Appeal, but I do not deem it necessary for me to con-consider this point here, or to dwell any longer on this part of the case, as I think myself bound, as I have already stated, by the decision of the Privy Council on this question in the \u201cBeta\u201d case. I will merely add that, to shut the door of the Admiralty Court to those who are personally injured by any ship, is obviously to deny them the right of proceeding in rem against such ship. Now, it must be evident that this, in a great many cases, is virtually to deprive the sufferers of all remedy or redress whatsoever. It seems to me that this consideration gathers special weight for us from the circumstances of the geographical position of our country. Divided territorially as we are, for hundreds of miles, from the United States, by a now imaginary line across the water, it is evident that, as by moving a very short distance only, ships on our inland waters can go from this country to the United States, and from the United States to this country, the owners, if their ships are not subject to proceedings in rem are in a position, in the event of their causing loss of life or personal injury, to easily rid themselves, in a great many cases, of the consequences of their wrong doings.\nThe other and most important question in this case, and one which, I need not say, causes me the greatest embarrassment, and which I approach with great diffidence, is whether, according to the common law of England\u2014for the present suit is not under any statute similar to Lord Campbell\u2019s Act\u2014an action lies, at the suit of the mother of a child killed by negligence, to recover damages against the party whose negligence caused the death, in the character of mistress for the loss of her servant; this being, it is admitted, the form of action allowed and usually resorted to by a parent, to recover damages in such cases[66]; and the plaintiff\u2019s declaration to be amended, if necessary, to fully cover this ground.\nIt is a matter of special regret for me, I need hardly remark, that, as this case comes before us, not only are we deprived of the advantage of having, on a question of this importance, and to me, so difficult of solution, the most valuable aid of the always so well-considered judgments of the learned judges of the superior courts of Ontario, but that even the Maritime Court itself, from which this appeal is brought directly to this court, has not examined and determined the question it is now my duty to consider, having disposed of the case on other grounds. The assistance that is afforded by the discussion of the same point in Osborne v. Gillett[67] by learned and eminent judges in England, is, under these circumstances, of an obviously increased value to me. The majority of the court in that case held, Baron Bramwell dissenting, that a master cannot maintain an action for the immediate death of his servant. If this decision was binding upon this court, I would, of course, have to follow it, and the discussion would be at an end. But as it is clearly not so, and the matter is for us res integra, I must say that, in my opinion, the weight of reasoning and logic is entirely with Baron Bramwell, the dissenting judge in that case.\nI will not venture to try and add anything to what that learned judge has said as to Baker v. Bolton[68], and the other cases relied upon by the majority of the court in that case of Osborne v. Gillett. It would be presumptuous on my part to do so. Neither do I think it necessary to notice the cases cited, inter alia, by the defendant, of \u201cThe Halley\u201d[69], and the \u201cM. Moxham\u201d[70], wherein questions as to the application of foreign law, in certain cases, have been raised and determined, more than to say, that they have here no application, as no such questions of foreign law have to be considered in the present case, the only point in controversy and argued before us being whether or not, under our own law, the plaintiff\u2019s action lies. As to Glaholm v. Barker[71] and some cases from the Admiralty Court, cited by the defendant, and, I believe, relied upon by my brother Gwynne, they certainly contain various obiter dicta to the effect that no action lies at common law for damages arising from the wrongful killing of any one, but it is evident that these cases are not directly in point. In every one of them, that no such action lies is taken for granted, but not decided. The same may be said of the judgments in \u201cThe Franconia\u201d case, I have already referred to. In none of these cases was the point, as between master and servant, directly in issue, or necessarily determined for the solution of the litigation between the parties.\nI may also remark that Mr. Justice Bramwell, in the \u201cFranconia\u201d case, did not, in any way, as contended before us, show any tendency to recede from the position he had taken upon this question, in Osborn v. Gillett. In the \u201cFranconia\u201d case, he was of opinion that the Admiralty Court has no jurisdiction in rem in a cause for damages under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act; in Osborne v. Gillett he held that a master can maintain an action against the wrong-doer before the ordinary civil courts for damages resulting from wrongful killing of his servant, even when the death of the servant is immediate. There is no conflict in these two opinions of the learned judge. Baggally and James, L.JJ., in this \u201cFranconia\u201d case, answer fully the objection taken in Smith v. Brown[72] against the right of action in the Admiralty Court, on the difference between the common law rule and the admiralty rule on contributory negligence. I may add that in the \u201cGeorge\u201d and \u201cRichard\u201d[73] it was admitted by counsel on both sides, and accepted as law by the court, that the rule of the common law must supersede the admiralty rule, even in the admiralty courts, in actions for loss of life under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. In cases of collision the admiralty rule, since the Judicature Act of 1873 is, it is true, in England, followed in the common law as well as in the admiralty courts[74], and this is now so, for us, in virtue of 43 Vic., ch. 29, sec. 8(D), but this probably would not apply to actions under Lord Campbell\u2019s or similar acts, or to any actions whatsoever for loss of life or for personal injury.\nIt is argued that Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and our corresponding statutes contain a legislative declaration that, according to the common law of England or of this country, no action is maintainable against a person, who, by his wrongful acts, may have caused the death of another person. Mr. Justice Bramwell answers that argument in Osborne v. Gillett. It seems clear by the titles, recitals and the context of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, and our Canadian re\u2011enactment of it, 10 & 11 Vic., ch. 6, consolidated by ch. 78, C.S.C., and for Ontario now contained in ch. 128 Rev. Stat., that the legislature, by these statutes, intended nothing else than to provide for the families of persons killed by negligence, and to legislate only as to the damages suffered by their families The relation of master and servant cannot, it seems to me, be affected by these acts, or the declaration they contain as to the previous state of the law, even if those of father and child, &c., were so affected by this declaration. Moreover, if our Act 10 & 11 Vic., ch. 6, was held to declare that previous to its enactment no action was given in any case for the death of any one, it would be holding it to declare what would have been, and would be, a most flagrant untruth, as to Lower Canada at least, to which this statute applied as well as to Upper Canada; for under the French civil law an action unquestionably lies, and always did lie, by a parent for the wrongful killing of his child) or by the child for the wrongful killing of his parent.\nThen, if this declaration in Lord Campbell\u2019s act and our re-enactment of it, could at all be relied upon in support of the defendant\u2019s contention, an argument of the same nature, against it, can be based on a declaration contained in another of our statutes. By the 43 Vic. ch. 29 (D) sec. 13 (a re-enactment of 31 Vic. ch. 58, sec. 12 (D), in force at the time of the collision in question, it is enacted that the owners of any ship shall not, where any loss of life occurs through the negligence of those in charge of such ship, or by reason of the improper navigation of such ship, without the actual fault or privity of the said owners, be answerable in damages for such loss of life to an amount exceeding $38.92 for each ton of the ship\u2019s tonnage. This act applies whether the collision occurs in British or foreign waters, or on the high seas[75]. The liability in damages, for loss of life, of the owner of a ship is thus, in this enactment, clearly recognized. Now, this said enactment extends to all the Dominion, and to every province thereof. In those of the provinces, like Ontario and Quebec, where statutes similar to Lord Campbell\u2019s act are in force, this recognition of liability for loss of life, it may fairly be argued, must be construed as applying simply to actions brought under these statutes. But in those of the provinces where there are no statutes similar to Lord Campbell\u2019s Act (in Nova Scotia for instance), and for which, as well as for the other provinces, this Dominion statute provides for the case of damages due by the owner of a ship for loss of life caused by his negligence or the negligence of those in charge of his said ship, is not this provision of the said statute equivalent to a declaration by the legislative authority, that, at common law, an action does lie for loss of life in certain cases?\u2014this declaration to be necessarily construed as applying only to the subject of navigation and shipping over which the Dominion parliament has jurisdiction? Otherwise, causing loss of life by improper navigation would be actionable in Ontario and Quebec, and not actionable in Nova Scotia, though the Dominion statute was passed to render the rule in this respect uniform all through the Dominion. However, as this point has not been taken at the argument, I will not dwell any longer upon it.\nI now come to the consideration of the main ground, upon which is based the contention that an action by the master, for the wrongful killing of his servant, is not maintainable where the death of the servant was immediate.\nActio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2, it is argued, and consequently the master\u2019s action for damages in such a case is gone. This, in my opinion, is entirely a misapplication of the maxim.\nWhat action dies with the person? Clearly the action of the one who dies. Well the one who died never had an action for being killed. The action that, according to the maxim, died with the deceased is the action he, the deceased, had for the injuries, if any, he suffered in his lifetime. But the present plaintiff\u2019s action is not at all for injuries and damages caused to her deceased son, but purely and simply for injuries and damages caused to herself, the plaintiff. These injuries and damages she complains of and claims in the present action did obviously not exist when her son was living; her right to the present action had not accrued, and could not accrue when and as long as he lived. How then can it be contended that her right of action died with him? How could her action die before it came to existence, before it originated, before the fact that created it happened?\nIt is plain that, when the death is immediate, the maxim cannot apply, because, the deceased never had an action against the person who wrongfully caused his death. Actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 means that, if one, for instance, who has suffered damages from slander, battery, and false imprisonment, etc., etc, etc., dies before instituting an action for these damages, the right of action dies with him, his representatives will not have, in such cases, the action which in his lifetime belonged to him, for damages to his person, and which he did not care or refused to bring\u2014that is all that the maxim says. It is true that it has sometimes been made to also apply to the defendant, and to mean that, if one who is answerable in damages, say, for a battery, for instance, dies before an action is instituted against him, the action for such damages is not then maintainable against his representatives. Nox\u2019s Maxims, 9th ed. 20; 1, Williams v. Saunders 239; note a to Wheatley v. Lane, (edition of 1871); Bird v. Ralph[76]; Canterbury v. Atty. Genl.[77] But this principle is not derived from the maxim. Actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 applies only to the party who had the action, to the party who would have been plaintiff if he had lived. It does not apply to the deceased wrong-doer, against whom the action would have been taken. In other words, it is the actio personalis, the action for injuries to the person itself, not the actio in personam, that dies with the person. A contrary interpretation would have the maxim say that all personal as distinguished from real actions die with the person, which would be an absurdity.\nI may here observe that in Potler v. Metropolitan Dis- trict Ry. Co.[78]; affirmed by the Exchequer Chamber[79]; and in Bradshaw v. The Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co.[80]; it was held that damages suffered by the personal estate of a deceased person, arising from breach, of contract, can be recovered after his death by his personal representatives, though there was previously no instance of any such action ever having been brought. In this last case, the deceased had died in consequence of injuries received whilst a passenger on a railway, and the plaintiff was suing the railway company in an action for breach of contract, claiming the damage to the personal estate of the deceased arising in his lifetime from medical expenses and loss occasioned by his inability to attend business in the interval between the accident to him and his death. The court held that the maxim actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 did not apply, though death had resulted from the injuries complained of. There, the plaintiff claimed, not the damages caused to the person of the deceased, but the damage caused to the personal estate of the deceased before he died, and the claim for which formed part of his succession. Here the plaintiff claims, not the damages caused to the person of her deceased son, but the damages caused to herself. These two cases differ in this, that here the plaintiff claims damages done to her own personal estate, whilst in the other case, the plaintiff claimed damages done to the personal estate of the deceased, but they are similar in this, that in both the maxim actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 is inapplicable, for the reason that, in both, the damages claimed are not damages to the person, or, in other words, that in both the action is not actio personalis in the sense of the maxim.\nThe doctrine contended for by the defendant seems to me, moreover, anomalous and unjust. A widow, for instance, has a minor son who is her only support. A physician, whom she has called to attend him for a slight indisposition, gives him a violent and deadly poison instead of a soothing draught. He dies on the spot, and she is deprived, by the gross negligence of this physician, of the only support for existence she had in this world. That she suffers damages by the loss of her son\u2019s services till at least he would have been of age, is undeniable. That this physician is the author of these damages is also clear. That these are her damages, not her deceased son\u2019s damages, is as clear. Yet, says the defendant, \u201cthis mother would have no action against the physician.\u201d And why? because he killed her son instead of disabling him only, or only rendering him ill, say, for a month. \u201cBut, just because he killed my son\u201d (would think this mother) \u201cI am entitled to heavier damages.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says the defendant, \u201cthe law exonerates this physician just because he killed your son. Had he disabled him for a short space of time only, you would be entitled to damages, but as he killed him, though he must admit that you suffered damages, and that he caused you these damages, yet the law says that he is not answerable for these damages.\u201d For, a fact which must not be lost sight of is that, on this demurrer, the defendant admits that his wrongful act caused the death of the plaintiffs son, who was her servant, that the plaintiff, by this wrongful act of the defendant, lost her son\u2019s and servant\u2019s services, and that she, the plaintiff, suffered damages in consequence. Here is the admission of a wrongful act and of a damage, of a damnum cum injuri\u00e2, yet there would be, according to the defendant, no remedy, no action, no redress whatsoever. If, by his culpable negligence, this physician had sent her child to the hospital, this mother would be entitled to damages, but, as he has brought him down to his grave, her right to any redress whatever is denied. Upon what principle can this doctrine be upheld? I may here make this observation, that the law of Scotland is clear upon this point, and recognizes, under the term of assythment, the right to recover the damages caused by the wrongful killing of a person. Bell\u2019s principles of the law of Scotland[81]; Weems v. Mathieson[82]. I have already said, I believe, that under the Roman law and the French law, the action in such cases is also given.\nBut it is further argued that the immediate death of the servant cannot give a right of action to the master, because a master\u2019s claims to the services of his servant arise by contract with the servant, and that any cause therefore which terminates the contract of service must terminate the master\u2019s claim for compensation for the loss of the benefit of a contract which no longer exists. This, it seems to me, is easily answered. It is conceded, and indeed cannot be doubted, that if the child and servant, is by a wrongful act or neglect of a third party, disabled from work, but not killed, the father and master has his action for loss of service. If the child is so seriously disabled or maimed that his father is for ever deprived of his services, this would be, it is likewise conceded, an aggravation of the damages. Now, in this case also, as in the case of death, the contract or presumed contract is broken and terminated. Yet the action lies. Why then should the action not lie where it is the death of the child that terminates the contract, whilst it lies where it is a wounding or a maiming that terminates it. It is, in fact, in both cases, just because the contract is terminated that the action lies, just because the wrong-doer tortiously terminated it that he is answerable to the parent for the damages to him caused by this premature termination of it. To say that the cause which terminates the contract of service must terminate the master\u2019s or father\u2019s claim for compensation, is to say that the claim for compensation would cease before having existed, for, as I view it, it is the termination of the contract that creates the action against the wrong-doer. In other words, the termination of the contract by the wrong-doer, far from terminating the master\u2019s claim, is the origin, the cause, the sole ground of his claim and of this action.\nThen suppose that the master\u2019s ground of damages is the pre-payment of wages to his deceased servant. Could it be said that because the contract is terminated, the action is terminated? I repeat it, it is because the contract is terminated, but the action lies in such a case.\nIt is somewhere advanced as a reason why the action should be refused, in the case of immediate death, that to give it would be setting a price upon human life, or estimating its value by a pecuniary standard. But would not this reason equally apply to the action given by Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and our own corresponding statutes. Then, does not the law of insurance, for instance, allow any one, who has an interest in the life of another, to insure that life, and so to put, as it were, a premium on his death, or, in other words, convert this interest in a life to an interest in death, in the termination of that life? Moreover, in this very doctrine contended for by the defendant, is not an interest given in death? To say to the wrong-doer, that if he crushes my servant\u2019s foot he will be answerable to me in heavy damages, but that if he kills him he will escape scot free, is, it seems to me, almost inciting the wrong-doer, when he is put in the alternative, to kill my servant.\nI now pass to the consideration of the United States cases. The majority of them, it cannot be denied, support the defendant\u2019s contention, and refuse, or seem to refuse, the right of action at common law where death is immediate. There are, however, some where the right of action is admitted. In Ford v. Monroe, for instance[83], the Supreme Court of New York maintained an action by a father for the loss of the services of his child, who had been killed by the negligence of the defendant. Cross v. Guthery[84] is also cited in the same sense, but I have been unable to see the report itself. In James v. Christy[85] the Supreme Court of Missouri also held that the father whose son was killed by the negligence of the defendant, a common carrier, has an action for the damages he suffered from the loss of his son\u2019s services.\nIn Lynch v. Davis[86] Harris, J., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nThe common law gave the husband and the father a right to recover of the wrong-doer the pecuniary injury he had sustained by the reason of the killing of his wife and child.\nIn Shields v. Yonge[87] it was held that a father, whose son has been killed by negligence, has an action for the damages suffered by the loss of his child\u2019s services, if the son is old enough to render service.\nIn that case the son killed was eighteen years old. In the present case, the libel shows that the libellant\u2019s child was between thirteen and fourteen. The defendant contends that there is a presumption that a child under fourteen is incapable of earning anything, or of being a servant, and that the libellant cannot therefore be injured by his death. The answer to this, it seems to me, is that we cannot now-a-days admit such a presumption. We all know that thousands and thousands of children under fourteen, in America at least, earn good wages, and even make sometimes from four to five dollars a month or more by their industry, as for example, our newspaper boys. Moreover, this, it seems to me, will be a matter of proof. On this demurrer, the defendant admits that he, by his negligence, deprived the plaintiff of her child\u2019s services, and that thereby he caused her damage. Any presumption that the child could not render any service, if such presumption there was, must surely be taken as rebutted by the admission, on the part of the defendant, that the plaintiff, by the loss of this child\u2019s services, suffered two thousand dollars damages. Another case in point, and where the whole question is thoroughly reviewed, by one whose ability and science is universally, in this as in his own country, acknowledged. Dillon, J, In re Sullivan v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.[88] That eminent jurist there repudiated the doctrine contended for here by the defence, and held directly that where a servant is killed on the spot by the wrongful act of any one, the master may recover for the loss of service. \u201cIs it then,\u201d he says, \u201ca principle of the common law that where the death of the servant immediately ensues from the wrongful act of another, there is no remedy for the master, and that where ensues therefrom afterwards, the master\u2019s loss cannot be estimated beyond the period where the death occurred. Such a principle cannot be indicated on considerations of reason, justice or policy, and I could only consent to recognize it upon being satisfied that it was one of the rules of the common law, so long and so well settled that the courts are bound to accept it and apply it until it is changed by legislative action.\u201d The learned judge then reviews the English and American cases on this point, and shows that Lord Ellenborough, upon whose dictum, in Baker v. Bolton[89], is based the doctrine that where the death is immediate, no action lies, cites no cases, enters into no discussion, and does not profess to rest upon precedent. He then justly remarks that the majority of the court, who, in Osborne v. Gillett[90], felt bound to follow Baker v. Bolton, did not attempt to vindicate the doctrine therein enunciated, its policy, or reasonableness. The learned judge concludes by holding that a father, whose minor son has been killed by the wrongful act of another, can, in law, recover the value of his son\u2019s services from the date of his death until he would have become of age. An able note by the reporter is attached to the report.\nBut even if such an action could not be maintained at common law, the Admiralty Courts, according to some decisions, will entertain it.\nIn Cutting v. Seabury[91], Sprague, J., whom Chase, C.J., In re The Sea Gull[92], calls \u201ca very enlightened and able judge,\u201d said \u201c* * * the weight of authority in common law courts seems to be against the action, but natural equity and the general principles of law are in favour of it,\u201d and held that the Admiralty Courts would entertain such an action.\nPlummer v. Webb[93], has been cited as being in the same, but I could not lay my hands on the report.\nIn re \u201cThe Sea Gull\u201d[94], that distinguished jurist, the late Chief Justice Chase, held that the rule that personal actions die with the person is peculiar to common law, traceable to the feudal system and its forfeitures, and does not obtain in the admiralty, and that a husband can recover by a proceeding in rem against the vessel which caused the death of his wife, for the injury suffered by him thereby. The learned judge, after ob- serving that it is difficult to explain why a father may maintain an action for the loss of his son\u2019s services personally injured by the wrongful act of a third party, if the son survives, but should have no action if the son is killed on the spot, adds:\nCertainly it better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not required to withhold it by established and inflexible rules.\nI have considered carefully, amongst other cases cited by the defendant, Insurance Co. v. Browne[95], from the United States Supreme Court, a tribunal, whose decisions are always entitled to the greatest consideration. That case does not seem to me in point, though there is in the judgment of Hunt, J., a re-statement of the maxim that, at common law, actions for injuries to the person abate by death. I have already said that this means that an action for injuries and damages, for instance, to B. abates by B\u2019s death, but that this is not an action for the injuries and damages caused to B., the deceased, but purely and simply for the injuries and damages caused to A., the plaintiff, and which she the plaintiff, has suffered by B\u2019s death. In other words, the plaintiff A. does not claim the damages that B., the deceased, suffered, but damages that she, the plaintiff, suffers, and which the defendant, on this demurrer and for the purposes of this argument, admits to have, by his wrongful act, caused, not to the deceased, but to her, the plaintiff. We have been referred by the defendant to quite a number of decisions in the United States wherein, as he reads them, the doctrine he contends for here has been approved of and received as law. In not many of them can the decision be said to be directly in point, as between master and servant. It must be conceded, however, that if the cases are to be counted merely, the defendant\u2019s contention must prevail. But if, on the contrary, they are to be weighed, if we are to be guided in the determination of this question by the best established principles of justice, this doctrine appears to me utterly indefensible. I would allow the appeal, and overrule the demurrer.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis case cannot be determined upon any supposed distinction between the extent of the jurisdiction given to the High Court of Admiralty by the Imperial Statute 24 Vic. c. 10, sec. 7, and of that given to the Vice Admiralty Courts by the Imperial Statute 26 Vic. c. 24, sec. 10, sub-sec. 6.\nBy the former of those acts it is enacted that, \u201cthe High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for damage done by any ship,\u201d and by the latter that, \u201cthe matters in respect of which the Vice-Admiralty Courts shall have jurisdiction are as follows:\u201d then follow eleven subjects, all commencing with the word \u201cclaims,\u201d the sixth of which is, \u201cclaims for damage done by any ship.\u201d This form of expression comprehends when expressed in the singular number, \u201cevery claim for damage done by any ship.\u201d The only difference between the two acts is, that the former uses the singular number \u201cany claim,\u201d while the latter uses the word \u201cclaims\u201d in the plural, comprehending \u201call\u201d claims and \u201cevery claim\u201d in the singular, so that whatever jurisdiction the High Court of Admiralty has over \u201cany claim for damage done by any ship,\u201d the Vice Admiralty Courts in the British possessions have to entertain and adjudicate upon a like claim.\nIn the present case, we are not called upon to express any opinion whether, upon a question arising as to the jurisdiction of the Maritime Courts of this Dominion upon a claim for compensation for loss of life under the provisions of what is called in England Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, Imperial Statute 9 & 10 Vic. c. 93, with which the statute of Canada 10 & 11 Vic. c. 6, corresponds, we shall be governed by the decisions of the High Court of Admiralty in England in the cases of \u201cThe Guldfax,\u201d \u201cThe Explorer\u201d and \u201cThe Franconia\u201d affirmed by the judgments of Lords Justices Baggallay and James in the case of \u201cThe Franconia\u201d[96] or by the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Smith v. Brown[97], approved by the Court of Common Pleas[98], although the point did not directly arise, and by the Court of Exchequer in James v. London & South-Western Railway Co.[99], although the point did not there arise either, and by the judgments of Lord Justices Bramwell and Brett in the case of \u201cThe Franconia\u201d in the Court of Appeals, where the point did directly arise.\nThe question raised upon this record is not whether the jurisdiction of the Dominion maritime courts extends to cases of personal injuries resulting in death, within the provisions of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, for this suit is not instituted by a personal representative of the deceased, as it must be, if brought under that Act, or the corresponding Canadian Act[100].)\nThe questions raised upon this record are whether, wholly independently of the above acts, an action lies in the maritime courts of Ontario, at the suit of the mother, of a child under age killed by negligence, to recover damages against the party whose negligence caused the death, either in the character of parent for the loss of her child, or of mistress for the loss of a servant, and, if it lies in respect of the latter relationship, whether the record is so framed as to enable the petitioner to recover in respect of that relationship. But as the jurisdiction given to the maritime courts is, by the Act constituting those courts[101] stated to be, such jurisdiction\u2014\n\u201cIn all matters, including cases of contract and tort and proceedings in rem and in personam, arising out of, or connected with navigation, shipping, trade or commerce on any river, lake, canal, or inland water, of which the whole, or part, is in the province of Ontario as belongs in similar matters within the reach of its process, to any existing British Vice-Admiralty Court;\u201d the question becomes one as to what the jurisdiction of the existing British Vice-Admiralty Courts in like case would be, if the area of jurisdiction of such courts extended over the above mentioned waters.\nThe petition does not state whether the waters upon which the collision, which is alleged to have taken place, occurred, were within the limits of any of the United States of America or within the Province of Ontario, nor do the pleadings raise any question, as to there being any foreign law affecting the case, if the collision occurred within the limits of any of the United States of America; so that, in fact, the question which we have to determine is finally resolved into this, namely:\u2014whether according to the law of England, as administered in the Court of Admiralty in England, as that court was constituted before the constitution of the High Court of Justice, an action would have lain at suit of the plaintiff under the circumstances set out in the petition, in the Court of Admiralty, if the collision causing the damage had occurred within the jurisdiction of that court.\nNow the law as administered in the Court of Admiralty, as regards the point in question, is in substance the same as that which is administered in the courts of common law. There is no lex maris placing trespass to the person upon a different foundation at sea from what it has on land, or which subjects a party to damages for an injury sustained by another at sea, under circumstances which would not subject the same party to damages, if the injury had occurred on land, although as to the remedy, the party complaining of the injury has greater remedial relief by proceeding in rem where the injury is committed at sea. There is no variety in the subject matter of torts whether committed on sea or land. They cannot, like contracts, relate some to terrene and some to marine affairs. Treason, murder, battery, must be the same in their nature and their punishment, whether committed on land or water[102]. Neither is it of any importance, that in some countries where the civil law prevails, an action does lie at the suit of the widow and children for the loss of a husband or father by death caused by negligence against the party causing it, and at the suit of the husband for the loss of a wife, so killed, for the law, which is administered in the Court of Admiralty in England, is not the law simply of any foreign country. The courts admit the proof of foreign law as part of the circumstances upon which the existence of the tort, or the right to damage may depend, and then applies and enforces its own law, as far as it is applicable to the case thus established; but it is alike contrary to principle and authority to hold that an English court of justice will enforce a foreign municipal law and will give a remedy in the shape of damages in respect of an act, which, according to its own principles, imposes no liability on the person from whom the damages are claimed. This was the principle enunciated by the Privy Council in the case of \u201cThe Halley\u201d[103]; and in \u201cThe M. Moxham\u201d[104] Lord Justice Mellish, in the Court of Appeal, says:\nThe law respecting personal injuries and respecting wrongs to personal property, appears to me to be perfectly settled, but no actions can be maintained, in the courts of this country, on account of a wrongful act, either to a person or to personal property, committed within the jurisdiction of a foreign country, unless the act is wrongful by the law of the country where it is committed, and also wrongful by the law of this country.\nNeither the civil law, as administered in any foreign country, nor any other foreign law, if any such had been pleaded, could affect this case, unless such law is also adopted as part of the law of England.\nIn the case of \u201cThe Sylph\u201d[105] it was held by Sir Robt. Phillimore that the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court was so extended by 24 Vic. c. 10, sec. 7, as to give to the court jurisdiction to entertain a cause of damage for personal injuries caused to a person engaged in diving, in the river Mersey, by a steamer employed as a ferryboat on the river. The learned judge was of opinion that the court originally had jurisdiction over such a case, of which it had been deprived by 13 Ric. 2, c. 5; which enacted, \u201cthat the admirals and their deputies shall not meddle henceforth of anything done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea as it had been used in the time of Edward III.\u201d But in the case of \u201cThe Guldfaxe\u201d[106] the question of the jurisdiction of the court in the case of an injury resulting in death, first arose. That was a cause of damage on behalf of the administratrix of one of the crew of a vessel called \u201cThe Four Brothers\u201d who was killed by collision with \u201cThe Guldfax,\u201d caused, as was alleged, by the mismanagement of \u201cThe Guldfax,\u201d The contention of the counsel for the defendant was: 1st. That until the passing of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act 9 & 10 Vic., ch. 93, there was no right of action for the recovery of damages in respect of an injury causing death. Upon the part of the plaintiff it was admitted that before the passing of Lord Campbell\u2019s act the action would not have lain, but that that act gave a new right, not a new remedy. The learned Judge, Sir Robt. Phillimore, pronouncing judgment, says:\nThough it has been suggested, and is possible, that this court may at one time have exercised original jurisdiction in such a suit as the present, I do not think that there is sufficient evidence to be derived from the records of the court, or from other sources, to warrant me in pronouncing in favor of the jurisdiction of the court upon this ground. If the court be competent to entertain this suit it must have derived such competence from statute law. The counsel for the plaintiff have mainly, I might almost say exclusively, relied upon certain recent statutes as having conferred this jurisdiction upon the court, it becomes therefore necessary to examine those statutes.\nHe proceeds then to examine Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, and says:\nThe effect of this statute then, was to give a new right previously unknown to the common law.\nAnd again:\nThis statute, though it effected the material alteration in the common law, which I have mentioned, conferred no jurisdiction upon the Admiralty Court.\nHe then proceeds to examine 24 Vic., ch. 10, and other acts, and finally concludes, not without doubt and hesitation, that by the combined effect of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and the other acts, the court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The same learned judge in the case of \u201cThe Explorer\u201d[107], came to the same conclusion, and that the provisions of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act extend to a case where the person in respect of whose death damages are sought to be recovered was an alien, and was, at the time of the wrongful act, neglect or default which caused his death, on board a foreign vessel on the high seas.\nIn the case of \u201cThe Franconia\u201d[108], it was not contended that the Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction in the case of personal injury resulting in death apart from and independently of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. That Act was treated as having first created the right of action, and the question whether the action given by that statute could be entertained by the Admiralty Court under the extended jurisdiction given to it by 24th Vic., ch. 10, s. 7.\nIn the case of \u201cThe George and Richard\u201d[109], which was a suit for limitation of liability, instituted under the provisions of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act, on behalf of the owners of a brig, charged with having caused death by collision with another vessel, Sir Robt. Phillimore, giving judgment, says[110]:\u2014\nIt has been contended that the men, whose lives were lost, were guilty of negligence which contributed to the catastrophe, and therefore that their representatives cannot recover damages under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, it was not denied that if the facts shew this negligence the law is as has been stated.\nThe learned judge also held that the measure of damages recoverable was regulated by the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in Blake v. The Midland Ry. Co.[111], so that in effect, in accordance with what appears to be just and reasonable, the learned judge held that in causes of damage for injury resulting in death the same principles must be applied in the Admiralty Court as would be applied in the same case in the courts of common law, thus adopting the alternative of giving up in cases of personal injury to which the injured person himself contributed the admiralty rule as to contributory negligence, which in the subsequent case of \u201cThe Franconia\u201d was one of the objections relied upon by Lord Justice Bramwell to the Admiralty Court having jurisdiction under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, when he says:\u2014 The admiralty rule must be given up or an action be given where Lord Campbell\u2019s Act gives no action.\nIn Osborne v. Gillett[112], the Court of Exchequer, Bramwell, B, dissenting, held that no action lies at the suit of a master for injuries which cause the immediate death of the servant. It is not necessary, as it appears to me, to inquire whether or not the foundation upon which this conclusion has been rested by some is satisfactory or otherwise; the fact, as stated by Kelly, C.B., that:\nNo decision is to be found in the books from the earliest times by which an action for this cause has been sustained\u2014no dictum, is to be found, by any judge, or upon any competent authority that such an action is maintainable\u2014all the authority that exists is against it.\nis conclusive, to my mind, that no such action lies by the law of England; if, however, I entertained a different opinion, as the point which we are called upon to determine here is, what is the law of England under the circumstances in issue in Osborn v. Gillett, I should feel myself bound by the law as enunciated in that case, which is the only decision upon the point in the English courts, until the judgment rendered in that case shall be overruled by competent authority. I am sensible that I expose myself to the imputation of being presumptions when I say that (but still, with the most deferential respect for the high judicial attainments of Mr. Justice Bramwell, I must say that) there does appear to my mind good reason why, where death is instantaneous, the action should not be maintainable, and why, when death is not immediate but the injury eventually results in death, no damages should be recoverable for any portion of time subsequent to the death.\nIt has never been suggested that an action lies at the suit of one person for personal injury done to another, except upon the ground that by the injury the plaintiff was deprived of the services of the injured person, to the benefit arising from which service he was, in law, entitled; per quod servitium amisit is the very gist and sole foundation of the action. The master\u2019s claim to the services of his servant arises out of a contract with the servant, and the right to compensation for the loss of services is based upon and commensurate with the continuing existence of the contract, in virtue of which alone they are due and can be claimed. If then a servant, be injured by the tort of a third person, and can no longer render to his master the services due under the contract of service, both master and servant have their separate action for the damage accruing to each from this injury, but the measure of the master\u2019s damage is the loss of the service to which he was entitled under the contract of hiring with the servant. The contract of service still continuing, notwithstanding the injury to the servant which incapacitates him from rendering the services due thereunder, the master is entitled to compensation for the loss of such services still due; but in such a case of injury to the servant, supposing that the servant, finding himself incapable by reason of the injury received, of rendering any further service, for which damage he has a complete cause of action against the wrong-doer, declines to continue in the service of the master any longer, and in express terms puts an end to the contract of service, can it be said that the master would nevertheless still be entitled to recover damages from the person who injured the servant for loss of service during any portion of time subsequent to the servant so terminating the contract of service? The answer must clearly, in my judgment, be in the negative, and for the reason that, the contract of service being terminated, the master cannot be entitled to demand compensation for the loss of services to which he is no longer entitled. The gist of the master\u2019s action is not that the act of the wrong\u2011doer to his servant has caused the termination of the master\u2019s contract with his servant, in virtue of which contract, if not terminated, the master would have been entitled to the benefit of the services of the servant, but that the act of the wrong-doer has deprived the master of the benefit of services to which he continued to be entitled under a still existing contract with his servant, so when the death of the servant results from the injury, the contract of service and the master\u2019s claim to any future service thereunder is conclusively determined, and so all claim for damages for loss of service subsequent to the death must cease. Up to the death, if the contract still continues, the master is entitled to recover damages, but ne plus ultra. It is no answer to say, but the tort feaser, who injured the servant, has been the cause of the termination of the contract, and for such injury to the master he should render compensation, notwithstanding the death of the servant, and for a period of time subsequent to the death. In my mind, the answer to this suggestion is complete, and is, that as there is no cause of action in the master against the person who has injured the servant which the law recognizes, except for compensation for the loss of service to which in virtue of a continuing existing contract the master is entitled, when the death of the servant occurs, (no matter from what cause occurring), the contract of hiring being determined, the right of the master to all service under the contract ceases, and such right ceasing, all claim for damages for loss of service must cease also. It would be very anomalous if the same common law, which gave no cause of action to the personal representatives of the injured person to recover damages for a period subsequent to the death of the injured person, should give to a master damages for such period founded upon the claim that he had lost the benefit of the services of the deceased person to which alone he was entitled in virtue of a contract with the deceased, and which contract was in law terminated by his decease.\nThe case, then, may be said to stand thus:\u2014\nThe Admiralty Court exercises jurisdiction in cases of personal injury resulting in death under the provisions of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act; as to the right to exercise the jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal from the judgments of the Admiralty Court is divided. The majority of the common law judges who have had the matter before them, is of opinion that the Admiralty Court has not the jurisdiction which, however, it continues to exercise. All the judges of all the courts, including the judge of the Admiralty Court hold that, except in virtue of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, the Admiralty Court has no jurisdiction in a case of the nature of the present, and no such jurisdiction in such a case has ever been asserted. This action, therefore, cannot be maintained in the Maritime Courts of the Dominion by the petitioner, either in the character of mother or of mistress of the deceased.\nIn the view which I take, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the plaintiff\u2019s petition is framed upon the relationship of master and servant having been in existence. As it is only for loss of service that a master can recover in respect of an injury done to his servant, which loss must be averred and proved, Grunnell v. Wells[113] and cases ibi, it seems to be essentially necessary, and this is the invariable practice, to aver that the person injured was, at the time of the injury being received, the servant of the plaintiff. This, the petitioner in this case seems studiously to avoid doing. The petitioner preferring to rest her claim upon the relationship of parent, and although as parent, she may have been entitled to the service of her deceased child, still that was not necessarily so, for consistently with what is alleged in the petition the deceased at the time of the collision may have been de facto, the servant of another. It certainly is not averred that he was the servant of the plaintiff, and if he was not so de facto the plaintiff would have no cause of action; but this is a point of no importance, as in the case of master and servant, the action does not lie at all when the death of the servant is the immediate result of the injury. The appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs for the reasons above stated.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robinson, O\u2019Brien & Scott.\nSolicitor for respondent: Duncan Dougall.\n[1] L.R. 8 Ex. 88.\n[2] P. 464.\n[3] P. 1274.\n[4] 1 Ware 75.\n[5] Chase\u2019s Decisions 145.\n[6] Chase\u2019s Decisions 150.\n[7] 23 Int.

McD. then claimed the whole as his own, and resisted L. et al's attempt to remove them. On an action of replevin brought by L. et al for 1,440 logs cut on said lands.\nHeld, that L. et al's possession of the lands in question was sufficient to entitle them to recover in the present action against McD. who was a wrong-doer, all the logs cut on the lands in question:\nPer Strong, J.: When one party wrongfully intermingles his logs with those of another, all the party whose logs are intermingled can require is, that he should be permitted to take from the whole an equivalent in number and quality for those which he originally possessed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. This was an action of replevin (brought by the respondents in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, against appellant,) for 1,440 spruce and pine logs cut on lots 315 and 316 in the township of Horton, in the County of King's, chiefly known as the Johnston lot. The writ contained, besides the first count in replevin, two other counts in trover, but the verdict for the plaintiffs was taken only on the first count. Plaintiffs claimed and had actual possession of the land under an agreement, under seal, made in 1873, with one Moore, to whom the lots had been conveyed by deed in 1854. In 1875 having built a barn and also a camp on the land, plaintiffs commenced and continued logging all winter and cut 1,700 trees, and so also in subsequent years, In 1877 defendant, claiming title under one Benjamin, cut 500 trees on the disputed lot, and put them partly inside and partly outside of the plaintiff's boom, mixing them with some 900 logs cut by the plaintiffs in such a way that they could not be distinguished. As to Benjamin's title, it consisted in a deed dated 2nd March, 1872, by which certain parties, who had been authorized at a meeting of the inhabitants of the townships held in 1847 for the purpose of making provision for the poor, conveyed to him and others a certain tract of land situate in Horton township and known as vacant lands, containing seven thousand acres. This deed was accompanied by a power of attorney, empowering Benjamin and the other grantees, to ask, demand and receive compensation and damages from all persons liable for trespasses committed on the lot described in the deed. The defendant then claimed the whole of the logs as his own, and resisted the plaintiffs attempt to remove them, whereupon the plaintiffs took out a writ of replevin, under which they took all they could identify and enough to make up the number cut on the Johnston land and by themselves.\nThe cause was tried before the Hon. Mr. Justice DesBarres and a jury at Kentville, and resulted in a verdict for the respondents. The appellant having taken out a rule nisi to set this verdict aside, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after argument gave judgment discharging the rule nisi with costs, from which judgment the present appeal was taken.\nThe appeal was argued exparte by Mr. Rigby, Q.C., for appellant:\nThis was an action of replevin with counts in trover, and although the Judge at the trial directed a verdict to be entered on the replevin count alone, I contend this does not remedy the defect and that the jury have found on a bad writ[1]. This was taken as one of the grounds in the motion for non-suit.\nAppellant having entered upon the lands described in his deed, was in possession with color of title and had a legal right to the trees, all of which were cut upon those lands, as against the respondents, who were trespassers without right other than could be obtained by the mere act of cutting them. Washburn on Real Property[2].\nBut admitting respondents to be entitled to the trees cut by them, these only amounted to 930, whereas they replevied 1443, or over 500 that had been cut by appellant.\nThe alleged admixture by appellant of his logs with those cut by respondents, (a point taken for the first time in the judgment of the Court below) is not sufficient to justify the verdict for the following reasons:\nThe fact of the admixture or confusion was not submitted to the jury, and was not found by them, it is a question of fact, and cannot be set up by the Court as a matter of law, as it has been in this case.\nThe appellant having intermixed the logs innocently, and under a claim of right, believing that those placed within the boom by respondents had been cut upon his land and were his property, the whole quantity became the common property of the appellant and respondents, and the latter had no right to take more than their own property, i. e., 930 trees.\nIn any case, admitting that the admixture was wilful and wrongful, yet still the respondents have got 209 trees at least more than they were entitled to. They placed all that they had cut within the boom, and while appellant placed some that he had cut with these, within the boom, he also placed 209 on the landing outside the boom where they were not commingled with any logs of the respondents, but these latter were taken under the replevin and the respondents right to them confirmed by the verdict, whereas, at least as to them, there should have been a judgment de retorno habendo. Spence v. Union Marine Ins. Co.[3]; Ryder v. Hathaway[4]; Lawrie v. Rathbun, et al.[5]; Waterman on Trespass[6].\nI also submit there was evidence improperly admitted\nThe alleged plan of the township of Horton, most material evidence for respondents, upon which their whole title rested, was admitted, in the face of the objection of appellant's counsel, upon the evidence of a clerk from the Crown Land Office that he got the plan in that office where it had been since he first became a clerk there eleven years previously, and that he had been told it was the plan of Horton township. No evidence of any partition or survey was given.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThe plaintiffs were in actual possession of the property in dispute, and, neither party showing title to it, the party in possession, as against the wrong doer, was entitled to claim for trespass. In my opinion the mixing of the logs is not important in this case, it has no bearing upon the case in any way.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI think this appeal ought to be dismissed, but not for the reasons given in the judgment of the court below. The mixing by the defendant of the 500 logs cut by him with the 930 cut by the plaintiffs did not entitle the plaintiffs to replevy the whole 1,430, as held by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nThe question of title to chattels caused by one party wrongfully commingling his own property with that of another, has frequently arisen with reference to chattels of the description of those in question here, and it is well settled that all that the party whose logs are intermingled can require, is that he should be permitted to take from the whole lot an equivalent in number and quality for those which he originally possessed.\nMr. Justice Cooley thus states the results of numerous authorities on this point in Michigan:\u2014\nThis rule has been applied to the case of quantities of saw logs belonging to different parties but commingled together, and it is held that to give the party whose logs are lost the option of taking from the mass an equivalent in quantity or quality, or of demanding the value, is all that in justice he can require[7].\nFor another reason, however, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. It is apparent from the evidence that whether the true boundaries of lot 315 were or were not those contended for by the plaintiffs, they were in possession constructively of all the land claimed by them to be lot 315, upon which their own 930 logs as well as the 500 logs of the defendant were cut. The possession of the plaintiffs was not of course such possession as would be had of cultivated land, but it would have been sufficient, in the course of time, to have conferred upon them a title to this land under the Statute of Limitations, supposing they had not a title under the agreement in pursuance of which they took possession. The plaintiffs claimed the whole of this land, by the description of Lot 315, under a paper title. Therefore, when they took actual possession of part and built a barn upon it, they were, on the authorities under the Statute of Limitations, constructively in the possession of the whole. Then the defendant had not any possession, for mere occasional acts of trespass cannot constitute a possession, and he had no title, it being absurd to call that a title, which was derived from the pretended authority of the town meeting held in 1847. The consequence is that the plaintiff's possession being prim\u00e2 facie evidence of seisin in fee, the title to the logs cut by plaintiffs as well as by defendant, vested as soon as cut in the plaintiffs, who were therefore entitled to recover the whole in this action of replevin, and for that reason this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, JJ., concurred with Strong, J.:\nHENRY, J.: \u2014\nFor the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice when delivering the judgment of the court in the court below and in the charge of Mr. Justice Des Barres, before whom the issues in this case were tried, I think the respondents entitled to recover. They were in possession of the lands upon which the greater number of the logs were cut for several years under a purchase from Daniel Moore, and, for three or four or years previous had been in the sole occupation of it, and each year had cut logs on it and hauled them off it. They had also erected upon it a barn. While so in possession they cut during the winter of 1878 930 trees and hauled them out to a lake on the same land upon which they had been cut, where they placed them on the ice protected by a boom which they placed around them to prevent their being floated away when the ice should break up. Some few of the logs were marked, but the far greater number were not. Some time shortly afterwards, the appellant placed five hundred and thirteen logs, cut on the same land as those cut by the respondents, unmarked, inside the respondents boom and mixed up with those of the respondents. The respondents subsequently attempted to distinguish their logs from those of the appellant and mark them, but were prevented from doing so by the appellant's servants and the appellant claimed all the logs in the boom placed there by both parties. The respondents then commenced the present action by a writ containing the with the law as laid down by the learned Chief Justice of the court below. It is clear that the unmarked logs of the two parties in the boom could not be distinguished. The law in such a case gives the right of selection, without any account, to him whose property was originally invaded, and its distinct character destroyed (1.)\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below affirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant: Chipman & Borden.\nSolicitor for respondent: W.

M. R. the respondent's assignor. One of the branches of appellants' business was supplying merchants who were connected with the fishing business in the country, and who in return sent them fish, which was sold and the proceeds placed by appellants to credit of their customers. One S., who so dealt with appellants, in October, 1877, sent them 77 barrels of herring and 236 barrels of mackerel. On 3rd November, 1877, S. sold all the fish he had, including those mackerel, to one R. at $8 a barrel, when some were delivered, leaving 236 barrels in the appellants' store, and in payment received $4,000 and a promissory note for $4,000 at four months. This note was given to appellants by S. on account of his general indebtedness. On the 4th March, 1878, R. became insolvent and the respondent who was subquently appointed assignee, demanded the 236 barrels of mackerel and brought an action to recover the same. After issue was joined, the appellants proved against the estate of R. on the note and received a dividend on it.\nThe Chief Justice at the trial gave judgment for $1,888 less $46.10 for one month's insurance and six months' storage, and found that the appellants had knowledge that the fish sued for were included by the insolvent in the statement of his assets, and made no objection thereto known to the assignee or creditors at the meeting.\nHeld,\u2014(Strong, J., dissenting,) that the appellants having failed to prove the right of property in themselves, upon which they relied at the trial, the respondent had as against the appellants' a right to the immediate possession of the fish.\n2. That S. had not stored the fish with appellants by way of security for a debt due by him, and as the appellants had knowledge that the fish sued for were included by the insolvent in th\u00e9 statement of his assets, to which statement they made no objection, but proved against the estate for the whole amount of insolvents' note, and received a dividend thereon, they could not now claim the fish or set up a claim for lien thereon.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favor of the respondent. The action was one of trover charging the appellants (who do business under the name of Black Bros. & Co.,) with converting 250 barrels of mackerel, which were the property of William M. Richardson, the respondent's assignor. One of the branches of the appellants' business was the supplying of merchants who were connected with fishing business in the country, and they were accustomed, as others in the same line, to receive in return the fish which their customers obtained, and to sell such fish, placing the proceeds to the account of their customers. One D.N. Shaw, living in Cape Breton, so dealt with the appellants, obtaining all his supplies from them and sending them all his fish. In October, 1877, he sent to appellants 77 barrels of herring and 236 barrels of mackerel, which they placed in their store. While these fish were in their store Shaw came to Halifax, and sold the 236 barrels of mackerel along with a quantity of other fish (with which the appellants had no concern), to W. M. Richardson, who soon after became insolvent; respondent as his assignee demanded the 236 barrels of mackerel and appellants refused to deliver. On 16th March, 1878, verbal demand was made on appellants for the fish. On the 22nd March appellant sold 200 barrels of the fish to West. On the 4th April a written demand was made on the appellants for the fish. The whole amount of the sale by Shaw to Richardson was $8,101.11, of which half was paid in cash and a note was given for the other half ($4,050.56), and this note was endorsed over by Shaw to the appellants, who held it, unpaid and overdue, when the demand was made and action brought. The appellants pleaded not guilty and that the goods were not, not was any of them, the respondent's as such assignee as alleged. The action was brought 6th April, 1878, and long after issue joined, viz.: in January, 1880, appellants proved against the estate of Richardson on the note, and in February, 1880, received a dividend thereon of $577.20. The late Chief Justice tried the cause without a jury and gave judgment against the appellants for $1,841 90, on the ground that they knew Richardson had included the mackerel in his statement of assets and had not objected at the meeting of the creditors. Only one of the appellants was present at this meeting.\nMr. Thompson, Q.C., for appellants: The action in this case charging the defendants with converting 250 barrels of fish, which were the property of the plaintiffs assignor, was brought on the 6th April, 1878, and it was long after issue joined, viz.: in January, 1880, that the defendants proved against the estate of Richardson on the note and received a dividend thereon of $677.20. Now, the learned judge who tried the case gave judgment against the defendants, on the ground that they knew Richardson had included this particular fish in his statement of assets, and that they had not objected at the meeting of the creditors, but accepted a dividend on the note and declared they held no security. Only one of the defendants was present at this meeting, and having great quantities of fish in store from time to time for different persons, he could not be certain that Richardson had not any fish there until he should make enquiry. But even if the defendants had knowledge that the fish sued for were included by the insolvent in the statement of assets and made no objection thereto known to the assignee or creditors at the meeting; these facts did not entitle the plaintiff to judgment. Defendants were not bound to make any such objection. The plaintiff cannot claim by estoppel, and these facts did not amount to an estoppel. The assignee can only avail himself of such title as Richardson had. Freeman v. Cook[1]; Clarke v. Hart[2]. It was a fact immaterial to the issue\u2014it was not made matter of replication, and any replication of that fact would have been demurrable, and therefore such a ground is not now available to plaintiff.\nThe case of ex parte English v. American Bank[3] is an authority that the defendants did not lose their title to the fish by alleging in the proof of claim that they held no security for the claim. A creditor can properly so attest if he holds no security from the insolvent. Insolvent Act of 1875[4]; McMahoris Insolvent Act[5].\nMy second point is that the fish were the property of defendants, either absolutely or as pledged to them by Shaw. Langton y. Higgins[6].\nIf the fish are the property of Shaw, as assumed in and stated by the judgment, and the defendants were merely the custodians of them, they had at least the right on Shaw's behalf to hold the fish for the unpaid purchase money. Benjamin on Sales[7]; Bullen and Leake[8].\nThere was a lien on the fish for unpaid purchase money, and whether this lien was in Shaw or the defendants, it was an answer to the action. Butler v. Hobson[9]; Gadsden v. Barron[10]; Leake v. Loveday[11].\nThere was a lien, according to the Chief Justice's finding, for insurance and storage, which he deducted from plaintiff's damages. The validity of any such charges (which the learned judge expressly affirmed) did not constitute them a set-off against the plaintiff's damages, but constituted a defence to the action, and one that did not require to be pleaded. Bullen & Leake[12].\nFinally, I submit even if the fish were only left with defendants to sell for Shaw, they had such an interest that Shaw could not revoke their authority and sell without their consent. Tones v. Hodgskins[13]; Benjamin on Sales[14]; Gaussen v. Morton[15]; Walsh v. Whitcomb[16]. Mr. Rigby, Q.C., for respondent:\nA good deal of my learned friend's' argument is based upon the assumption that the learned judge only found upon one of the facts in issue. Now, in order to arrive at the conclusion he did, he must have found that the fish was Richardson's and had been originally Shaw's, This special finding is an addition to the general verdict in our favor. There were only two issues raised by the pleadings: the first issue denies the commission of trover, and second, goods not plaintiff's and he had no right to possession. Now my learned friend rests his contention entirely upon the lien of an unpaid vendor. I contend he cannot raise the question of lien at all under our practice act. Then, we come to the question of fact. Whose property was it? It is not denied that it was Richardson's, but they say there was an equitable assignment of it. Surely that must be pleaded.\nThere is no proof that the appellants are defending this suit for or on behalf of Shaw, and if not, they cannot, under any circumstances, set up the non-payment of the note or Richardson's insolvency as a defence to this action, and they cannot, under the state of the pleadings herein, in view of the provisions of c, 94 of the Revised Statutes, fourth series, and especially of s. 152 thereof, set up any such defence.\nIf the appellants' claim to hold the fish be founded on stoppage in transitu, there is no proof that Shaw ever exercised such right, nor that he authorized the appellants to do so, nor that they did so. In order to constitute stoppage in transitu, there must be some act or declaration on the part of the vendor countermanding delivery. Benjamin on Sales[17].\nIf any such right existed, and could under the circumstances in proof herein be properly exercised, it gave at most only the right to detain, and not to sell, the goods, and by selling them th\u00e9 appellants were guilty of a conversion, and respondent is therefore entitled to recover. Roscoe's Nisi Prius[18].\nThe transitus was at an end when the goods were sold by Shaw to Richardson.\nPart of the fish, viz., 36 barrels, having been delivered, it must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed equivalent to delivery of the whole, and the right of stoppage in transitu was at an end.\nThe respondent in any point of view\u2014the contract made with Shaw never having been rescinded\u2014had the right to tender the portion of the purchase-money remaining unpaid, and thus entitle himself to the goods, and any profit or advantage to accrue from their possession; and the appellants, by not setting up when the several demands were made their alleged right to detain, have misled the respondent, and have also waived and lost all right, if any such ever existed, to insist upon a lien or right to detain.\nThe only other point I intend to urge is, that the defendants cannot set up either a lien for charges or unpaid balance account, because they filed a claim for their note with a sworn statement that they had no security and received a dividend.\nThe defendants knew that Richardson, at his first meeting, claimed the fish as his, and although Lewis, one of the appellants, informed himself, as he says, between the first and second meeting, as to the accuracy of this claim, yet he made no objections to such claim at the second meeting, although the claim on the part of Richardson to the fish was repeated at the second meeting.\nMr. Thompson, Q.O., in reply. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nDefendants were commission merchants and warehousemen. One Shaw, living at L'Ardoise, in the island of Cape Breton, a distance from Halifax, was in habit of dealing with them, they supplying him with goods, he sending them his fish, which they stored and sold, and credited him with the proceeds. In the summer of 1877 Shaw had in the store of defendants 286 barrels of mackerel. Richardson, the insolvent, says, and I think all the surrounding circumstances corroborate his testimony, that\nMr. Troop told him they had 236 No. 3 mackerel (large), belonging to Shaw. I was asked by Troop what they were worth, and I said $8, Troop said he did not want to sell these, a? Shaw was on his way from Cape Breton and would dispose of them himself. He said, \"I might probably buy them from him,\" and I said, \"probably\" and did so.\nOn the 3rd November, 1877, Shaw, being in Halifax, sold all the fish he had, including those mackerel, to Richardson, the mackerel at $8 a barrel = $1,828\nfor the 236 barrels. The whole sale amounting to $8,101.11\nfor which Richardson paid, half cash, or $4,050 56\nAnd half by a note at 4 months for 4,050 56\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$8,101 12\nShortly after the sale and date of the note at 3 months, Shaw endorsed the note to defendants on account of his indebtedness to them. The note would fall due on 6th March, 1878. All the fish sold, except the 236 barrels, were at time of sale in two vessels, and of all these fish Richardson got the actual delivery. The 236 barrels remained in defendants' store. On the 4th March, 1878, before the note fell due, Richardson assigned under the Insolvent Act of 1869.\nPlaintiff became assignee of the insolvent, 15th March, 1878. On the 16th March verbal demand was made on defendants for the fish. On 22nd March, 1878, defendants sold 200 barrels of the fish to West.\nOn 4th April a written demand was made on defendants for the fish; and\nOn 6th April, 1878, the writ was issued in the case; and\nOn 7th May, 1878, defendants sold the remaining 36 barrels to Cochran,\nThere were three meetings of Richardson's creditors after the assignment, and no meeting after the 18th March. At these meetings one of the defendants, Lewis, attended, and at these meetings a statement was produced of the insolvent's assets, in which among the items of assets the fish now in dispute was put down as \"236 bbls. mackerel, stored at Black Bros.\" At the first meeting the defendants took a copy of this statement. The witness, W. H. Hart, inspector, and a creditor, who was present at the three meetings says:\nStatements of the assets and liabilities were read at them all. \"A\" was one of them. I heard no objection raised by Lewis at any of the meetings, nor by any one else.\nAnd on cross-examination, he says:\nEach of the items in \"A\" were read over and discussed; and at all those meetings, the statement of the personal property in \"A\" was generally thought correct. Lewis spoke several times. \"A\" was parsed round and read. I heard no objection to the personal items.\nThis was fully confirmed by other witnesses present. Though taking apparently a very active part, and fully informed as to these fish being claimed as the property of the insolvent, and as an item of his estate available for his creditors, neither this defendant nor his firm ever set up any claim thereto or lien thereon on behalf of themselves, Shaw, or any one else, but, on the contrary, filed with the assignee a claim against Richardson's estate as follows;\u2014 Halifax, N. S., December, 1879.\nMr. W. M. Richardson to Black Bros. & Co., Dr.\nMarch 6, 1878. To cash retired his note favor D. N. Shaw.. $4050 56\nAnd supported the claim by an affidavit sworn to, 8th January, 1880, by Lewis, in which he says:\n1. I am a member of the firm of Black Bros & Co., claimants, and the said firm is composed of myself and of George J. Troop, also of Halifax. 2. The insolvent is indebted to the claimants in the sum of four thousand and fifty dollars and fifty six cents. 3. The claimants hold no security for the claim, and I have signed.\nAnd the plaintiff, the assignee, says:\nI paid defendants $577.20, 10th February, 1880, a dividend on the note in claim 14\u00a3 cents on the dollar.\nI think there is satisfactory evidence in this case to show that whatever may have been the general dealings or relations between Shaw and defendants with respect to these fish, they clearly refused to sell them on account of Shaw, and left Shaw to deal with and sell them entirely independent of them, and referred Richardson to him to buy them direct from him without their intervention, and necessarily free from any claim that might have existed, growing out of the general dealings of defendants with Shaw; and there can be no doubt that under such sale by Shaw to Richardson, the latter would, up to the time of his insolvency, have been entitled to demand and receive from defendants the said goods, wholly free from any lien or claim arising from such general dealings between Shaw and defendants, and also in like manner as against Shaw, would have been entitled to have delivery and possession of the goods. Such being the case, and defendants in their own rights having no lien, had Shaw a lien? and, if so, did defendants deal with those goods by virtue of such claim, or have they set up Shaw's lien as a defence to this action? There can be no doubt that if a vendor sells on time and takes a bill of exchange or promissory note for the price, he loses his lien on the goods sold, though in like manner there can be no doubt that it revives on the dishonor of the instrument in the hands of the vendor; that is to say, if a purchaser becomes insolvent before the goods are actually delivered, the vendor's right to refuse delivery revives, the law does not compel the vendor to deliver to an insolvent purchaser, but if the buyer does not become insolvent during the time that the bill is current, there is no vendor's lien, and the vendor is bound to deliver. It is stated in some of the text books that such lien dees not revive on the dishonor of the instrument, if it be then outstanding in the hands of a third person, and in support of this proposition the case of Bunny v. Poynts[19] is generally to be found cited, but that was a case where the agent of the vendor took the notes of the vendee and another for the price and discounted them with his banker and endorsed them, but the vendor, his employer, did not endorse them. The court held the vendor must be considered as having received payment for his goods and could not retain them, though his agent afterwards became bankrupt and the notes were dishonored. It is somewhat difficult to understand why the fact of the notes being endorsed by the agent or the principal should make any difference in the right of the principal to retain the goods on dishonor of the note. If the creditor negotiates the bill or note for value and without rendering himself liable, it will operate as payment though dishonored, for in such a case he has obtained value which he cannot be compelled to refund, and therefore, if by a lien on the goods he could recover the price he would be paid twice. But if the creditor negotiates the bill or note, so as render himself personally liable upon it, in that case it will not operate as a payment, if dishonored.\nIt is said the bill is still outstanding; that is true, and it may, perhaps, operate to prevent the seller from having a complete right to the goods so as to be able to give a valid title by re-selling them to a third party, but the only question in the present case is whether he has not a right to hold them till the price is paid.\nBut if the goods sold are in the warehouse of a third person, and he assented to hold them as agent for the vendee, then there would have been a delivery of the goods, and the possession of the warehouseman would be the possession of the vendee, and all right of lien on the part of the vendor would be gone. In other words\u00bb the right of property and possession would both have passed from Shaw to the insolvent, and the right of lien would be destroyed, or rather would not exist.\nIn this case, did not defendants, by their conduct, recognize Richardson and his assignee, as having the absolute right in the property and the possession of the goods?\nIt is in vain to say that defendants did not know of the sale to Richardson. It was at their instance that Richardson negotiated with and bought from Shaw. They received the cash and note given by Richardson in payment for these and the other fish, and it is asking too much to expect us to believe that they did not know for what the notes and cash were given; the non-production of the warehouse books and of their warehouseman, the sending to Richardson the notice of the running out of the insurance (for it is clear it could only have come from their establishment), their non-insuring the goods for the benefit of themselves or Shaw after the sale, then allowing the insurance to run 6ut the statement of Troop that the storage was at a fixed rate, and his saying: \"I charged Richardson the usual rate,\" taken in connection with the non-repudiation of Richardson's property in the goods and the right to them of the plaintiff, as his assignee, at the several meetings of the creditors, the not setting up any claim of lien of any sort, or in any person when the property was demanded, or of Shaw on the trial, the non-assertion of any lien being on the goods, the entire absence of Shaw from any participation in the doings of the plaintiff in reference to securing these goods, the entire absence of the assertion of any claim of lien or otherwise by Shaw or by defendants in his behalf, the putting in of their claim to the full amount of the note, their swearing, long after this action was brought, that Richardson s estate owed thereon the full amount, and that they held no other security, would, in my opinion, fully justify a jury in coming to the conclusion that defendants acknowledged Richardson as owner, and that they actually held the goods for him; if &o, then Shaw would have no lien, for Lord Campbell in Pearson v. Dawson says[20]:\nThe title of the purchaser being once acknowledged by the warehouseman, the purchaser has a right to treat the warehouseman as his agent, and the latter cannot afterwards set up a right in respect of a third party.\nIt is true Mr. Troop says in cross-examination:\nThe first notice we had of Richardson's claim on the fish was after the insolvency.\nThis may be so, but it is quite consistent therewith that his partner and his warehouseman or managing man may have had full knowledge of the whole transaction, and it is to be remarked that his partner is on this point suggestively silent. He does say:\nI had no knowledge till yesterday (27th April, 1880,) of what fish was sold to Richardson or that it extended beyond the two cargoes.\nThis is entirely irreconcilable with all the evidence in the case, and it is the more strange that with the two cargoes they had nothing to do, these having been sold by Shaw himself from the vessels, and it is still more strange, when it is recollected what took place at the meetings in March, 1878; and the finding of the Chief Justice was, \"that defendants had knowledge that the \"fish sued for were included by the insolvent in the \"statement of his assets, and made no objection thereto \"known to the assignee or creditors at the meeting;\" and which finding is supported by overwhelming evidence. There is no evidence whatever that notice of dishonor of this note was ever given to Shaw, or that the defendants hold him in any way liable thereon as indorser, or that Shaw in Cape Breton had any notice or knowledge of Richardson's insolvency at Halifax, or that he had any notice or knowledge of the note having been dishonored. Nor is there any evidence whatever that Shaw in any way directly or indirectly authorized defendants to set up any lien on his behalf on the said goods, or that he ever knew that any such claim ever was so set up nor in fact is there a title of evidence to show that defendants, with or without the consent or knowledge or authority of Shaw, ever did set up such claim on his behalf, or that they ever did deal with or claim to deal with the fish as the agents of or as authorized in any way by Shaw so to do; on the contrary, the fair inference from the evidence is that, on the ground that they had a claim on them in their own right, they dealt with the fish of their own mere motion without reference to Shaw or anybody else, and that they received the proceeds of the sales to West and Cochran, without accounting to the plaintiff as assignee of the estate of Richardson, or without crediting the proceeds on the note, though they say the amounts of the sales were credited to Shaw. If they sold them on Shaw's lien they should have credited the insolvent or his assignee on the note, and not Shaw, but it does not appear that that fact was ever communicated to Shaw by them, or that he ever had any knowledge of it. On the contrary, without any apparent communication with Shaw on the subject, and, so far as the evidence shows, without any reference to him or to the said sale, some two years after, the defendants prove the whole amount of the note was due by the insolvent estate to them, and claimed and received a dividend on such full amount, a proceeding wholly inconsistent with a sale of the fish under a lien (supposing, if a lien, a sale would be justifiable,) for the fish appear to have been sold;\n200 barrels for $7.50 and 36 at $6.30 would amount to\n$1,734 00\nand deducting charges, &c, in which there are items which could not be charged against the insolvent, supposing there was\n67 15\nthere would be a balance of\n$1,666 85\nwhich, if the property had been sold under Shaw's or any other lien, would have to be credited on account of the note, for the security of which the lien, if any, must have existed. And would leave only $2,383.71 instead of $4,050.56, \"due on the note, for which any claim could possibly be made on the insolvent estate. The sworn claim, therefore, that the defendants put in for the full amount of the note, and for which they swore they had no security, is conclusive, to my mind, that they did not dispose of the said fish by virtue of any right of lien or under any authority from Shaw, or by or with his consent or approval, and in this connection it may not be amiss to notice that a vendor will lose his right of lien if he prove for the price of the goods under an adjudication in bankruptcy against the vendee. Exp. Hornby[21].\nAgain, if Shaw had a lien, neither Shaw nor defendants, supposing they were acting for them, had any right to sell or dispose of the goods, and such sale was a conversion as against the assignee, in whom the property was, subject to the lien. Assuming that under a plea of not possessed a lien may be given in evidence, still, if you admit evidence of a lien you cannot exclude evidence to show that it had ceased to exist at the time of the conversion, so that supposing the defendants had a lien on these goods, and he should prove it under the plea of not possessed, the plaintiff would be entitled to show that the lien had ceased at the time he converted them.\nThe defendants clearly had no right to sell the goods, as they\" had no property in them; they do sell the goods and thereby necessarily put an end to the lien, if any existed. Continuance of possession being indispensable to the existence of liens at law, an abandonment of the property over which the right extends divests the lien.\nBut assuming again that Shaw had a lien, the defendants cannot, under the pleadings in this case, set up such a defence to this action, and if they could, under the pleas in this case, set up a lien in Shaw, they could not justify, as against the assignee of Richardson, in whom the general property in these fish was, a sale and conversion unauthorized by Shaw, and unwarranted if authorized.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharging a rule nisi for a new trial. The facts on which the questions presented for the decision of the court arise, are as follows: In October, 1877, one D. N. Shaw, a merchant at L'Ardoise, in Cape Breton, consigned to the appellants, merchants at Halt' fax, trading under the name of Black Bros., a quantity of fish consisting of 236 barrels of mackerel and 77 barrels of herring. These fish were stored by the defendants. Shaw had for some time previous to this consignment been in the habit of dealing with the defendants, who supplied him with goods, and Shaw consigned fish to the defendants, who sold them and credited him with the proceeds. That this was the regular course of dealing between Shaw and the defendants is proved by both the latter and not contradicted. The defendant Troop in his evidence says:\nShaw lives at L\u2019Ardoise. We are still dealing with him. We supply him with goods and he sends us his fish. We store the pickled fish, and when we sell it credit him with the proceeds.\nThe defendant Lewis says:\nShaw dealt with us largely; made all his purchases through us $ sent us all his fish to be sold and the proceeds put to his credit. That was the course of dealing. In 1877 we supplied him throughout the year. In the fall of 1877 he sent us fish. * * * During the winter we sold the herring to Twining, and the 236 barrels of mackerel to West * * *\nSome time in November he (Shaw) endorsed the note to us on account of his debt to us. He paid us several sums of money in November. * * * After the note and payment made by Shaw, he was still in our debt. He is still in our debt.\nHe also says:\nWe had no special agreement with Shaw as to those fish.\nIn November, 1877, Shaw came to Halifax and W. M. Richardson, of whom the respondent is the assignee in insolvency, purchased from him a large quantity of fish comprising, amongst other lots, 292 barrels of mackerel at $8 per barrel. This lot of 292 barrels included the 236 barrels, which had previously been consigned to the appellants, and were at the time of sale held in store by them. The difference, 56 barrels of mackerel and the rest of the fish purchased by Richardson, were delivered to him by Shaw &t the wharf, never having been in the possession of the appellants.\nRichardson says in his evidence that before he made\n[Page 529\nhis purchase one of the appellants (Troop) told him they did not want to sell the fish in their hands as Shaw was on his way from Cape Breton, and would probably dispose of them himself, and that Richardson might probably buy them from Shaw. This conversation is denied by Troop. He says:\nHe (Richardson) asked me if we expected Shaw, and when he came, to give him a chance or opportunity to purchase fish, Richardson in former years had bought Shaw's fish, and when he bought from Shaw he usually came to us and made an arrangement for the warehouse rent for the fish, the day after the purchase.\nThe price of all the fish purchased by Richardson from Shaw was $8,101.11\u2014of this amount, one-half was paid by Richardson to Shaw in cash, and for the other half, $4,050.56, Richardson gave Shaw his promissory note, dated 3rd November, 1877, payable four months after date. Dr. Lewis one of the appellants, swears that his firm had given Shaw no authority to sell the fish in their warehouse, but some time in November Shaw endorsed Richardson's note to the appellants on account of his debt to them. Lewis, however, says:\nI had no knowledge until yesterday of what fish was sold to Richardson or that it extended beyond the two cargoes.\nTroop swears:\nThe first notice we had of Richardson's claim on the fish was after the insolvency.\nFurther, Richardson states:\nI did not go to Black Bros, I got delivery of all the fish in the two vessels. I never went there to look after the fish or make arrangements for storage. I paid them storage in previous years.\nThere is a seeming inconsistency between these several statements of the appellants and Richardson and that of Troop on cross-examination, when the latter says:\nThe storage is at a fixed rate. I charged Richardson the usual rate;\nif, by this, it is meant that the appellants charged Richardson storage on the 236 barrels of mackerel in dispute.\nOn the 4th of March, 1878, and before the promissory note, which did not mature until the 7th of March, fell due, Richardson became insolvent and executed an assignment under the Insolvency Act of 1869. At this time the appellants still had the 236 barrels of fish in their possession. The respondent was appointed the creditors' assignee of Richardson's estate on the 15th March, 1878, and on the next day made a verbal demand on the appellants for the fish; the terms of the appellants' answer to this demand are not stated in the evidence; the respondent merely says, he did not get the fish. On the 4th April following a written demand was made, to which the appellants replied by a letter, referring the respondent to their solicitor.\nThe appellants, on the 22nd March, 1878, sold 200 barrels of the fish to Wed, and on the 17th May, 1878, they sold the remaining 36 barrels to Cochrane. This action was commenced on the 6th April, 1878. In the statement of assets belonging to the insolvent Richardson, received by the respondent from the official assignee, the fish now in dispute, described as \"238 barrels of mackerel stored at Black Bros., was included. This statement was produced and handed round at two, if not at three, meetings of Richardson's creditors, held prior to the 18th March, 1878, at both of which the appellant Lewis was present. Dr Lewis admits having seen the statement at the first meeting held before the assignment, though there is some contradiction between him and the other witnesses as to whether the statement was read or produced at the subsequent meeting. No objection was made by Dr. Lewis to the statement in respect of the fish in question in Black Bros, warehouse being the property of the insolvent. Dr. Lewis's evidence on this point is as follows; I saw the statement \"A\" at the first meeting; it was handed round; not read aloud; I said to those around me that I knew of no fish of Richardson's stored in our store; I did not see \"A\" at the second meeting, nor hear it read. Between the first and second meetings I had ascertained that my impression at the first was correct: At the second there was no discussion as to the assets.\nIn January, 1880, long after this action had been commenced and after appellants must have ascertained the facts of Shaw having sold or assumed to sell this identical lot of fish to Richardson, and that the price was included in the note, which had been indorsed by them to Shaw; the appellants proved their debt on the note in the insolvency matter, the proof of the claim being made by Dr. Lewis, who, in his affidavit, swore that the appellants held no security for the claim; and on this proof, a dividend amounting to $577.20 being at the rate declared of 14| cents on the dollar, was afterwards paid by the assignee to the appellants.\nThe declaration was in trover for the conversion of the fish, and the pleas were, not guilty, not possessed, and a traverse of the respondents' property in the goods. The action was tried on the 28th of April, 1880, before the late Chief Justice of Nova Scotia (Sir William Young) without a jury, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff for $1,841.90, being the value of the 236 barrels of mackerel at $8 per barrel, less the sum of $46.10 allowed for insurance and storage.\nShaw was not called as a witness at the trial. It appears from the judge's notes of the trial that the Attorney General, for the defendants, then raised the same point of lien which he insisted on in the argument here. The note being as follows:\nAttorney General closes for defendant (Benjamin on Sales, 626; 7 B. & P. 567.) Stoppage in transit and the right of detention for payment on the same principle, 4 B. & Cr. 941, 951; 1 El. & El. 680.\nThe reference to 4 B; & Cr. 941 is to the cases of Bloxam v. Sander, and Bloxam v. Morley, the leading cases on the law of vendor's lien in cases of insolvency. The Chief Justice found for the plaintiff upon the ground, as expressed in his note, that the \"defendants had knowledge that the fish sued for were included by the insolvent in the statement of his assets, and made no objection thereto known to the assignee or creditors at the meeting.\" The Chief Justice adds to his finding this further note:\nIf a rule nisi for a new trial is moved for, I shall readily acquiesce in it, that the case may be argued and thoroughly examined.\nfrom which it appears that it was intended that all questions of law arising on the evidence should be open at the argument on the application for a new trial, and, at all events, that the defendants were not to be precluded from raising then the same points which they had insisted on at the trial. The court in banc afterwards granted a rule nisi to set aside this verdict, which was upon argument discharged with costs.\nIt was contended on the argument of the appeal before this court, by the Attorney General, on behalf of the appellants\u20141st. That Shaw had a lien upon the 236 barrels of fish for the unpaid residue of the price of all the fish sold by him to Richardson, i.e., for the amount of the promissory note, which lien, the appellants were entitled to set up and enforce. 2nd. That if Shaw had not such a lien, the appellants themselves, under the arrangement with Shaw upon which the fish had been consigned to them, were entitled to one in their own right for the price of the 236 barrels in question.\nThere is, I think, nothing in the objection that the defence of a lien either in Shaw or in the defendants themselves was not admissible under the pleadings. The evidence of conversion was, as regards all the goods claimed, the demand and refusal to deliver, and also as regards 200 barrels, the sale to West before the action; the remaining 36 barrels not having been sold to Cochrane until after action brought, the demand and refusal constitute the only evidence of the conversion of that quantity. The effect of not guilty, in an action for conversion under the English rule of Trinity Term, 1853, with which section 146 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4 Series) cap. 94 is identical, is stated in William's notes to Saunders[22], as follows:\nAfter some contrariety of decision, it is now settled that under the rule the plea of not guilty puts in issue not only the fact of the conversion, but also its righteousness[23].\nAnd this is not affected by sec. 144 of Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4 series) cap. 94. Then as the right to the possession, as well to the property in the goods, at the time of conversion is requisite to enable a party to maintain an action of this kind, a right of lien, either in the defendants in their own right or in Shaw, whose agents the defendants were, as I shall hereafter establish, is a sufficient defence to the action as disentitling the plaintiff to the possession; and it is clear upon authority that such a lien may be set up under pleas traversing the plaintiff's property and possession[24], for even assuming that the appellant had no right to re-sell, yet, as the buyer had no title to the immediate possession of the goods at the time of conversion, the defence must be admissible under the plea of not possessed. In William's notes to Saunders,[25] it is said:\nAgain, on the principle that there must exist a right of possession as well as property to support trover, it is held, that although a vendee of goods acquires a right of property by the contract of sale, he cannot maintain trover for them, until he pays or tenders the price, for until this is done he does not (unless the goods were sold on credit) acquire a right of possession to them[26].\nThis principle is also very clearly stated by Mr. Benjamin in his Treatise on Sales[27]. He says:\nIn the case of re sale, a buyer in default cannot maintain trover against the vendor, being deprived by his default of that right of possession without which trover will not lie.\nI have noticed this question of pleading, not because it gives rise to any difficulty, but for the reason that it was strenuously contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the defence was not open to the appellants on this record.\nThen proceeding to consider the substantial question raised by this appeal, I am inclined to the opinion, that although as between themselves and Shaw, the appellants originally had, under the arrangement upon which consignments were made to them by Shaw, a lien or rather a special property in these goods with a power of sale, and authority to apply the proceeds in payment of Shaw's debt to them, their conduct has been such as to have debarred them from insisting upon it as against Richardson or the respondent as his assignee, as a paramount title invalidating the sale by Shaw to Richardson.\nRichardson says:\nShortly before the purchase, Mr. Troop told me they had 236 barrels No. 3 mackerel belonging to Shaw; I was asked by Troop what they were worth, and I said $8. Troop said he did not want to sell them as Shaw was on his way from Cape Breton, and would dispose of them himself. He said, I might probably buy them from him, and I said \"probably,\" and did so.\nI think we must assume Richardson's account of this conversation to be correct, for by purchasing the fish from Shaw, he acted upon what he states Troop to have said to him, in a way he would hardly have done, had he not considered Shaw had the right to sell free from all lien or other superior title on the part of the appellants. This view of the evidence is also consistent with the conduct pf the appellants in not setting up their claim when they found Richardson had included the fish in his list of assets, I assume, therefore, that the appellants are precluded from setting up in their own right any title paramount under the terms of Richardson's consignment to them. The property must, therefore be deemed to have been in their hands in the character of bailees, i.e. as warehousemen for Shaw at the time of the sale by the latter to Richardson. Then, assuming for the present that the appellants continued to hold the goods in the character of warehousemen for Shaw down to the date of Richardson s insolvency, two questions arise\u20141st. Was it competent to the defendants to set up Shaw's rights as an unpaid vendor? 2nd. What was the nature and extent of those rights?\nIt is clear upon the most elementary principles of the law of agency that an agent, such as a warehouseman, in possession of goods deposited with him by a principal, who has afterwards sold them under a contract of sale which has operated to pass the property to the vendee, is in such privity with his vendor, that he not only may, but must, in order to perform his duty to his principal and protect himself from liability to him, set up any lien or right of retention until payment, which the vendor to the knowledge of his agent may have, in answer to the vendee's demand of possession without payment. If, under such conditions, a warehouseman were to deliver the goods to the purchaser without payment, thus waiving the lien he would be personally liable to indemnify his principal against the loss so caused. It is out of the question, therefore, to say in the present case that the appellants holding these goods as Warehousemen for Shaw were setting up a jus tertii in insisting upon Shaw's lien[28].\nNext we are to consider what were Shaw's rights in these fish, still assuming that at the time of the sale to Richardson they were held by the appellants as warehousemen for Shaw, and that there was never any change in the character of their possession as such.\nThe promissory note for $4,050.56, which had been given by Richardson on account of one-half the price of the whole lot of fish purchased by him from Shaw, including the two cargoes delivered at the wharf and those now in question, was, at the time of the insolvency and also at the date of the commencement of this action, in the hands oi the appellants as holders for value, having been endorsed to them by Shaw on account of his debt to the appellants; and at the date of the insolvency which occurred on the 4th March this note was still current, not maturing until the 7th of March, 1878. The case is therefore to be considered precisely as if this note had been outstanding in the hands of some third person other than the appellants, holding it as a bon\u00e2 fide indorse for value. Would it then have been competent for Shaw, having taken a negotiable security for the unpaid portion of the price, which he had transferred to a holder for valuable consideration, to have asserted a lien on the goods on the occurrence of Richardson's insolvency?\nThere can be no doubt that the property had passed to Richardson by the operation of the sale, the goods having been ascertained and the requirements of the Statute of Frauds having been satisfied by the receipt and acceptance by Richardson of the two cargoes delivered at the wharf. The only question is as to the lien or right of retention for the price, arising upon the insolvency of the vendee. It is a well established rule that upon the sale of ascertained chattels upon credit the vendee not only acquires the property in the goods sold, but has also a right to the immediate possession. If, however, the price is not paid at the expiration of the term of credit, or if before that period, and during the currency of the credit, the vendee becomes insolvent a lien at once arises entitling the vendor to retain the goods still remaining in his actual possession or in that of his bailee until payment. Further, the vendor is entitled to insist on this lien as well in the case where a bill or note has been taken for the purchase money as in that where the price is unsecured; and the circumstance that a bill so taken is outstanding in the hands of a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value makes no difference in the vendor's rights if he is himself liable as an indorser on the bill. It is also settled by authority that the vendor by consenting to hold the goods as a warehouseman for the purchaser, does not disentitle himself to insist on the lien. If, however, the goods are in the custody of a warehouseman who, upon the sale, has atoned to the purchaser, as the goods can then in no sense be said to be in the possession of the vendor, the right of lien is gone.\nThese principles are so well established that a reference to authorities in support of them is scarcely required. It may be useful, however, to point out a few amongst the numerous decided cases which show that the law is thus settled beyond controversy. Most of these are referred to by Mr. Benjamin in his Treatise on Sales[29], in which is to be found a very full discussion of the vendor's right in this respect. The leading case is Bloxam v. Sanders[30], In the course of his judgment in that case Bayley, J., states the law very fully and clearly, In this case of Bloxam v. Sanders the term of credit, upon which the goods had been sold, had expired at 'the date of the resale. The general doctrine here referred to was also clearly expounded and acted upon in the recent case of Grice v. Henderson[31]. But the proposition that goods which have been sold on a credit which has not expired, so that the vendee, being solvent, would be entitled to immediate possession, may, upon the vendee's insolvency occurring be retained by the vendor until payment, and that although bills have been given for the price which have been negotiated and are still current and outstanding in the hands of third parties, holders for value, does not depend merely upon the dictum of Mr. Justice Bayley in Bloxam v. Sanders, in which these circumstances did not occur, but is warranted by adjudicated cases in which these facts were actually presented. In the case of McEwan v. Smith[32], a quantity of sugar had been sold at a credit of four months, and a bill taken for the price, but upon the insolvency of the vendees taking place during the currency of the bill, the vendors were held entitled to refuse delivery until payment of the price. It does not appear in this case that the bill had been negotiated. Gunn v. Bolckow, Vaughan & Co.[33], was a case decided in the Court of Appeal in Chancery by Lords Justices James and Mellish. The defendants had contracted to sell to the Aberdare Iron Company a lot of railway iron which they manufactured, and which was approved and accepted by the vendees and stacked at the defendants' works. Wharfingers' certificates that the iron was lying at the vendors works ready for shipment were given to the Aberdare Company, who, upon receipt of these certificates, accepted bills for the price at six months date which Bolckow, Vaughan & Co. negotiated. The Aberdare Company handed the certificates to one Jones, whose administrator the plaintiff was, as security for a loan The plaintiff had given notice to the defendants that he claimed a lien on the rails for the amount of the loan. Subsequently the Aberdare Company became insolvent and filed a liquidation petition. At this time, two of the bills accepted by them had become due and had been dishonored. The other bills had not matured and were outstanding in the hands of holders for value. Upon this state of facts the Lords Justices held that the defendants were entitled to retain the iron for the whole price, as well for that portion which was represented by the bills not yet matured, and which were outstanding in the hands of bon\u00e2 fide holders, as for that covered by the bills which had been dishonored. Lord Justice Mellish says:\nNow, it is said that it is a question of fact to be tried, whether that acceptance was taken in satisfaction. * * * * * * * * * * * Whoever heard of such a thing in a mercantile contract, where it is said that payment is to be made by buyers acceptance of sellers' drafts, that if the acceptance was dishonored, the right to sue under the original contract did not revive? No one ever heard that if the purchaser became insolvent before the goods were actually delivered, the vendors' right to refuse delivery to an insolvent purchaser did not revive. Or even if he had actually started the goods, and delivered them to a carrier to be carried to the purchaser, it is perfectly well known that at law upon the buyers' insolvency there would be a right of stoppage in transitu which would revest the vendors lien.. It would make no difference that a bill had been given which had not yet become due, or that credit had been given. No doubt, if the buyer does not become insolvent, that is to say, if he does not openly proclaim his insolvency, then credit is given by taking the bill, and during the time that the bill is current there is no vendor's lien and the vendor is bound to deliver. But if the bill has been dishonored before the delivery has been made, there the vendor's lien revives; or if the purchaser becomes openly insolvent before the delivery actually takes place, then the law does not compel the vendor to deliver to an insolvent purchaser.\nThen, in a subsequent part of the judgment, the Lord Justice determines that the vendor's right to the lien for the whole price was not affected by the fact that some of the bills were outstanding in the hands of bon\u00e2 fide holders for value and that two of them had been dishonored.\nA very late writer on the law of sales,[34] thus sums up the result of the authorities:\nIf the buyer, being still indebted to the vendor in respect of the price, becomes insolvent before the vendor has parted with the possession, the rights of the latter revive When I say indebted, I include the case where payment has been made by a bill of exchange, on which the vendor, as well as the buyer is liable, or of which the vendor is himself the holder.\nAs I have already stated, the fact that the goods have been left in the custody of the vendor, even though he has assented to hold them as a warehouseman for the buyer and has been paid warehouse rent in respect of them makes no difference in the vendor's right to the lien, arising on the insolvency; if they are in the actual possession of the vendor, even although he has agreed to hold as a warehouseman, and has been paid as such for his care, he is entitled to retain until the price is paid. For this proposition Grice v. Richardson[35], Miles v. Gorton[36], and Townley v. Crump[37], are direct authorities, and are recognized as such by Mr. Benjamin[38]. If, however, the goods are not in the actual possession of the vendor himself, but were, at the time of sale, in the custody of a third party as a warehouseman or bailee, and have, after the sale and up to the date of the vendee's insolvency, remained in the possession of such third party, then the right of lien depends on the question whether the warehouseman has assented to hold the property as bailee for the purchaser or, as it is commonly expressed, has attorned to him. If the bailee has so attorned to the purchaser, it is clear that the goods can no longer be said to be in the possession of the vendor, and all right of lien is gone. If, however, the warehouseman has not, by his consent to hold for the buyer, established the relationship of bailor and bailee between them, he will not, although he has had notice of the sale and has even had presented to him the vendor's order for delivery to the vendee or to a sub-purchaser from him, be considered as holding for the vendee or sub-purchaser, but the goods will be considered as still remaining in the constructive possession of the seller, whose right of retention will revive on the insolvency of the purchaser. For this proposition I need only cite from amongst numerous authorities the single case of McEwan v. Smith[39] in the House of Lords, already referred to on another point. In that case the goods were sold on a credit of four months, an acceptance at that date being taken for the price and a delivery order given to the buyers by the vendors directing their agent, in whose name the property was stored in a bonded warehouse, to deliver it to the purchasers. The purchasers having become insolvent before the expiration of the credit, it was held that although the goods had been re-sold by the original purchasers and the delivery order duly transferred to their sub-vendee's, nothing had occurred to interfere with the vendor's right to a lien arising on the insolvency, Griffiths v. Perry[40] is also a case, in which it was expressly held, that the right of the vendor to retain the goods is not affected by the giving of a delivery order and its transfer to a subsequent purchaser. In short, as is observed by a late treatise writer already referred to[41]:\u2014\nThe criteria for transfer of possession so as to divest the vendor's rights are exactly the same as those for actual receipt, in regard to the Statute of Frauds.\nThe same author in the following extract also clearly states what is requisite to constitute the warehouseman the bailee of the purchaser[42]\nWhere the goods, notwithstanding the engagement to sell, remain in the custody of a middleman, who at the time of sale held them as warehouseman for the vendor, the question of actual receipt within the statute depends upon the consent of the three parties to the effect that the middleman shall thenceforth hold them as warehouseman for the buyer. Such joint consent constitutes an equivalent to delivery for, I think, every legal purpose. The most satisfactory evidence of it is an order by the vendor, and a note by the middleman acknowledging the order, and stating that the goods have been transferred in his books to the vendee.\nAgain Mr. Benjamin in his work on sales states the law thus (3):\nWhen the goods, at the tim\u00e9 of the sale, are in possession of a third person, an actual receipt takes place when the vendor, the purchaser, and the third person agree together that the latter shall cease to hold the goods for the vendor and shall hold them for the purchaser. They were in possession of an agent for the vendor, and therefore, in contemplation of law, in possession of the vendor himself, and they become in the possession of an agent for the purchaser, and therefore in that of the purchaser himself. But it is important to remark that all of the parties must join in this agreement, for the agent of the vendor cannot be converted into an agent for the vendee without his own knowledge and consent. Therefore, if the seller have goods in the possession of a warehouseman, a wharfinger, carrier, or any other bailee, his order given to the buyer directing the bailee to deliver the goods or to hold them subject to the control of the buyer, will not affect such a change of possession as amounts to actual receipt, unless the bailee accepts the order or re, cognizes it, or consents to act in accordance with it; and until he has so agreed he remains agent and bailee of the vendor.\nI have made these quotations for the reason that in the view which I take of the law applicable to this case I find myself dissenting from the other members of the court, and in deference to them I considered it incumbent on me to set forth, with the utmost fullness and clearness, the principles of law which I rely on as warranting the opinion I have formed. The obvious deductions from the foregoing authorities is, that mere notice of the sale to the warehouseman is not sufficient to create a privity between him and the purchaser; there must be beyond that an assent by the agent not merely to the sale, which must be a matter of indifference to him, but such an assent as will be sufficient to create a new contract for holding the goods between himself and the buyer, such as, if the bailment is not gratuitous, will entitle him to sue the latter for warehouse rent.\nThen to apply these principles, which I have thus extracted from the authorities, to the facts of the present case, it appears to me that, subject to what I shall hereafter have to say as to a statement contained in the evidence of Mr. Troop, one of the defendants, the result must be to sustain the present appeal The goods at the time of the sale to Richardson were in the hands of the defendants as warehousemen for Shaw. There is not, subject to the ambiguous passage in Mr. Troop's cross-examination to be referred to hereafter, a particle of evidence to show that the character of this possession was ever changed by the attornment of the defendants to Richardson, so as to create between them the relationship of bailee and bailor. On the contrary, Richardson himself swears positively that nothing was done to change the possession. The property in the fish, no doubt, passed to Richardson on the sale, and of this the defendants had notice, but it has been shewn that even an order directing the warehouseman to deliver the goods, much less notice of the sale, is insufficient to work a change of possession, unless the warehouseman in addition, expressly, or impliedly by words, or by conduct with the consent of the vendor, assents to hold for the vendee. That the defendants never made any new arrangement to hold for Richardson appears very distinctly from Richardson's own testimony; he says:\nI did not go to Black Bros. I got delivery of all fish in the two vessels. I never went there to look after fish or make arrangements for storage. I paid them storage in previous years.\nIt was contended on behalf of the respondent that the notice from the insurance agent of the expiration of the policy which had been effected by the defendants upon the fish must have been sent by them to Richardson, and that this implied a recognition of Richardson's constructive possession through the defendants as his bailees I am of opinion, however, that the Attorney General's answers to this argument are conclusive. First it nowhere appears in the evidence that this notice was transmitted by or through the defendants. All that is said about this notice is what is stated by Richardson and the defendants. The former says:\nAbout three weeks after the purchase, a young man brought me a notice of the insurance on that fish, the day before it was to expire, the 24th Nov. I made enquiry but did not insure.\nDr. Lewis, one of the defendants, says:\nI never sent any notice to Richardson or authorized any. We insured the fish ourselves.\nMr. Troop also denies all connection with this notice. He says:\nI never sent any notice as to the insurance of this fish to Richardson.\nThe fact of the defendants having forwarded the notice is therefore not established either directly or inferentially. But even if it had been distinctly proved, that the insurance agent having sent to Black Bros, the usual notice that their insurance was about to expire, they had transmitted it to Richardson, I should not have considered that the right of lien would have been in any way prejudiced by that circumstance. The property was undoubtedly in Richardson, and the fish were consequently at his risk; an insurance by him, with the assent of, and at the instance of, the defendants, would therefore have been in no way inconsistent with the fact of the goods being still in the constructive possession of Shaw, held by the defendants, as they had always held them, in the character of warehousemen for him.\nFor the like reason, I see nothing in the conduct of the defendant Lewis, with regard to the list of assets produced at the insolvency meeting, which can in any way affect the defendants' rights in the present case. The tacit acquiescence of Dr. Lewis, if, indeed, it amounted to that, in the statement that these fish belonged to Richardson, and were stored in the defendants' warehouse, involved no admission that the fish were held by the defendants as warehousemen for Richardson, or that he was entitled to a delivery of them without payment of the price. Further, the defendants' possession of the fish, originally held for Shaw, could not have been changed into one for Richardson, without the assent and privity of Shaw, and there is not the least proof of anything having been said or done by Shaw which could have that effect. It does not appear that any order or direction for delivery, either verbal or written, was ever given by Shaw, and Richardson does not pretend that he ever received such an order. If, therefore, the defendants are to be held in this action to have converted themselves into warehousemen for Richardson or his assignee, by force of any admission made at the creditors meeting, it would not relieve them from a like responsibility to Shaw; for their liability to the present plaintiff could only proceed on the principle of estoppel, and to warrant the conclusion that there was such an estoppel, involving as it would a double liability, the clearest and most unequivocal proof of representation or conduct, inconsistent with the defence put forward in this action must have been established[43], and no such evidence has been given.\nThat no estoppel could have arisen from any assent given by the defendants to the list of assets will be apparent from a slight consideration of the facts taken in connection with the first principles of the doctrine of estoppels. It is not shown that any of the creditors were in any way induced to alter their positions, or to do any act of any kind, on the strength of Dr. Lewis' silence, and, under the circumstances, it is not easy to see how they could have been led so to act. It was not the case of a compromise with creditors, or a deed of arrangement being entered into with their assent, but Richardson executed an assignment to an official assignee under the Dominion Insolvency Act of 1869, to which, of course, the creditors were not parties, and which required no consent of creditors and no previous statement to them of the amount of his assets. It is not even shown for what purpose the meetings preliminary to the assignment were held, and we can only conjecture that it was with a view of obtaining the advice of his creditors as to whether he should continue to carry on his business, compromise, or assign, that Richardson called them together. We are in like manner left entirely to conjecture whether the assignment was the result of the advice of the creditors or was made, as Richardson had a right to make it, without their consent. But even if we should assume that the assignment was the result of the advice or pressure, there is nothing to warrant the inference that this action of the creditors was in any way induced by the fact of these barrels of fish appearing in the list of assets, and the consequent assumption, that they were the property of the insolvent clear of any lien; and every presumption must be against such a conclusion from the facts. Therefore, in this respect one of the essential requisites of an estoppel in pais is wanting; for no proposition in law can be more plain in reason or better supported by authority than that which affirms it to be essential to the creation of this kind of estoppel, that the representation or concealment relied upon must not only have been made with the intention that the other party should act upon it, but also that the latter should have acted upon it in such a way as to change his position. Mr. Bigelow[44] in the treatise on Estoppel states this to be the law in so many words; he says:\nThe rule is well settled that if the representation, containing all the foregoing elements, has also been acted upon, the estoppel arises * * * But unless the representation is acted upon the estoppel cannot arise.\nAnd numerous authorities are cited which place this plain and well known principle beyond all controversy. The conclusion must be, that the failure of Dr. Lewis to object to the list of assets, or to explain the nature of Shaw's lien on this fish, can in no way prejudice the defendants in this action.\nIt appears, from the Chief Justice's notes of the trial, that a statement of the charges on the fish up to the time of sale delivered to Shaw by the defendants was put in and read. This document has not been printed amongst the exhibits, nor was it produced before this court, and I have not had an opportunity of seeing it. From the description given of it, however, it cannot possibly affect the defendants' liability. The mere circumstance that the defendants had rendered Shaw an account charging him with the storage up to the date of sale, when the property vested in Richardson, does not imply that from that date they held for Richardson, or charged warehouse rent to him by his authority, more especially is it not sufficient to prove any such fact when we find Richardson himself swearing as he does that he did not authorize such a change. There is, however, in the evidence of Troop, in his cross-examination, a statement which certainly requires explanation. He says:\nThe storage is at the fixed rate. I charged Richardson the usual rate.\nTaken by itself, isolated from the rest of Troop's testimony and the evidence of Richardson and Lewis, this might be taken to refer to the lot of fish now in question, but when read in connection with the context of Troop's evidence and the statements of the other witnesses, I consider it as referring to fish on former occasions Richardson had bought from Shaw, and had, under an express agreement with the defendants, warehoused with them. Taken in this sense, the passage I have quoted from Troop's evidence is not only consistent with what he had himself just before stated, but also with the statements of Richardson and Lewis. Troop in his examination in chief says:\nRichardson in former years had bought Shaw's fish, and when he bought from Shaw, he invariably came to us and made an arrangement for the fish, so bought, after the day of purchase. I gave Shaw no authority to sell the fish. I did not' know he had sold them until after the assignment. * * * I did not know that the sale to Richardson included the fish.\nDr. Lewis says:\nI had no knowledge till yesterday of what fish were sold to Richardson, or that it extended beyond the two cargoes.\nAnd in his cross-examination, he produced the warehouse book of his firm, from which it may be presumed it would have appeared that the fish had been transferred into Richardson's name, if any such transfer had in fact taken place, but no entry of the kind is extracted from the book or in any way referred to, from which I infer it contained none. Then Richardson himself entirely supports the view I take, for he swears: I did not go to Black Bros. I got delivery of all the fish in the two vessels. I never went to look after fish or make arrangements for storage. I paid them storage in previous years.\nI come to the conclusion, therefore, that it is impossible on this evidence to hold that the defendants ever attorned to Richardson, for there is not a scintilla of proof to warrant such a finding, except the passage in Troop's cross-examination, which I have already quoted, and which, read with the context and compared with the unequivocal statement of Richardson, can only have the meaning I attribute to it. Moreover, the Chief Justice does not appear to have found that there had been any change of the possession, and, even if there had been such a finding, supported, as it would have been, by no other proof than the vague and ambiguous statement appearing in the note of Troop's cross-examination, a statement entirely inconsistent with the testimony of the plaintiffs own witness, and not, so far as it appears, supported by any entry in the defendants' warehouse books, I should have thought a new trial proper in order to ascertain with accuracy what the facts in this respect really were. But, after all, I have, perhaps, attached too much importance to this question of evidence, which, however, was much relied on by the learned counsel for the respondent, for if the law as to the requisites to a transfer of possession by the attornment of a warehouseman is correctly stated, as undoubtedly it is, by Mr. Benjamin in the extract I have before made from his book, it could have made little difference even if it had appeared that the defendants had actually charged Richardson with the warehouse rent, and had entered the fish in their warehouse book as being held by him, in the face of Richardson's positive assertion that he never went to the defendants to look after the fish, or to make any arrangement about storage, for it must be remembered that no change of possession could have been worked by the act of the defendants alone, however clear and unequivocal, without the consent of Richardson, which, as just shown, he swears he never gave. Shaw's consent to the change of possession would also have been indisputable, and of that also there is no proof.\nThe promissory note for $4,050.56, which had been given by Richardson to Shaw on account of part of the price of all the fish sold, comprising as well the two cargoes delivered at the wharf as those stored in the defendants' warehouse, was endorsed by Shaw to the defendants, and he was liable upon it by reason of that endorsement. At the date of Richardson's assignment on the 4th March, 1878, this note had not matured, but it became due on the 7th March, and was overdue and unpaid when the demand of possession was made by the plaintiff, and when the defendants subsequently resold the fish. Therefore, although the authorities before adduced, particularly the cases of Gunn v, Bolckow, and McEwan'v. Smith, and the quotations from the opinions of text writers, show conclusively that, if the vendee has become insolvent, the vendor is not bound to deliver without payment, upon the demand of the vendee or his assignees during the currency of bills given for the price, yet in the present case, the defendants, being in the position of holders for an unpaid vendor, who has sold on a credit which has expired, do not require the support of those authorities. The defendants were no doubt bon\u00e2 fide holders for value of the promissory note, and the plaintiff is entitled to put the case against them, when they assert Shaw's lien, just as if the note had been outstanding in the hands of third parties, entire strangers to the transaction of the sale and holders for value. But the extract I have before given from the judgment of Lord Justice Mellish in Gunn v. Bolckow, the cases of Valpy v. Oakley[45], and Feize v. Wray[46], and the passage extracted from Mr. Campbell's work on sales all show that this makes no difference, as in reason it should not, in the right of a vendor to insist upon payment, either to himself or to the holder of the bill or note given for the price, before parting with the possession of goods sold to an insolvent vendee.\nThe note is put in evidence, and Shaw appears upon it as an indorser with the usual liability as such, the indorsement not being without recourse or in any way restrictive. The lien attached on the occurrence of the insolvency on the 4th March, 1878, during the currency of the note, which did not become jlue until the 7th of March. If it is objected, that it does not appear from the evidence that notice of dishonour was given to Shaw, so as to hold him liable upon the note, and that for all that appears he was discharged from liability, and his debt thus in effect satisfied, the answers to that argument are: 1st. That the lien having once attached, it was for the plaintiff, as representing the purchaser, to show that it was afterwards discharged, just as if he had relied on a discharge by actual payment. Secondly, that this same circumstance occurred in the case already cited of Gunn v. Bolckow, Vaughan Co., where Lord Justice Mellish expressly states of the two overdue bills, that although there was \"no evidence one way or the other as to their being indorsed or what has happened the vendors had a lien in respect of them; in other words, he presumed that the vendors were still liable to take up the bills, a presumption which we must make here as to Shaw's continued liability in the absence of all contrary proof. Thirdly, that this point was not made at the trial, when, if it had been raised, the appellants might possibly have shewn that due notice of dishonour was given.\nThis is an action for the conversion of the goods in question, and the facts relied on as evidence of a conversion are, first, the refusal of the defendants to deliver on the demand of the assignee, implied in the reference by the letter of the plaintiff to their solicitor; and, secondly, the resale of the goods, or at least of part them; for a portion was not sold until after action brought. Had the defendants coupled their refusal to deliver with a claim in any way inconsistent with the vendor's lien which they set up, they might have precluded themselves from now asserting it, but nothing of this kind was done; in answer to the demand of the plaintiff as assignee they wrote the letter of the 8th of April, 1878, which amounts to a refusal to deliver, based on no specific ground.\nIt was a sufficient defence for the defendants to show that, neither at the time of the refusal to deliver possession to the plaintiff, nor at the date of the subsequent re-sale, had the plaintiff any right to possession, and I cannot discover that the defendants had done anything to disentitle themselves to use any of the facts disclosed in the evidence for the purpose of establishing this defence.\nMy conclusion upon the whole case, therefore, is that the defendants, at the time of the refusal to deliver, and also at the date of the re-sale of the fish, held it as warehousemen for Shaw, an unpaid vendor who had originally sold on credit, and who therefore had a right, on the purchasers insolvency happening, to retain possession of the goods until actual payment either to himself or to the holders of the note given for the price. That this lien or right of retention was not confined to a proportionate part of the price equal to the price of the fish in the hands of the defendants, but extended to the whole amount of the unpaid purchase money of the whole lot of goods sold, secured by the promissory note, for the sale having been an entire one of the two cargoes, as well as of the fish in the warehouse of the defendants, the price was also an entire one[47]. The principle therefore applies that when there has been a sale of goods for an entire price, part of which have been delivered, the whole unpaid purchase money becomes a lien upon the undelivered residue of the goods[48]. The defendants therefore, both as warehousemen holding the property for Shaw, and as consignees, under the agreement upon which the fish was originally consigned to them, were entitled and bound to assert Shaw's rights and would have made themselves liable to him had they failed to do so. Further, that Shaw being liable upon the note as endorser, the fact that it was not held by him, but by the defendants to whom it had been transferred for value, did not disentitle him, and consequently does not disentitle the defendants as his agents, to insist on the lien.\nIt being clear that the plaintiff is not entitled to maintain an action for conversion, unless he was entitled to the possession as well as to the property at the time of the refusal to deliver and of the sales, it is immaterial to enquire, for the purpose of deciding the present appeal, whether a vendor, having the right of lien or retention arising upon the insolvency of the purchaser, has or has not a legal power of re-sale.\nIn Bloxam v. Sanders[49], and Bloxam v. Morley[50] already referred to, Mr. Justice Bayley states the law thus:\nIf, for instance, the original vendor sell when he ought not, they (the assignees of the buyer) may bring a special action against him for the damage they sustain by such wrongful sale, and recover damages to the extent of that injury; but they can maintain no action in which right of property and right of possession are both requisite, unless they have both those rights.\nMr. Benjamin points out that this judgment of Bayley, J., is said by Mr. Justice Blackburn[51], as recently as 1866 to be still a correct exposition of the \"peculiar law\" as to unpaid vendors, and the last mentioned writer, after having discussed at length[52] the whole question of the rights of unpaid vendors in respect of goods retained for the price in section 794 of his book, gives a summary of the rules which he deduces from the cases, one of which is as follows:\nFourthly. In the case of a re-sale, a buyer in default cannot maintain trover against the vendor, being deprived by his default of that right of possession without which trover will not lie.\nCampbell on sales[53] is to the same effect. He says:\nThese rights, commonly known as \"vendor's right?,\" include the right to retain the goods until payment of the whole price; but they are larger than a mere right of retention or lien, and extend in many cases to a right to re-sell the goods. In the case where the buyer has become insolvent, the vendor's rights extends to a right to sell the goods in order, to realise his debt. Where the buyer is not insolvent but is in default: If before the attempted re-sale, he makes tender of the price, the vendor's right is at an end, and the re-sale is void; but if no tender is made, the vendor may re-sell\u2014the buyer having no immediate right of possession and therefore being unable to complain of the act as a wrongful conversion of the goods.\nAnd the author cites the case of Milgate v. Kebble[54] and Lord v. Price[55] as authorities for his text. Lord Blackburn[56] thus gives his conclusion from the cases which had been decided at the time he wrote; he says:\nAssuming, therefore, what seems pretty well established, that the vendor's rights exceed a lien, and are greater than can be attributed to the assent of the purchaser, under the contract of sale, the question arises, how much greater than a lien are they? And this is a question which, in the present state of the law, no one will venture to answer positively, but as has been already said the better opinion seems to be, that in no case do they amount to a complete resumption of the right of property, or in other words to a right to rescind the contract of sale, but perhaps come nearer to the rights of a Pawnee with a power of sale than to any other common law rights, At all events it seems, that a re-sale by the vendor, while the purchaser continues in default, is not so wrongful as to authorize the purchaser to consider the contract rescinded, so as to entitle him to receive back any deposit of the price, or to resist payment of any balance of it still due; nor yet so tortious as to destroy the vendor's right to retain, and to entitle the purchaser to sue in trover.\nThen it was urged that the proof of the defendants, founded upon the note which had been endorsed to them by Shaio, against the insolvent estate of Richardson, and the receipt of a dividend upon that proof, was a waiver of the right of the defendants to set up any lien either in themselves or Shaw. In considering this objection, it is important to bear in mind the material dates. The refusal to deliver on the demand of the plaintiff was on the 4th April, 18*78; part of the fish (200 barrels) was sold to West on 22nd March, 1878; the residue was sold to Cochrane on 17th May, 1878; the, action was commenced on 6th April, 1878; the proof in insolvency was made on 8th January, 1880, and the dividend was received by the defendants on the 10th February, 1880.\nIt will be remembered that both counts of the declaration were for a conversion or in trover, and that the pleas were not guilty and a traverse of the plaintiff's property and right of possession. It is manifest that the defendants were entitled to succeed on the issue on the plea of not guilty, as well as on that on not possessed, if, at the time of the sale of the fish and the refusal to deliver on the plaintiff's demand, which refusal was merely evidence of a conversion, the defendants were entitled to set up Shaw's rights as an unpaid vendor, and to retain the fish in his right. That they were entitled so to do, I have already endeavoied to establish, Then; how could this subsequent proof, pendente lite, operate retroactively so as to alter the rights of the parties as they stood at the time the action was brought? A little consideration will, I think, show that for several reasons it could not possibly prejudice the defendants in their defence to this action. Troop says in his evidence that the net proceeds of both sales were credited to Shaw by the defendants. By this I understand that the money so credited was appropriated by the defendants, not as a payment on account of the note which they held, but to the unsecured balance of account on which Shaw was indebted to them. This, I think, was not a proper application of the payment, for the defendants were bound to have given credit for this money as a part payment of the note which had been endorsed to them by Shaw, and for the payment of which the fish, held by them as Shaw's agents, was in the nature of a collateral security in Shaiv's hands. That they did not do so, however, but claimed, and were permitted by the assignee to prove for, the whole amount, does not establish that they were guilty of illegal acts in withholding possession of the goods and afterwards selling them, but merely that they have obtained from the insolvent's estate more than they were entitled to claim. But this cannot have the retroactive effect of rendering illegal the acts referred to, when at the time of their commission, if I am right in my view of the law, were unobjectionable as regards the plaintiff, as assignee, if not perfectly legal. The remedy of the assignee in insolvency is plainly one which he must seek in the insolvency matter, viz., an application to reduce the proof and compel the defendants to repay so much of the dividend as they have improperly received. That the proof was excessive, i think is apparent. The defendants were entitled to prove only for the amount due for principal and interest upon the note after deducting the net proceeds of the sales. The defendants, it is true, were creditors in their own right, as bon\u00e2 fide endorsers for value, but the note being overdue, Shaw was in the position of a surety to them for the debt which it represented, and the goods remaining constructively in his possession are to be considered as held by him by way of counter security against his liability. Then, upon realising this security by the sale of the fish, Shaw through his agents, the defendants, became a trustee of the proceeds for the holders of the note, and was bound to apply the money so received to the payment pro tanto of the note. This he did in effect by allowing the defendants to receive and deal with the money as their own. But the defendants, so receiving this money with the knowledge of all the facts, were bound to impute it as a payment on account of the price of the fish\u2014that is, as part payment of the note\u2014in the same way that Shaw himself was bound to deal with it, and were not at liberty to apply it as a general and unappropriated payment by Shaw, by giving him credit for it on account of the general balance due to them by him, apart from the note. The result of all this, however, is only to show that, in a legal proceeding adopted by the defendants to obtain payment from Richardson's estate, they have received, without opposition, as far as it appears, from the assignee or other creditors, more than they were legally or equitably entitled to be paid, and this, not in a conclusive proceeding, but under a proof which it is competent for the court in insolvency at any time to reduce, and in this way to afford the plaintiff as assignee a complete remedy I cannot think that this has any bearing on the rights of the parties in this action; that it either shows the defendants to have been guilty of unlawful conversion, or that the plaintiff had a right to the possession of the fish at the time of the commencement of the action, which are the only questions to be here decided. Had the proof and receipt of dividend been before the action was brought, and prior in date to the sale of the fish and the refusal to deliver, the case might have admitted of different considerations.\nI have taken the least favorable view to the defendants in treating them as warehousemen for Shaw. It was, as I understood the Attorney-General, contended that, as under the terms of the original consignment the defendants had a right to sell the fish and apply the proceeds in reduction of Shaw's debt to them, they were entitled to adopt the sale which Shaw made, as though it had been made by him as their agent, in which case they would not only have all the rights which, in my judgment, Shaw himself the vendor, had, but they would be relieved from any difficulty, even if it should be considered that they had attorned to Richardson; since it is clear that if goods remain in the actual possession of the vendor himself, and not in that of a middleman, the lien for the price revives on non-payment or insolvency, notwithstanding the fact that the vendor has expressly constituted himself a warehouseman for the purchaser and has even received warehouse rent from him[57]. I have already said I incline to think the defendants are estopped from setting up this title by Troop's statement to Richardson, but I express no decided opinion upon the point.\nI think there should be a new trial on which it will be competent for the plaintiff to establish, if he can, that the defendants had adopted the character of bailees for Richardson, and held the fish for him, which would be conclusive against the defendants, unless they can make good the position, which I have last alluded to, of having been in legal construction the vendors of the fish through the agency of Shaw.\nMy judgment, therefore, is that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the rule nisi for a new trial should be made absolute and, in accordance with the Nova Scotia practice, with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI do not for a moment contradict the law as laid down by my brother Strong; the difficulty I have is, that the law, so correctly stated, does not apply to this case. Now, what do the defendants answer to the plaintiffs action: 1st. That they did not convert the property; 2nd. Deny that plaintiff, as assignee of Richardson, had any right to the property in question. The question then arises, what was the title of Richardson to the fish in question after the purchase by him from Shaw? The facts are these: Richardson purchased a quantity of fish from Shaw for which he paid one half in cash and balance by note at four months. He got delivery of part of the fish which was in vessels, but did not get the balance, viz., 236 barrels, which happened to be at the time of the sale in a store belonging to appellants. What was then the position of Richardson with regard to this fish? It cannot matter where the fish was, if it could be identified; the fish became by operation of law the property of Richardson. The plea put in is, that the fish does not belong to Richardson. If not his, whose property was it? Certainly not appellants, they never had a lien on the property, and did not plead one in themselves or in Shaw. If they had put in such a plea there might have been a question as to lien as between Richardson and Shaw, but in that plea they should have alleged the title of Shaw to the fish, and that they were holding it by his directions. Now there is no evidence that they held for Shaw, or that Shaw ever asserted any lien on the fish. If a lien had been pleaded in Shaw, it would have been necessary for them to show that Shaw was liable on the note which he endorsed over to the appellants; and on this point also there is no such evidence. The property in this case, in my opinion, passed to Richardson by a bill of parcels given by Shaw, and adopted by appellants, they agreeing from that date to hold the property for Richardson. Richardson's title depended upon his purchase and payment in virtue of which the property immediately vested in him. For these reasons, I am of opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWTNNE, J.:\u2014\nAs to the soundness of the principle of the cases upon which the learned counsel for the appellants so much relied there can be no doubt, but their applicability to the case before us is, in my judgment,; open to great doubt. The learned judge who pronounced the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sustaining the verdict rendered in favour of the plaintiff by the learned Chief Justice of that court, before whom the case was tried without a jury, referred, among other things, to a fact which appeared in evidence at the trial, namely: that the defendants claimed against the estate of Richardson in insolvency, as holders of the note which Richardson had made to Shaw for the balance of purchase money of the fish purchased by Richardson from Shaw, and received a dividend out of Richardson's estate in respect of that claim, and that in an affidavit made by Lewis, one of the defendants, in support of that claim, lie swore that the insolvent was indebted to himself and the other defendant in the sum of $4,050.56 (the amount of that note) for which they held no security.\nAt the time of the making of this affidavit the defendants, it is true, did not hold the fish, the conversion of which is the subject of this suit. They had already sold them; a part, in the month of March, and the remainder in the month of May, 1878; but they had received, and, according to their own shewing, had appropriated, the proceeds arising from the sale thereof, amounting to $1,734, to their own use, and gave no credit therefor to Richardson upon the note, but took their dividend out of his estate in insolvency upon the full amount of the note. Now, the contention of the learned counsel for the defendants before us was, that the defendants had a perfect right, in law, thus to retain the proceeds of the sale of the fish and to prove on Richardson's insolvency for the full amount of the note, upon the authority of ex parte English and American Bank[58], which the learned counsel contended was conclusively in his favor upon this point.\nThat case affirmed a rule well established in bankruptcy, that a creditor who has a security from a third person, or a security which belongs jointly to the bankrupt and a third person, can prove in the bankruptcy for the whole debt without giving up the security. Upon the authority of this rule the learned counsel relied in justification of the defendants having (notwithstanding the sale of the fish in 1878) proved for the whole amount of the note. But neither the case, nor the rule affirmed thereby, asserts a right in a creditor, after realizing upon the security, and so reducing the debt by the amount realized, to prove for the whole debt. Moreover, it is obvious that the rule relied upon applies to a security placed in the hands of the bankrupt's creditor by way of security for the debt of the bankrupt, and it is equally obvious that such was not the state of the facts in the present case. The fish are clearly shewn to have become the property of Richardson in November, 1877, while they were in the possession of the defendants in the only right, whatever it was, by which they ever had possession of them; they continued to be the property of Richardson in virtue of his purchase from Shaw, the owner of them, until Richardson's insolvency on the 4th March, 1878, when they became the property of his assignee, subject, it may be, after the 6th March, when the note became due, assuming the fish not to have previously been reduced into the actual possession of Richardson or his assignee, to a right in the nature of the right of stoppage in transitu in Shaw, who might, in such case, if he had pleased, have given, but he did not, notice to the defendants not to permit Richardson or his assignee to have possession of the fish without payment to Shaw of the balance of the purchase money. As matter of fact Shaw has never interfered in any manner in the matter. He has never claimed or asserted any right of detention of the fish, nor has he offered any impediment to his vendee receiving them, but they were never placed in the defendants' hands by way of security for any debt due by Richardson to the defendants, so that the rule referred to has no application to the case. Moreover, this claim, now apparently for the first time asserted, upon the authority of the above rule, is quite inconsistent with the allegation in Lewis's affidavit to the effect that he and his partner had no security whatever for Richardson's liability to them upon the note, and also quite inconsistent with the position taken by the defendants at the trial, and upon which they wholly rested their defence to the action.\nTo the plaintiff's declaration, which is for the wrongful conversion by the defendants of the property of the plaintiff, as assignee of Richardson, they pleaded not guilty, and that the goods were not, nor was any of them, the plaintiff's as such assignee as alleged. This latter plea enabled them to dispute the title of the assignee, and also of Richardson, by setting up the title in themselves or in a third person, and the whole contention of the defendants at the trial, and which is repeated in the third paragraph of the appellants factum, was, that Richardson had never any property in the fish, for that they were consigned by Shaw to the defendants as his factors, with authority to them to sell to cover certain advances made by them to Shaw, and to apply the proceeds to Shaw's credit, and that in virtue of this title and authority they sold the fish, and that in fact they had no knowledge that Richardson claimed any interest in the fish until after his insolvency; and that they, the defendants, as stated by Lewis in his evidence, gave no authority to Shaw to sell them. Upon this title, asserted to be in the defendants themselves, the defendants wholly rested their defence to the plaintiff's action at the trial, and at the close of the plaintiff's case a nonsuit was moved upon the ground of the alleged insufficiency of the evidence to shew Shaw's ownership of the fish, so as to entitle him to sell them to Richardson; this objection being overruled, the defendant Lewis was called as a witness for the defence, when he asserted title as above stated. He said among other things that the defendants received a bill of lading with the fish; but no such document was produced. To that, if, as seems to have been implied, its contents would have supported the defendants claim, its non production constituted a material flaw in defendants' evidence. Upon cross-examination moreover Lewis stated that until the day before, \"he had no knowledge of what fish was sold to Richardson, or that it extended beyond two cargoes,\" (not comprising the fish in question); and the defendant Troop admitted that the defendants had no special agreement with Shaw as to the fish in question. In view of this evidence and of the evidence given on the part of the plaintiff, which, if believed, was abundantly sufficient to shew that the fish were in truth Shaw's, stored only by him with the defendants, and that Shaw sold them to Richardson in Nov. 1877, whose property they then became and thenceforth remained, it is not at: all surprising, as it appears to me, that the learned Chief Justice-before whom-the cage was tried, came to the conclusion that the defendants wholly failed to prove the title to the fish-and their proceeds which they had set up; and rendered a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe defendant show raise a point, that inasmuch as the learned Chief Justice has allowed them a sum for storage and-insurance, which does not constitute matter of set-off the effect of\u201e his so allowing this sum is to recognize a right of lien in the defendants, which existing is a defence to the action; but the defendants, not only never before the commencement of the action nor at th\u00e8 trial set up any claim of lien, but such a claim, if set up, Would have been inconsistent with the position upon which they rested their defence at the trial:; and the learned Chief Justice, having allowed them for storage and insurance as against Richardson from, the time of his purchasing, cannot give to the defendants a right to appeal against a verdict which gives them a benefit to which, in strict law, they were not entitled.\nThe defendants now also attempt to set up, as another ground of appeal, a point which was not made a ground of objection at the trial and which is also inconsistent with the defence then relied upon, and which, not having been taken at the trial, could not now be entertained; if there were anything in it viz.: that admitting the fish to have been the property of Shaw in November, 187*7, and to have been then sold by him to Richardson, whose property they then became and thenceforth continued to be, still that, upon non-payment of his note by Richardson when it became due on the 6th of March, 1878, inasmuch as Richardson had not then obtained actual possession of the fish, the defendants can resist this action by setting up, under the doctrine of the jus tertii, the right of Shaw to have prevented Richardson's assignee obtaining actual possession of the fish without payment of the balance of the purchase money. It is certainly true that the defend ants, although acknowledged wrongdoers, might, to an action for conversion, under the plea that \"the goods were not the plaintiff's as alleged,\" prove the property in the goods to be in Shaw or in any other person, and not in the plaintiff; but no case has been cited to us to show that, to an action like the present, brought by the person in whom the title and property in the goods are, a wrongdoer can resist the right of such owner of the goods converted, to recover, by setting up a right in the nature of a right of stoppage in transitu, which a third person might have had it in his power to exercise, but did not exercise, of interfering to prevent the vendee of the goods (who although by the terms of sale entitled to have had, had not yet obtained actual possession of the goods) from receiving such actual possession until he should pay a balance of purchase money; nor has any case been cited to shew that a person who had received possession of the goods only as storekeeper for the vendor could, without any authority from the vendor, sell the goods and apply the proceeds to his own benefit, although in satisfaction of a debt claimed to be due by the vendor, without subjecting himself to an action at the suit of the vendee owner, for wrongfully depriving such owner of his property. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say that no such point having been made at the trial it cannot now be entertained.\nIn fine, the sale of the fish by the defendants was made by them, and, so far as appears in evidence, without any right whatever, when the fish were the property of the plaintiff as assignee of Richardson; and the defendants having failed to establish the only title asserted by them in justification of that sale, such sale was wrongful to the plaintiff, as such assignee, who, for anything established in evidence, had as against the defendants a right to the immediate possession of the fish which, together with the right of property, is sufficient to maintain this action. There is no evidence whatever that Shaw ever claimed to have had any right to dispute the right of Richardson and his assignee to the possession of the fish; that he had such a right is an assumption merely of the defendants, and I do not think that the defendants, who sold Richardson's property without any right so to do, and without any direction or authority from Shaw so to do, can shelter themselves under an assumed right of detention of the fish in Shaw, which right Shaw has never claimed or asserted, and so relieve themselves, as a defence to this action, from the consequences of having without any legal right sold Richardson's property and applied the proceeds to their own use The;~point that 36 barrels of the fish were sold after the action brought was never made, and the court is not called upon to suggest it; but the rest of the fish was sold before action and a demand and refusal of the whole before action was also proved, and no claim of lien on them then or at the trial made. In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs, and judgment entered for the plaintiff on the verdict rendered in his favor.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Thompson & Graham.\nSolicitor for respondent; John M.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of right\u2014Non-liability of the Crown on Parliamentary Printing Contract\u2014Departmental Printing contract\u2014Mutuality.\nH., in his capacity of \"clerk of the Joint Committee of both Houses on Printing,\" advertized for tenders for the printing, furnishing the printing paper and the binding required for the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. The tender of the suppliants was accepted by the Joint Committee and by both Houses of Parliament by adoption of the committee's report, and a contract was executed between the suppliants and H. in his said capacity.\nThe suppliants, by their petition, contended that the tender and acceptance constituted a contract between them and Her Majesty, and that they were entitled to do the whole of the printing required for the Parliament of Canada, but had not been given the same, and they claimed compensation by way of damages.\nHeld, (reversing the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court) that the Parliamentary printing was a matter connected with the internal economy of the Senate and House of Commons over which the Executive Government had no control; and that the Crown was no party to the contract with the suppliants and could not be held responsible for a breach of it.\nUnder 32 & 33 Vic., ch 7, which provides that the printing, binding and other like work required for the several departments of the Government shall be done and furnished under contracts to be entered into under authority of the Governor in Council after advertisement for tenders, the Under Secretary of State advertized for tenders for the printing \"required by the several departments of the Government.\" The suppliants tendered for such printing, the specifications annexed to the tender, which were supplied by the Government, containing various provisions as to the manner of performing the work and giving of security. The tenders were accepted by the Governor in Council, and an indenture was executed between the suppliants and Her Majesty by which the suppliants agreed to perform and execute, &c., \"all jobs or lots of printing for the several departments of the Government of Canada of reports, &c., of every description and kind soever coming within the denomination of Departmental printing, and all the work and services connected therewith and appertaining thereto, as set forth in the said specificaton hereunto annexed, in such numbers and quantities as may be specified in the several requisitions which may be made upon them for that purpose from time to time by and on behalf of said several respective departments.\" Part of the Departmental printing having been given to others, the suppliants, by their petition, claimed compensation by way of damages, contending that they were entitled to the whole of said printing.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court,) that having regard to the whole scope and nature of the transaction, the statute, the advertisement, the tender, the acceptance and the contract, there was a clear intention shown that the contractors should have all the printing that should be required by the several departments of the Government, and that the contract was not a unilateral contract but a binding mutual agreement. (Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting).\nAppeal from a judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada on a demurrer.\nThe contracts for breach of which the respondents filed a petition of right, and the pleadings are fully set out in the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court and in the judgments on this appeal.\nThe Crown was represented in the Exchequer Court and in the Supreme Court by Mr. Lash, Q.C., and the suppliants by Mr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. Gormully.\nThe following authorities were relied on by counsel in addition to those cited in the judgments hereinafter given:\u2014Kilbourne v. Thompson[1]; Chesterfield & Mid. Coll. Co. v. Hawkin[2]; L. Southampton v. Brown[3]; Aspdin v. Austin[4]; Dunn v. Sayles[5]; Great N. R. Co. v. Witham[6]; Burton v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[7]; Price v. Moulton[8]; Morgan v. Pike[9]; Broom's Constitutional Law[10]; Macbath v. Haldimand[11]; Beckham v. Drake[12]; Edmunds v. Bushell[13]; and Clifford v. Watts[14].\nThe following is the judgment of\u2014\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis suit was commenced by a petition of right in which the suppliants set out two agreements by which they became contractors with the Government, the first for the printing, furnishing the printing paper, and the binding required for the Parliament for the period of five years from the 1st day of January, 1875\u2014the second for 'the printing of the Canada Gazette, the statutes, orders in council and other books, pamphlets, blank books, forms, blanks and other printing required by the several departments of the Government and for which the tenders on the printed form issued by the Government and required to be used are headed \"Departmental Printing, &c.' The first agreement is dated on the 7th July, 1874, and was executed by the suppliants of the one part, and by Henry Hartney of the other part, and in it he is alleged to execute it in his capacity as clerk of the joint committee of both Houses of Parliament of Canada. The petition shows that the agreement was prepared by the officers of the said joint committee, by whom the tender of the suppliants was accepted and which acceptance was ratified by both Houses of Parliament, and that the advertisement for tenders was signed by Henry Hartney as \"clerk joint committee of both houses on printing by order,\" and is dated: \"Department of Printing of Parliament, Ottawa, April, 15th, 1874.\" The agreement is with Henry Hartney in his representative or subordinate character as such clerk and his successors in office. By it, the suppliants became \"bound to perform in a workmanlike manner all the work and furnish all the materials for the service of both Houses of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada mentioned in the annexed specification as being to be performed and furnished by them (the suppliants, called the party of the first part), at the places and times, and within the period and upon the terms and conditions therein specified.\" The agreement sets forth that the suppliants instead of giving the ordinary security for the fulfilment of their contract had paid $5,000 to Henry Hartney to deposit in his name in the Bank of Montreal, on account of the suppliants, under the condition, that if they performed their contract, the same, at the end of five years would be returned to them \"otherwise the \"same shall belong to Her Majesty the Queen and be \"paid over to the Receiver-General by the said Henry \"Hartney for the public uses of the Dominion, the interest \"to be paid to suppliants, provided they perform\" their contract.\"\n\"The suppliants, in their petition, complain that although they, expecting to have all the work of the printing provided for in the agreement and specification given them to perform, and which they had become bound to execute \"expended large sums of money in procuring the men and in purchasing and in setting up the printing presses, ruling and cutting machines, type and other plant and materials necessary and requisite for the punctual and prompt execution of the said printing services,\" and which they were always willing and ready and prepared to execute, large portions of the same were not given to them but to others to execute, by which they have lost, to that extent, the benefits and profits of their contract, and pray that they may be awarded such reasonable compensation in damages as they may be shewn to be entitled to. To this claim set forth more fully in the petition, the Attorney-General demurred and assigns for causes of demurrer.\n1st. That the petition \"discloses no claim against Her Majesty capable of enforcement by petition of right.\"\n2nd. Substantially that Her Majesty is not accountable for the agreement signed by Hartney as clerk of the committee \"on the printing of Parliament.\"\n3rd. That there is no liability under the agreement for any loss sustained by the suppliants because of the giving of parts of the work contracted for by the suppliants to others.\nTaking together the three causes of demurrer, they amount to two propositions:\n1st. That under the agreement a petition of right cannot be maintained, because it purports to have been entered into by the two houses of Parliament as principals, and therefore the only redress, if any, in case of a, breach, is by an application to those bodies, and\n2nd. That even if a Petition of Right could be maintained for a breach of the agreement, there was none in this case, for the giving of portions of the work to others did not constitute a breach.\nAs to the first of these two propositions I have already and very recently given a decision. In the case of McFarlane et al. v. Queen[15], I held that in all cases of contract with the Government of Canada an action by petition of right was maintainable where an action for the same cause would lie against a private party. My judgment was founded on the law in England. and I cited for the position taken Feathers v. The Queen[16], and I have not since had any reason to change my opinion.\nI will next consider whether it was in reality a contract by and with the government?\nThe agreement, as already stated, was entered into by Henry Hartney as clerk of the joint committee of both houses of parliament, by the direction and under the authority of that committee, representing as they did the Senate and House of Commons jointly, by whom they were appointed and authorized for that purpose, and the whole proceeding was done with the sanction and approval of the government It was founded on the estimates, moved in the House of Commons at the instance of the government by its proper officer, the Minister of Finance. The agreement provides that in case of the failure by the suppliants to perform the contract, the five thousand dollars, to be lodged in the Bank of Montreal as security, should belong to Her Majesty the Queen and be paid to the Receiver General for the public uses of the dominion. By the arrangement, at the instance of the government and the annual appropriation acts, the payments for the service were provided to come out of the public funds of the dominion. It was wholly in the public interest, and the amount to be forfeited by the suppliants, in case of failure in their contract, was to be paid to the proper officer and form part of the same public funds from which the payment for the service was provided to be drawn.\nI think for these and other reasons not necessary to be stated that Henry Hartney, acting as clerk of the joint committee, had sufficient authority to bind the government as fully as if the agreement had been executed for the government by one of its members.\nThe remaining one of the two propositions I will now consider.\nAdmitting the agreement to have been binding as a government contract, for which an action by petition of right is maintainable, it is still contended the suppliants have no cause of action as, under it, the government was not obliged to give the whole or any particular part or portion of it to the suppliants. That contention necessarily includes the proposition that although the contract should, as it in fact did, involve the payment of some fifty or sixty thousand dollars for the service it provided for, and the necessity of the expenditure of thousands of dollars in the procuring the appliances and means to perform it, the Government was not bound to give the work agreed for to the suppliants beyond such part of it as it might from time to time think proper to give.\nI cannot conclude that such was the intention of the Government, or of the two Houses of Parliament, or of those acting under them, when provision was made for the service, and the agreement entered into. If such was the intention, I must say that some intimation of it should be given to the public who were asked to tender for and provide the means for performing the service, or notice of it given to the party or parties whose tender or tenders was or were accepted, before being asked to sign an agreement \"for the printing, furnishing the printing paper and the binding required for the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada.\"\nUnder an agreement founded on the acceptance of a tender, the contractor would be bound to perform the whole work under the three classes named that was or should \"be required for the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada.\" It is not only in the advertisement calling for tenders, but in the tender of the suppliants and the agreement that the service is stated to be for the three classes of work named \"required\" for the Parliament. It is therefore for all the work necessary for or needed by the two Houses. The word must be so construed and not to mean only work to be done on their requisition. It means not a part or portion of it, but the whole of it, as fully as if it had been expressly stated. But it is quite unnecessary to depend upon that construction, for in the printed tender of the suppliants, which was required to be on the blank form furnished them, as provided in the advertisement for the tenders under the heading \"Conditions of the contract for printing,\" it is provided, that \"the whole of the printing will be given to one contractor and tenders will be calculated upon the whole work to be done and not in portions;\" and the agreement provides that the suppliants should perform \"all the work and furnish all the materials for the service of both Houses\" mentioned in the specification annexed thereto. The latter covers in the detail the whole of the work for the service provided for in the general terms of the agreement. It is in my opinion too palpable and plain that the agreement binding on both parties was not for a part but for the whole of the service, and that the one party was as fully bound to employ the other to perform the whole of it, as the latter were bound to perform it. If it was intended not to give the whole to the suppliants, why should we find as we do such provisions, as I have quoted, in the tender and agreement? If such was the intention, we should on the contrary require to find, as we fail to do in any of the documents referred to, express provision to give effect to it.\nBetween private parties this conclusion is irresistible, and when we are dealing with the matter of a contract I know of no law or reason why a different rule should be applied to a contract of the Government which in my opinion should be considered as fully binding.\nTo the remaining portion of the petition, the same causes of demurrer are assigned as the first and third grounds to the previous part of the petition, and with which I have just dealt. I need not repeat therefore, the views I have expressed.\nThe suppliants' claim, under the second contract, is, in my opinion, fully as strong, if not stronger, than that founded on the first, as to the causes of demurrer now under consideration, in every respect but in one, to which I will hereafter refer. The agreement secondly set out in the petition is for what is known as and was styled in the schedule annexed to it \"Departmental Printing,\" and it is alleged in it to have been entered into under the provisions of the Act 32 and 33 Vic. c. 7, which amongst other things provides \"that the printing, binding and other work to \"be done under the superintendence of the Queen's \"Printer, except as is hereinafter mentioned, be done \"and furnished under contracts to be entered into under \"the authority of the Governor in Council, in such \"form and for such time as he shall appoint.\"\nThe agreement recites the fact of the acceptance of the suppliants' tender by the Governor in Council.\nIt is alleged in the petition that no Order in Council was passed under the provision of that section, and if that be the fact, the giving out of the portions of the work to others as complained of was to all intents and purposes a violation of the Act; but although it was so, the suppliants cannot, for that reason alone, complain. If they, however, had the right under their agreement to claim that the whole of the work should have been given to them, it will not help the case on the other side, if the breach of the agreement is found also to be a violation of the law.\nFor the reasons given in regard to the issues of law, as to the first agreement referred to, with those I have added, I think the suppliants were entitled under the second, now under consideration, to claim that the contract was for the whole of the work referred to in the schedule attached to it, unless the wording of the first paragraph requires a construction that would vary it.\nThat paragraph provides that the suppliants shall from time to time and at all times during the prescribed five years\nWill faithfully and promptly do, perform or execute, or cause to be done, performed or executed, all jobs or lots of printing for the several departments of the government of Canada, of reports, pamphlets, circulars and blank forms of every description and kind soever coming within the denomination of Departmental Printing and all the work and services connected therewith and appertaining thereto, as set forth in the specification hereunto annexed, in such numbers and quantities as may be specified in the several requisitions which may be made upon them for that purpose from time to time, by and on behalf of the said several departments.\nThe question is, do the words I have italicized qualify and limit the general contract shown by the preceding general statement of the service, so as to limit the contract to such parts or portions of it for which requisitions were provided to be made? I cannot put that construction on the contract, when taking into consideration the object in view of either party in entering into it. We must in construing contracts at all doubtful, by taking the objects in view, and looking at the surrounding circumstances and the bearing of the whole contract, ascertain the intention of the contracting parties.\nThe Act referred to provided that work should be let by tender, and we find that provision was made for the whole service and included in one tender, made and accepted for the performance of it, by the Governor in Council, without any reservation or qualification. I feel bound to conclude that the government as well as the suppliants intended the contract to cover and include the whole service; and that the words I have italicized were inserted to bind the contractors to furnish the \"numbers\" and \"quantities\" called for by the requisitions. There was in my opinion no necessity for adding those words, as I think the departments were the judges of what was required, but they may have been added for greater caution to prevent any question as to the numbers and quantities to be furnished.\nI am of opinion that these added words do not limit the contract, and therefore that the suppliants were entitled to claim that the whole work should have been given to them.\nIt is generally understood that there is often private and confidential printing required by a government which might not be considered expedient to submit to a contractor for the general service, but in giving the general contract the agreement should provide for such an exception. Otherwise I cannot see how it could be taken from the general contractor without compensation for its loss, as the same rules are applicable to a government as to a private contract, although we find it sometimes not so considered.\nEntertaining the views I do, my judgment must be for the suppliants and the demurrer will be overruled with costs.\"\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada the following judgments were delivered: \u2014\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThis is an appeal on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, from the judgment of Mr. Justice Henry in the Exchequer Court, in the matter of the petition of right of Mac Lean, Roger & Co. against Her Majesty, in which the suppliants claimed damages for the breach of two contracts: one with respect to the printing, furnishing the printing paper and the binding required for the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada,\" the other with respect to printing required by the several departments of the Government. These contracts are entirely distinct and separate, one from the other. As to the first, the petition alleges that:\n1. On or about the 15th day of April, A.D. 1874, there appeared and was published in several newspapers printed and published in the Dominion of Canada an advertisement in the words and figures following:\n\"Tenders addressed to the undersigned in a sealed envelope, \"marked Tenders for Printing, Paper or Binding (as the case \"may be), will be received until Monday, the 11 th day of May \"next, after which day no Tender will be received, for the \"Printing, furnishing the Printing Paper, and the Binding \"required for the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada.\n\"No Tender will be received except on the blank form, \"which can be had on application to the undersigned, and \"from whom all information may be obtained.\n\"The committee do not bind themselves to accept the \"lowest or any Tender.\n\"By order,\nHenry Hartney,\n\"Clerk, Joint Committee of both Houses on Printing.\n\"Department of Printing of Parliament,\n\"Ottawa, April 15th, 1874.\"\nThat in pursuance of such notice, suppliants tendered for the said printing in the manner prescribed; one of the conditions being that, \"The whole of the Printing will be given to one Contractor, and tenders will be calculated upon the whole work to be done, and not in portions.\" That such tender was duly accepted by the Joint Committee of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada on the printing of Parliament, and was afterwards duly accepted by both Houses of Parliament, by the adoption of the report of said committee, and the said tender and acceptance thereof suppliants submit thereby created a valid contract between Her Majesty and the suppliants; that at the request of the officers of the said Joint Committee acting on behalf of the said Joint Committee, suppliants executed an agreement with respect to said printing which is set out at length and is an\nAgreement made on the 7th day of July, A.D. 1874, Between MacLean, Roger & Co., that is to say, Alexander MacLean and John Charles Roger, both of the city of Ottawa, county of Carleton, province of Ontario, and Dominion of Canada, and doing business in the said city as printers, under the said name and firm as co-partners, of the first part and Henry Hartney of the said city of Ottawa, Esquire, in his capacity as Clerk of the Joint Committee of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada, on the printing of Parliament, of the second part:\nAnd witnesseth that the the said party of the first part, hath agreed, and doth hereby agree with the said party of the second part, and his successors in office respectively, to perform in a workmanlike manner, all the work and furnish all the materials for the service of both Houses of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, mentioned in the annexed specification as being to be performed and furnished by him at the places and times, and within the periods, and upon the terms and conditions therein specified for and during the space and term of five years, to be computed from the 1st day of January, 1875, and fully to be completed and ended on the 31st day of December, 1879, with the right nevertheless to the said party of the second part, and his successors in office, at the option and by the direction of the two \"Houses of Parliament\" of Canada, to continue the contract during the further period of five years from the last day aforesaid; and in all things to conform to, fulfil and abide by the said specification to the full and entire satisfaction of the party of the second part, and his successors in office, and that the said party of the second part in his capacity aforesaid, and for his successors in office, has promised and agreed and does hereby promise and agree to pay the said party of the first part for the said work and materials performed for and furnished to the respective Houses of Parliament at the prices, and in the manner, and at the times, and according to the terms and conditions in the said specification mentioned, and in all things to conform to, fulfil, and abide by the said specification.\nThe agreement then recites that in lieu of finding sureties for the due performance of the contract, the suppliants deposited in hands of Hartney $5,000 to be made a special deposit in Bank of Montreal as security for faithful performance of conditions of contract, and on completion of same at end of five years, such sum to be returned to suppliants, otherwise the same shall belong to Her Majesty the Queen and be paid over to the Receiver General by said Hartney for the public uses of the Dominion; in meantime, unless suppliants shall fail to perform contract, the interest allowed by the bank on said deposit to be paid over to them as received by Hartney;\u2014and it was further agreed that should suppliants fail to perform contract \"to the satisfaction of the joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada on the printing of Parliament, such joint committee may cancel this contract, and their resolution to that effect shall cancel the same without prejudice to the forfeit of the $5,000, &c.\"\nThis agreement was signed and sealed by the suppliants and Hartney. The specification provided that:\nPayments to be made, as the work progresses, by the Clerk of the Joint Committee on Printing, but, in all cases, 20 per cent. of the amount due the contractors will be retained by the clerk of the committee till the whole of the work pertaining to each session is satisfactorily completed.\nAnd that \"the printer to be subject on all points to the \"Clerk of the Joint Committee on Printing.\"\nThe suppliants contend that the tender and acceptance constituted a contract between them and Her Majesty, under which they claim that they were entitled to do the whole of the printing required for the Parliament of Canada, and allege that this obligation was broken and Parliamentary printing given out to be done by others, whereby they were unjustly deprived of the profits they would have derived from the execution thereof by themselves, that moneys necessary for the payment of the whole of said printing, works and services required for the Parliament of Canada were from time to time duly voted by Parliament, and they claim compensation by way of damages. To this petition the Attorney-General demurred on the following grounds:\n1. Because the same discloses no claim against Her Majesty capable of enforcement by petition of right.\n2. Because it appears that such contract was made with one Henry Hartney in his capacity as clerk of the joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada on the printing of Parliament, and no action upon such contract can be enforced against Her Majesty by petition of right.\n3. Because it does not appear that Her Majesty contracted with the suppliants that they should do all the Parliamentary printing which might be required by Parliament, or that Her Majesty incurred any liability towards the suppliants because Parliamentary printing was done by others than the suppliants.\nAnd as to all the remaining portion of the suppliants' petition Her Majesty's said Attorney General doth demur in law thereto.\n1. Because it discloses no claim against Her Majesty capable of enforcement by petition of right.\n2. Because it does not appear that Her Majesty contracted with the suppliants that they should do all the Departmental printing which might be required or that Her Majesty incurred any liability towards the suppliants because Departmental printing was done by others than the suppliants.\nOn behalf of Her Majesty, I submit that the suppliants' petition should be dismissed with costs.\nThis demurrer was argued before Mr. Justice Henry, who overruled the same. From this judgment the present appeal was taken.\nIt is in my opinion quite impossible to sustain the judgment appealed from. Her Majesty is no party to this agreement directly or indirectly. The Parliamentary printing was matter connected with the internal economy of the Senate and House of Commons over which the Executive Government had no control. The Crown could neither dictate to the joint committee of both Houses, nor interfere, nor deal with any contract entered into by them or by their clerk under their authority. The Crown neither authorized the execution of any contract for the work contemplated, nor in any way authorized the doing of the work to be performed under this contract. The Crown neither employed the suppliants to do this work nor entered into any contract in reference thereto. The suppliants were in no way bound to the Crown or, in respect to this contract, subject to its control. The Crown could neither put an end to the contract, nor enforce it, nor in any way interfere with its execution. This contract gave the Crown no right of action against the suppliants, nor the suppliants against the Crown; in other words, the Crown was no party to the contract, and, therefore, cannot possibly on any principle I can conceive, be held responsible for a breach of it. I have examined 27 Vic., ch. 27, \"An Act respecting the internal economy of the House of Commons and for other purposes,\" to which we were referred, but I can find nothing in that Act to bind the Crown by a contract such as this or to render the Crown in any way liable for its breach.\nAs to the other contract it is of a very different character. The 32 and 83 Vic. ch. 7, provides by sec. 1 for the appointment of a Queen's printer. Sec. 2 prescribes his duties. Sec. 3, what documents shall be printed in the Canada Gazette. Sec. 4, in what cases copies of the Gazette shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence. Sec. 5 defines the powers of the Governor in Council, as to the Gazette, and secs. 6 and 7 provide for the printing, and are as follows:\nWhereas it is by \"An Act respecting the office of Queen's Printer and the Public Printing,\" passed by the parliament of Canada in its session held in the 32nd and 33rd years of Her Majesty's reign, amongst other things in effect enacted that the printing, binding and other like work to be done under the superintendence of the Queen's Printer shall, except as is thereinafter mentioned; be done and furnished under contracts to be entered into under the authority of the Governor in Council in such form, and for such time as he shall appoint after such public notice or advertisement for tenders as he may deem advisable, and the lowest tenders received from parties of whose skill, resources, and of the sufficiency of whose sureties for the due performance of the contracts the Governor in Council shall be satisfied, shall be accepted.\nThe 7th sec. of the Act provides that \"the Governor in Council may from time to time by Order in Council authorize for reasons to be stated in such orders, cause printing and binding for the public service to be done without tender, and such orders in Council and the expenditure under them shall be laid at its then next session.\"\nThe petition alleges that:\n4. On or about the said 15th day of April, A.D. 1874, there appeared and was published in several newspapers printed and published in the Dominion of Canada, an advertisement in the words and figures following:\nTENDERS FOR PRINTING, &c.\nSealed tenders addressed to the Secretary of State, Ottawa, and endorsed respectively \"Tenders for Printing Paper,\" \"Tenders for Printing,\" and \"Tenders for Binding,\" will be received until noon of Monday, the 11th day of May next, for the performance during a term of five years from the 1st day of October next, of the following services.\n(1). Furnishing Printing Paper for the printing of the Canada Gazette, the Statutes and Orders in Council; and for Pamphlets and other Jobs required by the several Departments of the Government.\n(2). Printing the Canada Gazette, the Statutes and Orders in Council, and other Books, Pamphlets, Blank Books, Forms, Blanks, and other Printing required by the several Departments of the Government.\n(3). Binding the Statutes and Orders in Council, and such other Books, or Blank Books, and such other Binding, Map Mounting, &c., as may be required by the several Departments of the Government.\nBlank Forms of Tender and Specifications will be furnished on application to the undersigned on and after the 20th April, instant.\nEdouard J. Langevin,\nUnder Secretary of State.\nDepartment Secretary of State,\nOttawa, 15th April, 1874.\n5. In pursuance of the said notices in the fourth paragraph hereof set forth your suppliants tendered for the printing of the Canada Gazette, the Statutes and Orders in Council, and other Books, Pamphlets, Blank Books, Forms, Blanks and other printing required by the several Departments of the Government, the tenders of your suppliants for the said printing being in the words and figures following:\nThe first for departmental printing, which, after a schedule of prices, contained a specification in which inter alia it is provided that:\nThe contractor must be prepared to deliver work at short notice, as may be frequently required.\nHe will be expected to use the newest styles of type, and keep the work up to the standard of first-class workmanship.\nGood and sufficient security in the sum of five thousand dollars by a bond of a guarantee company, approved by the Government, will be required from the contractor for the due fulfilment of his contract.\nThe second for printing of the Statutes and Orders in Council, with a schedule of prices and a specification which contained inter alia these stipulations:\nThe Statutes must be delivered by the printer at the rate of, at least, six sheets, or 96 pages per week from the date of delivery of copy therefor.\nThe contractor will be required to provide safe storage room for the law paper, and will be responsible therefor while in his keeping.\nTwo per cent. will be allowed for waste and proofs on the number of sheets ordered to be printed.\nGood and sufficient security, in the sum of five thousand dollars (by bond of a guarantee company to be approved by the Government), will be required from the contractor, for the due fulfilment of his contract.\nThe third, for printing the Canada Gazette, with a schedule of prices and a specification containing inter alia:\nA complete classified list of persons receiving the Gazette will be made and kept by the contractor under instructions from time to time furnished by the Queen's Printer; and he will be held responsible for the loss of any number through insufficient address or fastening.\nThe contractors must be in a position to complete the Gazette whatever may be its size, and have it delivered or posted on the day of its issue.\nTwo-and-a-half per cent. will be allowed for waste on the number of sheets of the Gazette ordered to be printed. The contractor will furnish safe storage for at least two months' supply of Gazette paper, for which he will be responsible to the Government.\nGood and sufficient security, in the sum of five thousand dollars by bond of a guarantee company, approved by the Government, will be required from the contractors for the due fulfilment of their contract.\nThe petition then alleges that\u2014\nThe said tenders of your suppliants were duly accepted by His Excellency the then Governor-in-Council as prescribed by the statutes in that behalf, and on or about the 5th day of August, A. D. 1874, due notice of such acceptance was given by the officers of Your Majesty acting on behalf of Your Majesty to your suppliants, and thereby the said tenders of your suppliants in this paragraph set forth, and the acceptance thereof as aforesaid your suppliants submit constituted a valid contract binding on your Majesty and your suppliants.\n6. At the request of the officers of Your Majesty acting on Your Majesty's behalf, your suppliants executed an indenture with respect to said printing.\nIn the words and figures set out in petition.\nThis purports to be an indenture made the 1st day of October, A.D. 1874, between Alexander MacLean and John C. Roger, both of the city of Ottawa, printers, thereafter called the contractors of the first part and Her Majesty the Queen, of the second part, after reciting the 6th sec. of the 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 7, and after reciting that, \"whereas in pursuance thereof tenders were advertized for amongst other things the printing for the several Departments of the Government of Canada (commonly called the Departmental Printing,) for the term of five years to be reckoned and computed from the 1st day of Oct, 1874, and the Governor in Council has seen fit to accept a certain tender made for the performance of such service and work by the contractors.\" The indenture witnessed that\nIn consideration of the sums and prices for the several different descriptions of work, and services embraced in the said tender, to be done and performed by the \"Contractors,\" in accordance with, and at the respective rates and prices mentioned and expressed in the printed schedule and specification thereof hereunto annexed and marked A, and which is to be read and construed as part and parcel of these presents, as if the same were embodied therein, they, the \"Contractors,\" do hereby convenant, promise and agree to and with Her Majesty in manner, following, that is to say:\n1. That \"the Contractors\" shall, and will, from time to time, and at all times during the said term of five years, so to be computed as aforesaid, well, truly, faithfully and promptly do, perform and execute, or cause, or procure to be done, performed or executed all jobs or lots of printing for the several Departments of the Government of Canada, of Reports, Pamphlets, Circulars and Blank Forms of every description and kind soever coming within the denomination of Departmental Printing, and all the work and services connected therewith, and appertaining thereto, as set forth in the said specification hereunto annexed, in such numbers and quantities as may be specified in the several requisitions which may be made upon them for that purpose from time to time by and on behalf of the said several respective Departments. \"The Contractors\" being in all cases furnished the necessary supplies of paper and they furnishing the necessary inks for the purpose; such jobs or lots of work to be executed and performed in a good and workmanlike manner, in strict accordance with the terms of the said schedule and specification in every respect, and to the entire satisfaction of the Queen's Printer, and to be delivered by the said \"Contractors\" to the said several departments or the Queen's Printer on their behalf, as he or they may direct, within a reasonable period after receipt of the requisitions therefor respectively.\nThe next paragraph provided that if it should appear that the execution of the work under this contract was not carried out in a satisfactory manner, the Secretary of State might authorize the Queen's Printer to judge whether work is being done in a workmanlike manner, and in a proportionally forward state of progress, &c., and if Queen's Printer should come to a conclusion it is not, power is given him to require contractors to put on additional workmen, &c.\nParagraph 3 provides:\nThat in the event of any portion of the said work (contemplated by this contract) not being delivered and performed in a perfectly workmanlike manner, 'the contractors' shall on a requisition for that purpose from the department of the Government which shall have required such job of work to be done, or of the Queen's Printer on its behalf, cause the same to be re-executed and delivered within such period to the satisfaction of the Queen's Printer; the department so requiring the work to be done shall be at liberty if it shall be thought the exigencies of the public service require it, to employ other parties to do such work, and 'The contractors' shall pay to or for the use of Her Majesty, as well the amount which the paper shall have been used in such rejected work shall have cost Her Majesty (such amount to be ascertained and stated by the Queen's Printer), as also any sum which shall have been paid to such other parties for such work in excess of the respective prices therefor, embraced in the said schedule, and any such sums shall be recoverable against 'The contractors' as and in the nature of liquidated damages.\n4 Provides that the contractors shall not assign or sublet without assent of Governor in Council.\n5 Provides where notices on contractors may be served, and section 6 provides where and how the Governor in Council may require that the Departmental Printing may be taken out of the hands of the contractors and given to others, and that the Governor in Council may in such case declare contract rescinded, and the same shall be from thenceforth treated as null and void. To the contract is annexed schedule A as to prices, and a specification which requires inter alia that\nThe contractor must be prepared to deliver work at short notice as may be frequently required. He will be expected to use the newest styles of type, and keep the work up to the standard of first-class workmanship.\nGood and sufficient security in the sum of 5,000 dollars by bond of a guarantee company approved by the Government, will be required from the contractor for the due fulfilment of his contract.\nThat the indenture was prepared by the officers of Her Majesty and was presented by said officers for execution. That from inquiries at the several departments of the government and from a perusal of public accounts, the suppliants believed there would be printing, works and services of great magnitude, and in order to execute same punctually and promptly expended large sums of money in procuring men and purchasing and setting up the printing presses, ruling and cutting machines, type and other plant and material necessary and requisite for the punctual and prompt execution of such printing services and works.\nThe suppliants readiness and willingness to do all Departmental printing and punctually and properly perform their part of the contract, and were always ready and willing to perform\u2014\nThe said contracts and agreements on their part, yet the officers of your Majesty, acting on behalf of your Majesty, did not and would not observe or perform the said contracts and agroements, and broke the said contracts and agreements in this, that they did not and would not allow or permit your suppliants to do, execute and perform the whole of the printing required by the Parliament of Canada, and the whole of the printing of the said other Books, Pamphlets, Blank Books, Forms, Blanks, and other printing required by the several Departments of the Government of Canada during the periods embraced in the said respective tenders; but on the contrary, the said officers employed other persons and companies to do, execute and perform, and other persons and companies did execute and perform portions of the said printing works and services without the consent of your suppliants and without any public tender for the said works and services, and without authority of any order of His Excellency the Governor in Council, and thereby your suppliants were prevented from earning and were deprived of the moneys, gains and profits which they would have derived and acquired from doing and executing the printing works and services done and executed by the said other persons and companies, and suffered divers other great losses and damages.\nThat no complaint whatever was ever made to suppliants that work required to be done was unsatisfactory; but on contrary, the work executed by suppliants was satisfactory to departments. Suppliants never directly or indirectly intimated that they were unwilling to do and perform work, but were ready and willing, &c.\nThat so soon as suppliants had notice that other persons and companies were executing departmental printing, they notified the Secretary of State in writing that giving such printing to others than your suppliants was a breach of the contract, and suppliants protested against a continuance of such a breach; notwithstanding such notice, large quantities of printing were given to several individuals, newspaper offices and companies which they submit should have been done and performed by them, by reason whereof they were unjustly deprived of the profits they would have derived therefrom. That the monies necessary for payment of whole of the said printing work has been duly voted by Parliament.\nSuppliants therefore prayed:\n1. That it may be declared that your suppliants were under and by virtue of the contracts and agreements aforesaid, entitled to do, execute and perform all the Parliamentary and Departmental Printing required to be done during the periods embraced in the said respective tenders, save and excepting such printing as was by Orders in Council and for the reasons stated in such orders authorized by the Governor in Council to be done without tender.\n2. That the sum of $200,000 or such sum as may be reasonable may be paid to your suppliants in compensation and by way of damages for the losses which have been occasioned to them by the breach of the contracts and agreements aforesaid, and the failure of Her Majesty the Queen to have all the Parliamentary and Departmental Printing, except as aforesaid, done and performed by your suppliants between the periods aforesaid.\n3. That an account may be taken of the quantity and amount of printing done by others than your suppliants and not authorized to be done as aforesaid by an Order of the Governor in Council as aforesaid.\n4. That the cost of the material provided for such printing may be ascertained, and that the cost of doing and performing such printing may be ascertained upon the scale, schedule or terms specified in the contracts aforesaid.\n5. That every excess over and above the cost of the material for such printing, and of doing and performing such printing as aforesaid may be regarded as profit and as the amount to be paid by Her Majesty the Queen to your suppliants as and for the estimated profits they would have derived from the printing aforesaid if it had been done and performed by them.\n6. That an account may be taken of the damages and loss sustained by your suppliants in preparing for and supplying the room, machinery and plant in expectation of having to do all the Parliamentary and Departmental Printing.\n7. That your suppliants may have such further and other relief in the premises as may seem meet.\n8. That your suppliants may be paid the cost of this petition.\nTo so much of the suppliants' petition as relates to the Departmental printing Her Majesty's Attorney General demurred upon the following grounds:\n1. Because it discloses no claim against Her Majesty capable of enforcement by petition of right.\n2. Because it does not appear that Her Majesty contracted with the suppliants that they should do all the Departmental printing which might be required, or that Her Majesty incurred any liability towards the suppliants because Departmental printing was done by others than the suppliants.\nThe demurrer was argued with the previous one before Mr. Justice Henry, who gave judgment overruling the demurrer.\nFrom this judgment Her Majesty appeals.\nIn construing this agreement I freely admit that we have no right to introduce any stipulation into the contract which the parties may have either from design or inadvertently omitted. I should not venture to add to the contract covenants or stipulations which have been purposely, unintentionally or inadvertently omitted, merely because I may deem them necessary to carry out what I may suppose to have been the intention of the parties, but I think I am bound to apply such a rule of construction to the circumstances of the case, and what has been written, as will carry out the law and effectuate that intention so far as the parties have, though imperfectly, expressed themselves. Where words of recital or reference manifest a clear intention that the parties should do certain acts, the Court should infer from them an agreement to do such acts just as if the instrument had contained an express agreement to that effect.\nHaving regard, then, to the whole scope and nature of this transaction, the statute, the advertisement, the tender, the acceptance and the contract, I am of opinion that there is a clear intention shown that what the Government advertised for, what the suppliants tendered for, what the Governor-General in Council, in accepting the tender, intended, and what the contract, prepared by the officers of the Crown, contemplated and agreed the contractors should have, was all the printing that should be required for the several departments of the Government. This, in my opinion, is not a unilateral contract, but a binding mutual agreement solicited by the Crown, responded to by the suppliants, and that response accepted by the Crown, all which, I think, amount in law to mutual binding promises which sustain and uphold each other.\nIn order to ascertain the intention of the parties, we must take notice of the statute and what was done under and by virtue of it in reference to this matter. This contract having been entered into under a statutory authority, stands in a very different position from an ordinary contract between private individuals; in the latter case we have nothing to look to but the contract itself, here we have the statute and what it authorized to be done and what was done by virtue thereof to guide and aid us, and to which, I think, we are bound to refer to ascertain what the law authorized, and from thence, and from the language used by the parties to discover what it was intended to stipulate should be done, bearing always in mind this most important consideration, that this is not Government work which the executive, still less any department, could deal with at its pleasure; that the matter is not under the control of the several departments, nor indeed is it left to the discretion of the executive, but must be dealt with under the statutory provisions, and can be given only after tender, except as provided by sec. 7, which enacts that:\nThe Governor may, from time to time, by Orders in Council authorize for reasons to be stated in such orders, cause printing and binding for the public service to be done without tender; and such Orders in Council and the expenditure under them shall be laid before parliament at its then next session.\nIt is not necessary to discuss whether this section would apply when tenders had been already received and accepted; the suppliants seem to assume it would; at any rate they have only asked to be declared entitled to perform the departmental printing, \"save and excepting such printing as was by Orders in Council and for the reasons stated in such orders, authorized by the Governor in Council to be done without tender,\" and only pray \"that an account may be taken of the quantity and amount of printing done by others than your suppliants and not authorized to be done by an order of the Governor in Council.\"\nIn view then of the law and of the tender, acceptance and contract, I think irresistible implications arise. Can it for a moment be presumed that the Crown could have contemplated that the work tendered and contracted for might be given, as the petition alleges was done in this case, by the departments to others than the contractors, when it could only be so given in violation of law? Is it not an irresistible inference that the contrary was intended? And as to the agreement, must it not be treated as containing the words of both parties, and to those words must there not be given such a reasonable construction as will effectuate the intention of the parties? And while there is a clear obligation on the part of the contractors to do all the departmental printing, is there not implied a corresponding obligation on the part of the Crown to give them the work? I think the agreement itself clearly indicates something to be done on both sides, and that there is on the part of the Crown an obligation to give all the departmental printing, and that this results by legal implication from the terms of the agreement to be gathered from a fair construction of the tender, acceptance, and contract read in the light of the statute by virtue of which alone the work could be done.\nNo doubt there may be contracts by which parties agree to do work when called on, or to carry such goods as may be presented, or to supply stores such as might be ordered from time to time, where there may be no corresponding obligation to furnish work to be done, or goods to be carried, or to order goods to be supplied, and these are the class of cases relied on by the counsel for the Crown in this case, but they are clearly distinguishable from this that we are dealing with.\nThe Government did not ask tenders for such printing as they might think fit to order for five years, but tenders were asked for the performance of certain specific work, viz., for printing the Canada Gazette, the Statutes, Orders in Council, other books or blank books, forms, blanks and other printing required by the several departments of the Government.\nThere might be some analogy to the cases referred to, if it turned out that during the five years the contract had to run the Government had little or no departmental printing; in such an event, if the contractors claimed the Crown was bound to find printing for them to do, it might well be contended that had the contractors desired to protect themselves against such a contingency they should have required a provision to be inserted in reference thereto, and not having done so, they took the risk of such an event happening, and therefore had no right to complain, and the Crown might, in such a case, contend, with some show of reason, and possibly support their contention by the cases referred to, that though they undertook to give the contractors all the departmental printing, they did not undertake to make printing for them, that the only printing they agreed contractors should have was what was required by the departments, and if they required none they could claim none; that is, that in the event of the Government discontinuing all departmental printing, it may be that against such a risk the contractors have not provided and could not complain. But as to the possibility of there being no work to do, of this practically there was no risk at all, because the Laws and Gazette had beyond question to be printed, and the work of the departments absolutely required a certain amount of printing which, in the exigencies of the public service, could not be dispensed with. However, no such question arises here, for the petition shows that there was departmental printing which the contractors agreed to do, but instead of the contractors being permitted to do it, the departments, contrary to the statute, gave the work to others. The observations of Pollock, C.B., in Knight v. Water Works Co.[17], are worthy of notice as very applicable to this case; he says:\nIt is admitted that there is no covenant in express terms contained in the deed, but wherever it is manifest from expressions in a deed that the parties must have intended to stipulate that a particular thing should be done by either of them, there is an implied covenant to do it. * * * But, in fact, every case where a covenant is implied must stand upon its own foundation, and there is great difficulty in arguing from the analogy of other cases; the question always is, what is the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from all the matters to which the courts are entitled to look.\nThe Master of the Rolls, in Thom v. Commissioner of Public Works[18], says:\nThe third question is, what the offer was which was so accepted. This depends on the construction to be put on the original advertisement and the tender of the plaintiffs following it, by the acceptance of which by the defendants through their agents Mr. Price and Mr. Harris, without the imposition of any conditions or limitations whatsoever, the contract is created. The plaintiffs contend that this means the whole of the stone of the kinds mentioned in their offer; the defendants contend that it means only so much stone as they may think fit to let them have.\nThis point, I am also of opinion, must be decided in favour of the plaintiffs. In the first place, the words of the advertisement are general: \"Offers will be received for the old Portland stone, &c.\"; that is offers will be received for all or any part of the Portland stone, &c. It would, no doubt, have been open to any person making a tender to offer to take a portion of what was offered only, specifying what portion he desired to take; and accordingly the plaintiffs offered to take the arch stone, the spandril stone and the Bramley Fall stone only, and made no offer to take the rough rubble. But their offer, which follows the advertisement in the generality of its terms, is to take Westminster bridge stone of the description and at the prices I have already mentioned. I think this means the whole of such stone. If it does not, it is plainly no contract at all for anything; for the vendors could immediately afterwards have said: \"Our contract means that we accept your offer only for as much as we choose to let you have,\" though the plaintiffs might, as the fact is, have been put, to great expense to enable them to perform the contract, in the belief that their offer to take the entirety of the stone had been accepted, the delivery of one ton, or even one cwt. of stone, would have satisfied the contract. And again, on the other hand, unless the plaintiffs had contracted to take the whole, it is plain that the converse objection would apply, and that the vendors might say: \"on the faith of your taking the whole, we have accepted your \"offers and rejected others which would have enabled us to dispose \"of it, and now, when you have taken a ton of each sort, and when \"the price of this sort of stone has fallen, you refuse to take any \"more.\" I think neither of these contentions could be supported. I think it also impossible that any one would hold the contract to be wholly one-sided, and that it meant; \"You, the plaintiffs, must take \"the whole, if we, defendants, choose to require it; but you are not \"entitled to require us to let you have any more than we desire.\" Such a contract, which gives to one party all the advantage of a rise in the price of the articles sold, and none of the disadvantages of a fall in the price of it, obviously could not be supported without express words, and would certainly make most persons very reluctant to enter into any dealings with a Government board. It follows, therefore, that in my opinion, the true construction of the contract is an offer to take the whole of such stone, and an acceptance of that offer which compels the defendants to deliver the whole of that stone. Unless it means this, it means nothing, and the contract is merely idle and illusory. In that case, the advertisement is a mere delusion, and the acceptance by the defendants of the plaintiff's offer amounts to nothing.\n* * * * * *\nBut that meaning must include the whole, as no limit can be placed upon it, nor can any line be drawn that would not be plainly arbitrary between the whole and what amounts practically to nothing.\nI cannot think any business man with the statute before him tendering in response to such an advertisement as was put forward in this case, and having his tender accepted could for a moment suppose that he was not to have the whole work, but that, on the contrary, while he should be at all times ready and bound to do all he should be required to do, at the same time no obligation existed on the part of the Crown to give him anything whatever to do. I cannot think it consistent either with ordinary business notions or with common sense to suppose that any sane man would tender under such an idea, in view of the extent of the work a contractor might be required at any moment to do, the number of men he must always have in readiness, the amount of capital that must be invested, material that must necessarily be kept constantly on hand for the performance of the work, for the contract says the contractor must be prepared to deliver work at short notice, and he will be expected to use the newest styles of types and to keep the work up to the standard of first-class workmanship, and in addition to this he is required to give good and sufficient security in the sums of $5,000 by a bond of a guarantee company approved by the Government for the due fulfilment of his contract, and all to extend over a period of five years; and if the present contention should prevail, with no obligation to secure to them the work, but that the contractors with their men, capital, printing presses, materials, may remain for five years ready for work at a moment's notice, and yet, during all that time, not be in a position to require that a dollar's amount of the work advertised to be done should be given them, but they must keep up such a large establishment of expensive machinery and skilled workmen and be compelled to stand by and see their neighbor employed, without tender, to do the very work for which their tender had been accepted, no such an utterly absurd state of things could possibly, in my opinion, have been present to their minds or intended by any of the parties; the idea of such a contract being sought by the Government or entered into by any sane man is opposed not only to every principle on which business transactions are based, but to reason and common sense. This would of itself be sufficient to negative the contention, but there is to be found in the contract itself abundant evidence that nothing so unnatural and absurd was contemplated. I think the length of time (five years) for which tenders were asked suggests very strongly the inference that as the work was of a nature and magnitude involving the expenditure of so large an amount no contractor would be found to make such an outlay unless not only the certainty of the work but the certainty of the work for a lengthened period was secured to him, and therefore it may be fairly inferred the Government contemplated the contractor would be entitled to all the work for which he tendered. By the sixth paragraph of the contract it is\nProvided always, and it is the true intent and meaning of this contract and of the parties hereto, that if the contractors at any time during the subsistence thereof fail, in the opinion of the Queen's Printer, in the performance of any, or either, of the covenants or agreements herein contained in any respect; and if the Governor in Council should consider that the exigencies of the public service require that the Departmental Printing should be, by reason of such default, taken out of the hands of \"The contractors\" and given to others, the Governor General in Council may, in such case, at any time thereafter, declare this contract rescinded, and the same shall be thenceforth treated as null and void. \"The contractors,\" neverless, being and continuing liable for all damages and expenses consequent upon their default.\nDoes this not establish that this contract was not intended to be unilateral? And is not the contention on the part of the Crown that the suppliants were only entitled to have so much of the Departmental printing as by requisition might be made on them by and on behalf of the several respective departments, and that all or any portion of the printing might be given to other parties by the departments inconsistent with this clause? Have we not here a clear declaration that the intent and meaning of the contract and of the parties thereto was, that it was only on failure, in the opinion of the Queen's Printer, by the contractors to fulfil the agreement on their part, and on the Governor in Council considering that the public service required that the printing should be taken from them and given to others, that such was to happen? What other meaning can be attached to the provision, that in the events spoken of\u2014\nThe departmental printing should be by reason of such default taken out of the hands of the contractors and given to others, that the Governor in Council may in such case at any time thereafter, declare this contract rescinded, and the same shall be thenceforth treated as null and void?\nWhy this power to rescind the contract if no obligation on the Crown to give the printing to the suppliants, or if they had not a right to require it? On the hypothesis now set up the Crown could have ceased to give the suppliants any departmental printing, and that would, so far as the Crown was concerned, have terminated the contract; but this clause saves the contractors from any such termination, and secures to them the protection of the opinion of the Queen's Printer, and the consideration and determination of the Governor-in-Council, that the exigencies of the public service required that they should be deprived of the departmental printing, before it could be taken from them and given to others, or in language of the contract \"taken out of the hands of 'the contractors' and given to others.\" The language of this paragraph is the language of both parties, for it is inserted by way of proviso in an agreement prepared by the Government officials, and declares:\nProvided, and it is the true intent and meaning of this contract and of the parties hereto.\nAnd therefore, giving the language used a reasonable construction, the necessary implication from that language is, that the contractors were to have all the departmental printing, and that there was an obligation on the part of the Crown to give them such printing, and such an obligation being on the Crown this clause was no doubt likewise inserted for the protection of the Crown to enable the Crown, in the events indicated, to free itself from such obligation and be placed in a position to deal with other parties in relation thereto.\nThat this taking of the departmental printing out of the hands of the contractors applies to the whole departmental work contemplated by the contract, viz., all the departmental work required to be done by the respective departments, and not to work which might be in the hands of the contractors under requisition from any one of the departments, is made, to my mind, abundantly clear, for in this paragraph \"the departmental printing\" is spoken of without limit or restriction, and in the recital the meaning of the terms \"the departmental printing\" is placed beyond all doubt, and shows both what tenders were advertised for and what all parties understood by the term \"departmental printing\" and how it was used and to be understood in the contract; for, after reciting at length the 6th section of the 82 & 33 Vic., we have this recital:\nAnd whereas, in pursuance thereof, tenders were advertised for, amongst other things, the printing for the several departments of the Government of Canada (commonly called the departmental printing) for the term of 5 years, to be reckoned and computed from the 1st day of October, 1874, and the Governor in Council has seen fit to accept a certain tender made for the performance of such service and work by the contractors.\nIf anything more could be wanting to place this beyond a peradventure, and to show that it did not apply to work for which requisitions may have been made, we have sec. 3 which makes provision for such work, and provides that such work \"not being delivered and performed in a perfectly workmanlike manner,\" the department which may have required the work, may require the same to be re-executed, &c., and \"the department so requiring the work to be done shall be at liberty, if it shall be thought the exigencies of the public service require it, to require other parties to do such work,\" and makes contractors liable to pay, &c.\nIn dealing with a clause such as the 6th, in the Great Northern Railway v. Harrison[19], in which the question was whether there was a covenant on the part of the company to take a certain quantity of sleepers, Parke, B., delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, after premising that\nNo particular form of words is necessary to form a covenant, but, wherever the Court can collect from the instrument an engagement on the one side to do or not to do something, it amounts to a covenant, whether it is in the recital or in any other part of the instrument\u2014\nproceeds to apply the rule, and after going through the deed says; Then comes a clause which proves to demonstration that the company understood themselves to be contracting to receive the whole quantity of 350,000 sleepers within the times limited. \"That in case the contractors, their executors, &c., shall not regularly deliver the said sleepers in such quantities and at such times and place as are or is herein agreed upon to the satisfaction of the engineers of the company according to this contract, or shall from any cause whatever other than the acts of the said company or their agent be prevented from making such delivery or deliveries as aforesaid according to this present contract, and if such default, impediment, or delay shall continue for the space of 15 days, next after notice in writing, signed by the secretary of the said company, or by their engineer, requiring them to put an end to such default, impediment, or delay, shall have been given to the said contractors, or if they the said contractors before the completion of this contract shall be declared bankrupt or insolvents, then, and in any of such cases, it shall be lawful for the company, and as they shall think proper by writing under the hand of their secretary, absolutely to determine this contract. Is not that just as if the company had in so many words recited that this is their contract? and if it be their contract it is clearly a contract on the one side to deliver, and on the other to receive, the entire number of sleepers mentioned in the recital and in the specification.\nThis construction of the agreement introduces no new term into the contract, but simply carries out the law and gives effect to the intention of the parties as it is to be gathered from the nature of the transaction and as exhibited on the face of the contract itself. To put any other construction would render the statute of no effect and to make the advertising, tender, acceptance and contract, so far as the contractor is concerned, perfectly illusory.\nAnd when we look at the other work for which tenders were asked in the same advertisement and in the same terms, and which was tendered for, and tenders accepted in the same manner, viz.: the printing of the Statutes and the Royal Gazette, can it be supposed that it could ever have been conceived by either party, that after such an advertisement, tender accepted and contract, that any Department of the Government could take from the contractors the printing of the laws and Gazette, and give it to others or divide the work and give portions of it away from the contractors to others, as, for instance, to give the printing of the Gazette one week or month to the contractors and another week or month to other parties, and the contractors be compelled to be ready at all times, week in and week out, with materials and artizans to do the work? The proposition seems to me too absurd; the mere statement of such an idea suggests its own refutation, but if part of the departmental printing may be given by any of the departments to others to do when the contractor is able and ready and willing to do the work in a proper manner, as the petition alleges these contractors at all times were, why may not the printing of the Gazette or of the laws be dealt with in like manner? in other words: the tender and its acceptance was intended to be the agreement between the parties. The tender was accepted \"pure and simple,\" and the tender and acceptance indicated the contracting mind of both parties, and so a contract was constituted between the Crown and the suppliants. The preparation of a contract by the officers of the Government and requiring the signatures of the tenderers thereto, was merely for expressing the agreement arrived at in formal language, and possibly to comply with the direction of the statute, certainly not to lessen the liability of the Crown, still less to release the Crown from the obligation of fulfilling the contract.\nHad this case then rested on the contract alone, I should have been of opinion the obligation existed to give all the required printing to the contractors, but by the statute and contract read together, to my mind, the matter is placed beyond all question, and I should have dealt with it in a much more summary manner were it not that I find two of my learned brothers have come to a different conclusion. In deference to their views, I have considered it right to put forward at greater length than I should otherwise have thought necessary to do, the reasons which have so strongly constrained me to the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nSTRONG, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nI am of opinion that the appeal from that portion of the judgment respecting the departmental contract ought to be dismissed. As to the contract for the printing with the joint committee of the House and the Senate, I cannot find any way to make the executive answerable for it. The law takes such precautions to prevent any interference on the part of the Government in that contract, that I cannot see how they can be made responsible.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed on both parts of the action for the reasons contained in Justice Gwynne's judgment, which I have seen, and in which I fully concur.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, and that judgment should be ordered to be entered in the Exchequer Court in favor of Her Majesty upon the demurrer filed to the suppliants' petition, and for the reasons stated in that demurrer.\nAs to the parliamentary contract, signed by and between the suppliants, of the first part, and Henry Hartney, in his capacity as clerk of the joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada on the printing of Parliament, of the second part, it shows plainly, upon its face, that it is not a contract between Her Majesty and the suppliants, and that Her Majesty is not affected by it, or liable to be proceeded against upon it by petition of right.\nThe joint committee on printing of both Houses of Parliament can in no sense be said to be servants or agents of Her Majesty, or in any respect to represent Her Majesty. They, as members of the respective Houses of Parliament, are appointed by the house to which respectively they belong, to render services, the object of which is to enable the respective houses effectually to perform their parliamentary duties; and for the due rendering of such services by such committee, the members constituting it can be responsible only to the respective houses by whom they are appointed, and if that joint committee, which is the body having authority over all parliamentary printing, and power to enter into all contracts for that purpose, are not themselves servants or agents of Her Majesty, it is plain that their subordinate officer or clerk cannot be such an agent. It is contended that as he receives his appointment under the great seal of the Dominion, contracts, entered into by him under the order and direction of his superiors, the committee, become contracts entered into by him on behalf of Her Majesty, but no case has been cited in support of this proposition, and if his immediate superiors, the committee, are not agents of Her Majesty, I cannot see how their subordinate officer or clerk can be such agent.\nAs to the other contract set out in the petition, which upon its face does purport to be made between the suppliants of the first part and Her Majesty the Queen of the second part, and which is executed by the suppliants, and is on their part a contract whereby, after reciting the fact that tenders had been called for by the Dominion Government, and had, in pursuance of such call, been made by the suppliants, for the printing of certain work for the government, namely, for the printing of the statutes and orders in council, at certain scheduled prices for that work mentioned in a specification, and for printing the Canada Gazette, at certain other scheduled prices specified for that work, and for printing what is called \"departmental matter\" at certain other scheduled prices appropriate to such matter, the suppliants covenanted that:\nIn consideration of the sums and prices for the several different descriptions of work and services embraced in the said tender to be done and performed by the contractors in accordance with and at the respective rates and prices mentioned and expressed in the printed schedule and specification thereof annexed to the contract, and which is to be read and construed as part and parcel thereof as if the same were embodied therein, they, the contractors, should and would, from time to time, and at all times during the term of five years, well, truly, faithfully, and promptly do, perform and execute, or cause, or procure, to be done, performed, and executed all jobs or lots of printing for the several departments of the Government of Canada of reports, pamphlets, circulars, and blank forms of every description and kind soever coming within the denomination of Departmental Printing, and all the work and services connected therewith and appertaining thereto, as set forth in the said specification annexed to the contract, in such numbers and quantities as may be specified in the several requisitions which may be made upon them for that purpose from time to time by and on behalf of the said several respective departments, the contractors being in all cases furnished with the necessary supplies of paper, and they furnishing the necessary inks for the purpose; such jobs or lots of work to be executed and performed in a good and workmanlike manner, in strict accordance with the terms of the said schedule and specification in every respect and to the entire satisfaction of the Queen's Printer, and to be delivered by the said contractors to the said several departments or the Queen's Printer on their behalf, as he or they may direct within a reasonable period after the receipt of the requisitions therefor respectively.\nThe contract contains no express covenant or agreement as made, and in fact is not signed, by any one as representing or on behalf of Her Majesty. Now, from the above contract, as signed by the suppliants, although it may be that a contract upon the part of the Crown should be implied to the effect that the Dominion Government would give to the suppliants the printing of the matter particularly specified under the separate heads of the statutes, and orders in council and the Canada Gazette, yet as to the other jobs or lots of work, coming under the denomination of departmental printing the suppliants' contract, as it appears to me, is that they will execute in a good and workmanlike manner, at certain scheduled prices, all jobs or lots of such matter as the suppliants, by requisition, from the several departments, shall be required to execute, the departments supplying the paper, and that they will complete such work within a reasonable period after the receipt of such requisitions respectively; and from such a contract there cannot, in my judgment, be implied any agreement upon the part of the Crown, that all the departmental work which the departments may have occasion to have printed, shall be given to suppliants to print, which is the contention asserted by the suppliants in this petition.\nIn Dwarris v. Harris[20] and Thorn v. Mayor of London[21] it is laid down as a rule, that in determining a question of this kind, no covenant is to be implied, unless it is clear to all men of ordinary intelligence and knowledge of business, that what is sought to be implied must have been either latently in, or palpably present to the mind of both parties to, the contract when it was made; unless that be clearly so, the introduction of the covenant desired to be implied is, in truth, the introduction into the contract of a wholly new term, which no court is competent to do. In Churchward v. The Queen[22] Cockburn, C.J., states the rule that the court is not lightly to assume what is not expressed, still less is it to imply that which it is convinced from what is expressed that the parties never intended. Mr. Justice Mellor[23] says:\nWe have to ascertain from the nature of the instrument, the parties to it, the subject-matter of the contract, and the expressions actually used in it, what was the meaning and intention of the parties; and in order to ascertain that we must not only consider the actual language and expressions contained in the instrument, but all that must necessarily be implied from the scheme of the instrument and the expressions used in it, and if we can see that certain stipulations and conditions must have been necessarily intended by the parties, although not fully expressed in words, we must give effect to such intent.\nAnd Mr. Justice Lush[24] says:\nIn order to raise what is called an implied covenant, I apprehend the intention must be manifest to the judicial mind, and there must also be some language, some words or other, capable of expressing that intention.\nIn order to imply the covenant which is sought to be implied in the present case; namely, that besides the specific articles mentioned in the specifications, namely, the statutes, Gazette, &c., &c., all the departmental printing which might be required for the use of the various departments of the Government during the period of five years, should be given to the suppliants to execute, it is essential that the judicial mind should be convinced beyond all doubt from what is expressed in the instrument that such was the clear intent of the parties acting on behalf of Her Majesty. Now, so far from finding any words in the instrument indicative of such an intention, it appears to me to be impossible that the persons acting for Her Majesty would have consented, if they had been asked, to the introduction into the instrument of any words which could be construed to have the effect of the covenant which is sought to be implied. The introduction into the instrument of such a covenant, if proposed to have been inserted in express terms, might very naturally, as it appears to me, have been objected to as interfering with, and neutralising, during the five years named in the instrument, the power vested in the Governor General by the 7th sec. of the Act 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 7, (upon which Act the suppliants rest their claim to have the covenant implied,) by which the Governor General is authorized by orders in council from time to time, for reasons stated in such orders, to cause printing, &c., for the public service to be executed without tender, notwithstanding the general provisions of the Act requiring all printing, &c., to be done under contracts after the receipt of tenders therefor. If the contention of the suppliants be correct that there should be implied a covenant, binding on Her Majesty, that the suppliants should have given to them all the departmental printing, which might be required for the public service during the period named, then of necessity the power of the Governor General under this section of the Act is interfered with, if not wholly excluded during the existence of the contract. To my mind there is nothing expressed in the instrument which would justify us in holding such to have been the intention of the parties acting on behalf of Her Majesty in entering into the contract which was entered into with the suppliants, and which is the subject of the present proceeding, and we cannot, I think, hold such to have been their clear intent without falling into the error of making a new contract for them.\nAppeal allowed as to demurrer on Parliamentary Printing contract, and dismissed as to demurrer on Departmental Printing contract, without costs to either appellant or respondent in either court.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitors for respondent: Maclennan & McDonald.\n[1] Albany Law Journal; 9th March, 1881.\n[2] 3 H. & c. 667.\n[3] 6 B. & C. 718.\n[4] 5 Q.

The Court of Appeal reversed this decree, on the ground that C.S.U.C. ch. 48, sec. 15, re-enacted by R.S.O. ch. 115, sec 1, made all streams, whether naturally or artificially floatable, public waterways.\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring the decree of the Court of Chancery,) that the learned Vice-Chancellor who tried the case, having determined that upon the evidence adduced before him, the stream at the locus in quo, when in a state of nature, was not floatable without the aid of artifical improvements, and such finding being supported by the evidence in the case, the appellant had at common law the exclusive right to use his property as he pleased, and to prevent respondents from using as a highway the stream in question where it flowed through appellant\u2019s private property.\nHeld,\u2014Also (approving of Boale v. Dickson)[1], that the C.S.U.C. ch. 48, sec. 15, re\u2011enacted by R.S.O. ch. 115, sec. 1, which enacts that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber, rafts, and crafts down all streams in Upper Canada, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, etc., extends only to such streams as would, in their natural state, without improvements, during freshets, permit saw logs, timber, etc., to be floated down them, and that the portions of the stream in question, where it passes through the appellant\u2019s land, were not within the said statute[2].\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario, whereby a decree of the Court of Chancery in favor of the plaintiff, the respondent herein, was reversed[3].\nThe facts, pleadings and points relied on, cases cited, and statutes referred to by counsel, appear sufficiently in the report of the case in the court below[4], and in the judgments hereinafter given. Mr. Hector Cameron, Q.C. Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., and Mr. Creelman, for appellant, and Mr. James Bethune, Q.C., and L.R. Church, Q.C., for respondents.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe bill in this case was filed in the Court of Chancery on the 4th May, 1880, on behalf of the appellant, Peter McLaren, against the respondents, B. Caldwell & Son, to restrain them passing or floating timber and saw logs through portions of the main branch of the Mississippi river and its northern tributaries, Louse creek and Buckshot creek, where these streams passed and flowed through the lands of the appellant and over the dams, slides, and improvements owned or constructed by the appellant along these streams.\nVice-Chancellor Proudfoot, on the 4th of May, granted an ex parte injunction to the plaintiff (appellant), and on the 21st day of May, 1880, continued the injunction until the hearing of the cause.\nFrom this decision the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, and on the 2nd of June, 1880, by a judgment of that court, the injunction granted was dissolved. The defendants thereupon answered the plaintiff\u2019s bill in the usual course on the 11th of August, 1880. Replication was filed on the 3rd of September, 1880.\nThe cause came on for examination of witnesses and hearing before Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, at Brockville, on the 27th of October, 1880, and afterwards at Perth, on the 8th of December, 1880, and was continued until the 16th of December, on which day the Vice-Chancellor pronounced a decree in favour of the appellant.\nFrom this decree the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and their appeal was allowed.\nFrom this decision the plaintiff now appeals to this court. At the time the bill was filed the respondents were proceeding to drive their logs, in all some 18,000 logs, through all the appellants improvements on Louse creek and Buckshot creek, and on the Mississippi, all of which flow through the lots of land of which the appellant was, and still is, the owner in fee simple.\nThe plaintiff contends that the stream in question where it passes through his property is non-navigable, and non-floatable at all seasons of the year,\u2014that he has, by artificial means placed on his own property, enabled lumber to float over his property through the course of said stream, and the main question at issue between the parties is this:\u2014Has the appellant the legal right to prevent (as he seeks by his bill to do) the respondents driving their logs through his lands, and in doing so to utilize the improvements owned by him, on and along the streams in question? or, are those streams part of the public highway, and, therefore, open to the free use of the respondents in common with the appellant and the public generally?\nIt cannot be disputed, I think, that if those portions of the streams in which plaintiff\u2019s improvements were made, are incapable of being navigated or floated at any time of the year, and the fee simple of the beds of such streams is in plaintiff, the public at common law have no right whatever to enter on such private property, and plaintiff, having the absolute title to the same, has the sole right to deal with the bed and soil of the stream, and to place such improvements, constructions and erections thereon as he may choose. While it seems to be admitted that the public have no right to enter on such property and make improvements thereon, it is claimed that in Ontario, when streams of the character mentioned are rendered capable of being navigated through the instrumentality of such improvements made by the owner of the soil, whereby lumber can at freshet times be floated through private property, the public have an absolute common law right to use such improvements and to deal with the stream, as if the same had been naturally floatable, that is, without the aid of artificial improvements; and this right it is also claimed, is conferred on the public by virtue of the statutory enactments of the Province of Ontario.\nThe Act 12 Vic., cap. 87, is intituled, \u201cAn Act to amend an Act passed in the Parliament of Upper Canada in the ninth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Fourth, intituled \u2018An Act to provide for the construction of aprons to mill dams over certain streams in this Province, and to make further provision in respect thereof.\u2019\u201d\nSection 5 of this Act is in the following words:\nAnd be it enacted that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer and autumn freshets and that no person shall, by felling trees, or placing any other obstruction in, or across such stream, prevent the passage thereof; provided always that no person using such stream, in manner and for the purposes aforesaid, shall alter, injure or destroy any dam or other useful erection in, or upon the bed, of or across any such stream, or do any unnecessary damage thereto or on the banks of such stream; provided there shall be a convenient apron, slides, gate, lock or opening in any such dam or other structure made for the passage of all saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts authorized to be floated down such streams as aforesaid.\nThe Act 12 Vic. c. 87, remained in force until 1859, when it was repealed by Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, at page 462.\nIt was, however, substantially re-enacted during the same year as chapter 48 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, of which Act the above section 5 is made to comprise sections 15 and 16. This Act is intituled \u2018An Act respecting mills and mill dams.\u201d Section 15 of chapter 48 is as follows:\u2014\nAll persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.\nThere can be no doubt that statutes which encroach on the rights of the subject, whether as regards persons or property, should receive a strict construction, and if a reasonable doubt remains, which cannot be satisfactorily solved, the subject is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, in other words he shall not be injured or affected in his person or property, unless the intention of the Legislature to interfere with the one or take away the other is clearly and unequivocally indicated.\nAt the very outset, if defendants contention can be maintained, we are met with the singular incongruity of the Legislature enacting that \u201cit shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down,\u201d or \u201cthat all persons may float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down\u201d streams that from the nature of the streams themselves it is impossible saw logs, &c., could be floated down; in other words it seems most unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended to legislate that it should be lawful to do what in the nature of things could not be done. Is it not much more reasonable to assume that the Legislature was dealing with a subject-matter capable of being used in the manner in which it is declared it shall be lawful to use it, and that in this view the language of the Legislature had reference to all streams on or through which saw logs and other timber, &c., could either during the spring, summer or autumn freshets be floated?\nThe object of the Legislature was, in my opinion, in the interest of the timber business, not to interfere with or take away any private right, but to settle by statutory declaration any doubt that might exist as to streams incapable of being navigated by boats, but capable of floating property, such as saw logs and timber, only at certain seasons of the year, viz.: during spring, summer, or autumn freshets; thereby classing such streams as public highways, by adopting a test of navigability judicially recognized and acted on in the Province of New Brunswick, as far back as 1842, and in some, though not in all, of the American States, as applicable to the circumstances and necessities of this country, and which circumstances do not exist in England, where no such test prevails, thus affirming and settling a new and debatable point, viz.: the right of the public to float timber, &c, down streams floatable only in freshet times, and the Legislature having thus established the right proceeded to prevent the obstruction of the same; but, nevertheless, subject always to the restrictions imposed in respect to erections for milling purposes on such streams, and the action of the Legislature was not intended to interfere with private property and private rights in streams not by nature floatable at any season of the year.\nIf the Legislature contemplated what is now contended for, and intended the enactment to apply to streams not-floatable at all seasons, as there is no pretence for saying that the Legislature has conferred any right on the public to enter on private property on any such non-floatable streams, and make it floatable, and as a non-floatable stream cannot be made practically floatable by operation of law, what was the specific legal right conferred on the public by the statute? Is it not obvious that the only effect of the enactment could be to confer on the public the right to use private property and the improvements made thereon by the proprietors thereof without making any compensation therefor? From this section is it possible to infer any such intention? Had any such intention been present to the mind of the Legislature it should have been, and I think it would have been, clearly and unequivocally expressed. To attribute to the Legislature an intention so unreasonable and unjust is not justifiable unless the language is so direct and unambiguous as to admit of no doubt or other construction.\nI am at a loss to appreciate the force of the illustration given by Mr. Justice Patterson of the statutory highways of Ontario, as being at all analogous to the case of non-floatable streams. It seems entirely to beg the question No doubt, if the Legislature had, in so many words, declared all streams, whether or not navigable or floatable, common or public highways, then doubtless the improvements or the removal of obstructions on such common or public highways, could in no way interfere with their common and public character. But this leaves us just where we were, and in no way that I can see solves the question wo have to determine, viz.: whether or not the Legislature has so declared streams not floatable, public highways. It may so happen, and no doubt has happened, that in grants of land, allowances for roads therein dedicated as highways, on actual survey, and on the laying out of the roads, have proved, from the natural character of the ground, impassable as highways. But it is clear that any such case must be exceptional and accidental.\nIt cannot, I think, be supposed that the Legislature would, knowingly, dedicate by law, over private property, common and public highways, which could never be used as such by reason of the land being by nature totally unfit for and impassable as a highway. On the same principal, it seems to me as equally unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended simply to declare it lawful for all persons to float saw logs down streams in freshet times, through which, at such times, no logs could by any possibility be floated. I am likewise quite at a loss to understand how such a mere declaration, impossible to be acted on, could encourage the lumber trade or afford any facilities to parties engaged in the lumber trade in conveying their rafts to market.\nThen as to the right to use the improvements of a proprietor by which he has made the stream floatable. The proprietor of a non-floatable stream who makes it floatable for his own use, does no more than if he made a canal through his property. He does not interfere with his neighbor; he takes nothing from the public, who can neither use the stream as it is, nor improve it, except by the permission of the proprietor, and as to whom, having no right or property therein, the improvement of the proprietor does no wrong, and who are placed in no worse position by the owner\u2019s refusal to permit them to be used than they were in if no such improvement had been made.\nIt has been urged that to allow an individual to shut up a stream a hundred miles long because he may own small portions of the stream not floatable in a state of nature would be most unreasonable. But it seems to be forgotten that it is not the individual who shuts up the stream, it is closed by natural impediments which prevent such portions being used for floatable purposes, and as it is admitted the public have no right to enter on such portions and erect improvements whereby the stream in those parts may be made navigable or floatable by reason of the same being private property, the stream is as effectually shut up by a refusal to permit an entry and improvements to be made as if the proprietor himself made the improvements and prohibited the use thereof by the public. If the use of the non-floatable portions of a stream is as necessary for the carrying on of lumbering operations as has been urged, the obvious means of securing a right to use private improvements would be to obtain by payment of an adequate consideration the proprietor\u2019s permission, or, if the streams are unimproved, to secure from the proprietor the privilege of making such necessary improvements, or, failing the ability to accomplish this, if the development of the public domain, the exigencies of the public, or the business of the country, is of such paramount importance in comparison with individual loss or inconvenience as to require that private rights should give way to the public necessity, the remedy must be sought at the hands of the legislature through the instrumentality of expropriation, with suitable and full compensation under and by virtue of the right of eminent domain. There is, in my opinion, nothing whatever to justify the conclusion that the legislature intended under this provision to exercise its right of eminent domain, and expropriate the property of the owners of streams not by nature navigable or floatable, or any property or improvements the owner might place or make thereon.\nBut, in my opinion, as I have suggested, the Legislature merely intended that all streams through which lumber could pass, whether all the year round, or only during the freshet times, should, for the purposes of the lumber trade, be common and public highways, but did not intend thereby to enact that streams through which lumber could not pass, even in times of freshets, should be common and public highways, still less that sluiceways and improvements on private property, through which, in its natural state, lumber could not be passed, should become subject to public uses any more than a canal or railroad dug or constructed on private property round a natural obstruction.\nThe case of Harod v. Worship[5], is somewhat analogous. At any rate principles are therein enunciated very applicable to the present:\nThe Great Yarmouth Haven Act, 1835, sec. 76, subject to a penalty any person who shall place on any space of ground immediately adjoining to the Haven and within ten feet from high water mark, any goods, materials or articles, so as to obstruct the free and commodious passage through or over the same, or who shall break down or remove any quay head or river bank next adjoining such Haven for the purpose of forming a dock, without making and maintaining a foot bridge over the same. By the Great Yarmouth Haven Improvement Act, 1849, sec. 18, the commissioners of the Act shall twice in the year inspect the public right or rights of way, in and along both shores of the Haven, and shall take all necessary proceedings to abate or remove every encroachment made on such right or rights of way. Upon appeal against a conviction under the former enactment, a case for the opinion of this court stated that the appellant who occupied a boat building yard, which sloped down to the Haven, placed three boats on the part of the yard immediately adjoining the Haven, and within the space of ten feet from high water mark, so as to obstruct the free and commodious passage over the same. There was no public right of passage there. Held, by Cockburn, C.J., and Crompton and Blackburn, JJ., that a right of way was not given by sec. 76 of the Great Yarmouth Haven Act, 1835, and that the section only applied where a right of way existed, and therefore that the appellant was not properly convicted. Wightman, J., dissentiente, on the ground that the section was intended to secure a passage free from obstruction along the side of the Haven.\nCockburn, C.J.:\u2014\nI adhere to the opinion which we intimated when the case was before us in last Michaelmas Term, namely that s. 76 of Stat. 5-6 W. IV. c. xlix does not create any right of passage where none existed at the time of the passing of the Act. The offence of which the appellant has been convicted is that of placing materials within ten feet of the haven of Great Yarmouth, so as to obstruct the free and commodious passage through and over the same. In fact there was not at the time of the passing of the Act, any right of passage for the public over it: therefore, unless the Act created the right, the appellant could not be convicted of an obstruction of it within s. 76.\nIt is argued that the effect of s. 76 is to give a right of passage over the space in question for using the haven; and that s. 18, of Stat. 12-13 Vic. c. xlviii, by which the Commissioners of the Act are authorized and required to inspect the public rights of way, in and along the shores of the Haven, and are required to take proceedings to abate or remove encroachments on such rights, confirms that construction. But it is a canon of construction of acts of parliament, that the rights of individuals are not interfered with unless there is an express enactment to that effect, and compensation is given to them, and it would militate against the canon and seriously interfere with private rights, if we held that the enactment in s. 76, carried into it, by implication, a right by the public to pass over the space in question. I think the legislature meant that both s. 76 of Stat. 5-6 W. IV. c. xlix and s. 18 of Stat. 12-13 Vic. c. xlviii should be applied to those places where a public right of way already existed, and not where previously there was no right of way. The effect of not so limiting the application of those enactments would be, that whereas there are many private grounds along the shore of the Haven, a right could be given by implication to the public to interfere with and remove private walls and pass over private property; which could not be intended, without compensation. Therefore I am of opinion that s. 76 of Stat. 5-6 W. IV, ch. xlix, must be limited to the cases in which a right of passage has been enjoyed by the public.\nWightman, J.:\u2014\nThe section says nothing about obstructing a right of way; but it prohibits, under the penalty of \u00a35 any person placing any goods, materials, or articles whatsoever upon the ground immediately adjoining the Haven, \u201cso as to obstruct the free and commodious passage \u201cthrough or over the same.\u201d Whoever may have a right to go over the adjoining land, and for whatever purpose and however that right may arise, is to have a free passage by the terms of the section, which provides that a clear space of ten feet is to be left. The words are very strong, and it is, I think, very difficult to get over them. I admit that there may be a difficulty as to their conferring upon the public a right of way over the land, and I do not know to what extent such a right may be given, or whether it is given at all; nor do I know that there was any reason for the enactment, except that for the general purposes of the Haven, it was considered expedient to keep a space clear at the side of it, but the obstruction is prohibited in express terms.\nCrompton, J.:\u2014\nThe other construction is an interference with private rights without any compensation to individual owners; and we ought to see clearly that such was the intention of the legislature before we adopt that construction. I cannot see that the statute gives a public right of passage often feet width all around the Haven. Blackburn, J.:\u2014\nIt is important that there should be rights of passage along the sides of this ancient Haven, and it is very likely that there should be, though not on every part. Taking s. 76 by itself, the first part of it must be construed by the respondent, either as declaring that there is, and shall be a free and commodious passage all round the Haven, that is, giving the right and imposing a penalty for obstructing it, according to which construction the section takes away a private right without giving compensation, or, if it does not give a free and commodious passage, it must be construed, as enacting that the space is to be kept open though no person could use it, and though there was no right of way at the time of the passing of the Act. So also as to the second part of the section, which subjects to a penalty any person who forms a dock on the side of the Haven without making and maintaining a footway bridge over it, we cannot suppose that the legislature would order a safe foot bridge to be made and maintained unless foot passengers had a right to go there: and if they had it not, the respondents must contend that the legislature gave it. But I agree with the Lord Chief Justice and my brother Crompton that we should not construe that section so as to interfere with private rights. The words of that section, if literally read, bear the construction put upon them by my brother Wightman, but that would subject a person to a penalty for doing an act upon his own land. I think we must construe the section as imposing a penalty for doing an act of obstruction at those places where a public right exists.\nI am very much strengthened in the conclusion at which I have arrived by the weight of judicial authority in Ontario.\nThe question appears to have been raised and determined as far back as 1863 in the case of Boale v. Dickson[6], and by that case the slides in question appear to have been put up and used as private property on a non-floatable stream for twenty years. This case affirmed the proposition that the legislation in question \u201cextends only to such streams as in their natural state will without improvements during freshets permit saw logs, timber, &c., to be floated down them.\u201d The judgment in this case was prepared by Draper, C.J. and adopted as the judgment of the court by Chief Justice Richards and A Wilson and J. Wilson JJ. This case was acted on in 1865, by the unanimous judgment of the Common Pleas, in Whelan v. McLachlan[7], and was again affirmed in McLaren v. Bucke[8], by Hagarty, C.J., Gwynne and Galt, JJ.\nIn the present case we have V.C. Proudfoot, while considering himself bound by the decision in Boale v. Dickson, acting on it, but expressing no doubt as to its soundness, and the decision of Spragge, C.J. and Patterson and Morrison, JJ., overruling these decisions, and Burton, J., again affirming them, so that I find there are in fact three Chief Justices and five Justices in support of the conclusion I have arrived at. One Chief Justice and two justices taking a different view.\nThen again, I think the conclusion I have come to is much strengthened by the circumstance that by the Revised Statutes of Ontario, the Legislature in 1877, after all these decisions, re\u2011enacted chapter 48, of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, passed in 1849, in almost precisely similar words. Considering then, that up to this period all the judicial decisions of all the Judges, with no dissenting voice, from 1863 to 1876, place on this enactment the construction now contended for by the plaintiff, if such construction was so clearly contrary to the intention of the Legislature, so opposed to the development of the Crown domain, so antagonistic to the interest of the public, and so destructive to the lumber business of the country, as has been so strenously urged before us, can it be supposed that the legislature in revising the statutes in 1877, after a series of decisions and only one year after the latest decision, would not have corrected the judiciary, either by a declaratory act, or by new legislation, and have enacted in unmistakable language that private rights on non- floatable streams should be subject to private user, and more particularly so, if such user was to be without compensation. Not having done so, does not this case come with great force within the canon of construction that where a clause in an Act of Parliament, which has received a judicial interpretation, in a court of competent jurisdiction, is re-enacted in the same terms, the legislature is to be deemed to have adopted that interpretation? In this case, I think there is unusual force in treating the re-enactment of this section as a legislative approval of the judicial interpretation it has received; and for holding that such interpretation should not be shaken, when it is considered that the legislature, from such judicial proceedings, must have known that property was being purchased and held and investments made, based on the claim that by such judicial decisions private rights to property had been established and secured. As was said by Lord Ellenborough in Doe d. Ottley v. Manning[9], a long time ago:\nIt is no new thing for the court to hold itself concluded in matters respecting real property by former decisions upon questions in respect of which, if it were res integra they would probably have come to very different conclusions, and if the adhering to such determinations is likely to be attended with inconvenience, it is a matter fit to be remedied by the legislature which is able to prevent the mischief in future, and to obviate all inconvenient consequences which are likely to result from it as to purchases already made.\nAt the trial defendant claimed the right to show, with a view to the correct construction of the statute, that all the streams in Upper Canada, now Ontario, at the time of the passing of these various acts, were non-floatable without artificial improvements and aids of some kind.\nThis evidence was rejected, and he now claims that if the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, there should be a new trial with a view to the recep- tion of evidence of this character, and also on the ground that the Attorney General should be a party to the suit.\nWith respect to the objection that the learned Vice-Chancellor was not justified in the conclusion he arrived at on the question whether the streams in question were, when in their natural state, navigable or floatable for saw logs, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, the appellant contends that it should be answered in the negative, and the respondent contends that it should have been answered in the affirmative.\nThe learned Vice-Chancellor, after hearing the evidence of forty-six witnesses called by the appellant and fifty-six called by the respondents, came to the conclusion, which is stated at page 97 of the case, in the following words:\nAfter carefully weighing all the evidence that has been given here and at Brockville, it seems impossible to escape the conviction, at least I cannot, that without these artificial means (referring to the appellant\u2019s improvements) neither the Mississippi nor Louse, nor Buckshot creek, can be considered floatable, even in freshets or high water.\nNeither of the judges of the Court of Appeal appear to have questioned the finding of the learned judge on this point, and I can find nothing to justify me in saying that the learned Vice-Chancellor arrived at a wrong conclusion, still less to justify me, sitting in this last Court of Appeal, in saying that he was so manifestly wrong that his verdict should be set aside and a new trial had.\nIt is rather inconsistent in defendant claiming a new trial on the ground that he was not permitted to show that all the streams in Ontario were not floatable, when he in the same breath avers and asks us to say the Judge was wrong, under the evidence, that the stream in question was naturally non-floatable, when he alleges the evidence showed it floatable, and as such a public highway, and to grant a new trial on these contradictory grounds.\nIs it not obvious that, to make the construction of the statute dependent on the weight of evidence as to the floatable or non-floatable character during freshet times of all the rivers in Ontario, would necessarily involve the investigation and determination of the character of each and every stream in the province, and which, if judged by the evidence offered in respect to that in question in this case, and which involved the examination of 102 witnesses whose testimony covers some 819 folio pages with some twenty or thirty maps or plans, clearly show that the trial of such a side issue would be interminable and impracticable; but I know of no principle of law by which a party seeking to protect his rights of property can be called on or could be expected to be prepared with evidence to try out such interminable side issues with the sole view of influencing the judgment of the court in the construction of the language of an Act of Parliament.\nAs to the Attorney-General being made a party, if this is private property and not a public highway, the Attorney-General has no more to do with the question than any other member of the community, and there is no more reason why he should be made a party than in any other controversy between private individuals in relation to the rights of private property; to make the Attorney-General a party would be to admit just what plaintiff denies.\nNo judgment in this case can prevent the Attorney-General from protecting the public rights and interests in public highways, wherever he can show they have been infringed.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, and the decree of V.C. Proudfoot be restored with costs in this court and in the court below.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe finding of the learned judge before whom this case was tried, that those parts of the river Mississippi and of Louse and Buckshot creeks, at which the appellant has constructed his improvements, were not originally and in their natural state capable of being used, even in times of freshets, for the transportation of sawlogs or timber, was not on the argument of this appeal demonstrated to be erroneous, and a careful perusal of the evidence has led me to the conclusion that an attempt to impugn that finding would have been hopeless, even if we could have entirely disregarded the rule so often laid down in this court, that the finding of the judge before whom the witnesses were examined is, in the case of contradictory evidence, entitled to the strongest possible presumption in its favor. We must, therefore, assume the facts to be as they are stated in the first declaration with which the decree under appeal is prefaced, namely:\u2014\nThat those portions of the three streams referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint, where they pass through the lands of the plaintiff, when in a state of nature were not navigable or floatable for saw-logs and other timber rafts and crafts down the same.\nThe appellant\u2019s title to the lands upon which he has made the improvements in question, including the beds of the respective streams, was not seriously disputed and has been established by the production of his title deeds. The question for this court to determine is, therefore, purely one of law; namely, whether, either at common law, or under the provisions of the revised statutes of Ontario, chapter 115, sections 1 and 2, the respondent has the right of passage which he claims for his saw-logs and timber through the artifi- cial waterways constructed by the appellant upon the streams in question. It will be convenient in the first place to consider if the respondent has at common law and irrespective of the statute any such right as he thus claims.\nThere can be no doubt that the law in respect of the right of the public to use as highways all streams of sufficient capacity to afford the means of transportation for boats, rafts, logs or timber, was correctly stated by Macaulay, C.J., in his very learned judgment in Reg. v. Meyers[10]. In that case, after examining with great care many English and American and some New Brunswick authorities, and after having given full consideration to a doctrine which seemed to be countenanced by some of the English decisions, that in a fresh water river, above the ebb and flow of the tide, which is technically called a non-navigable river, a public right of navigation can only exist by prescription arising from long continued usage, the learned Chief Justice thus states his conclusion:\nTo make it depend upon usage implies that however navigable in fact, a public easement does not arise prim\u00e2 facie, but is to be acquired by enjoyment, and, if so, the question must become one of time and user combined in a sufficient degree to create and confirm the right. But this is not what I understand to be laid down in Hale de jure Maris, and approved in subsequent authorities, wherefore I prefer the conclusion that in the application of the common law to Upper Canada in substitution for the old law of Canada it should depend upon the fact of natural capacity and not the fact of usage.\nThis case of The Queen v. Meyers, decided nearly thirty years ago (in February, 1853), has never since been judicially controverted or questioned, and might, therefore, considering the high authority of the court which decided it and the length of time it has stood unchallenged, be well considered as by itself a rule of the common law applicable to Upper Canada upon this question, even if its doctrine had not, as I shall presently show that it has, the support of numerous reported cases decided in the American Courts and the approbation of text writers of the highest authority. Mr. Angell in his treatise on Highways[11] states the result of the American decisions, as follows:\nIn the United States it is held that the right of public servitude in a stream depends not upon its navigability, in the common law sense of the term, but upon its capacity for the purposes of trade, business and commerce. Any stream capable of being used in the transportation of any kind of property to market, whether in boats, rafts or single pieces, is a public stream and subject to the public use. The ebb and flow is not the only test, nor is the public easement always founded upon usage or custom; the test is, whether there is in the stream capacity for use for the purpose of transportation valuable to the public; and in this view it is not necessary that the stream should have capacity for floatage at all seasons of the year, nor that it should be available for use against the current as well as with it; if in its natural state and with its ordinary volume of water, either constantly or at regular recurring seasons it has such capacity that it is valuable to the public, it is sufficient.\nFor these propositions the learned author cites numerous cases, decided principally in the courts of Maine, Michigan and New York, which fully sustain his text. Morgan v. King[12]; Moore v. Sanborne[13]; Brown v. Chadbourne[14]; McManus v. Carmichael[15]; Treat v. Lord[16]; Lorman v. Benson[17]; Rhodes v. Otis[18]; Stuart v. Clark[19]; Dalrymple v. Mead[20]. To these authorities may be added that of Chancellor Kent, who states in his commentaries that when a river is navigable for boats or rafts the public have an easement therein, or a right of passage as over a public highway, and this, although the bed of the river is the private property of the riparian holders. It has scarcely been disputed in the present case that this is the correct view of the law, as it was held to have been in Reg. v. Meyers and I refer to the authorities already mentioned rather as bearing upon the construction of the statute upon which the judgment of the court below was altogether founded, than as directly decisive of the present appeal. The right to the use by the public of all possible means of navigation in the transportation of produce and supplies is indeed so essential to the settlement of a new country that such streams may well be likened to ways of necessity, and the doctrine of the common law in recognizing them as highways rested on an analogy to the public right of passing over the private property of adjoining owners to avoid the dangerous or impassable portion of a public road.\nIn a case like the present, however, where the owner of the bed and the banks of a private stream, which, in the part of its course, is insufficient to afford a passage even for the floating of logs or timber in single pieces, has, by artificial means, made it navigable, such improved portion does not for that reason, and because it immediately adjoins parts of the stream which, being naturally susceptible of navigation, the public are entitled to use without compensation, become liable to a servitude for the benefit of the public as in the case of a stream naturally adapted to such a use. This is at once apparent if we consider for a moment the principle upon which the common law has made streams, originally navigable in their natural state, liable to this quasi-easement, which, as I understand it, is that this burden is imposed for the public benefit, whilst the property is vested in the Crown and passes to all subsequent private owners subject to it, whilst in the case of a stream made navigable by artificial construction, the imposition of such a public right of user would be to appropriate private property to public uses without compensation; an encroachment on proprietary rights, which the law not only never sanctions, but seeks in every way to avoid, in the case of positive written laws, by adopting strict and exceptional rules of construction. In Wadsworth v. Smith[21] the Supreme Court of Maine propounds the law on the point now under discussion as follows:\nIf, therefore, Ten Mile Brook was naturally of sufficient size to float boats or mill logs, the public have a right to its free use for that purpose unincumbered with dams, sluices or tolls; and no man can thus lawfully incumber it without the public permission. But such little streams or rivers as are not floatable, that is, cannot, in their natural state, be used for the carriage of boats, rafts, or other property are wholly and absolutely private; not subject to the servitude of the public interest, nor to be regarded as public highways, by water, because they are not susceptible of use as a common passage for the public. If the Ten Mile Brook be naturally a stream of this description, then, although Wadsworth and his grantor have at their own expense made it floatable by artificial means, it did not thereby become public. Smith had no common law right to improve it. It was private property\u2014and when private interests are involved, they shall not be infringed without a satisfaction being made to the parties injured\u2014and it does infringe private interests to suffer the public, without compensation, to pass over private property not being a common highway, inasmuch as it affects the inheritance of the owner.\nSee also Dwinel v. Barnard[22].\nHaving ascertained the state of the common law at the time of the passing of the statute, upon the proper construction of which the decision of this appeal must depend, I next proceed to consider the effect of the enactment in question. It is comprised in the two first sections of the R.S.O. ch. 115, which are as follows:\u2014\nSec. 1. So far as the legislature of Ontario has authority to enact, all persons may, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, float saw logs and other timber, rafts and crafts down all streams; and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof. Sec. 2. In case there is a convenient apron, slide, gate, lock, or opening in any such dam or other structure, made for the passage of saw logs and other timber, rafts, and crafts authorized to be floated down such stream as aforesaid, no person using any such stream in manner and for the purposes aforesaid shall alter, injure, or destroy any such dam or other useful erection in or upon the bed of or across the stream, or do any unnecessary damage thereto or on the banks thereof.\nFor reasons which I will state very concisely, I am of opinion that the words \u201call streams\u201d in the first section did not, as the court below have decided they did, embrace artificially constructed private streams, such as the three streams in question in this case are at the points at which the applicant has by the expenditure of his own money made them navigable.\nFirst, then, to give the words \u201call streams\u201d the construction and application contended for would be to determine this appeal in direct violation of the sound and well recognized canon of construction which has prevailed for centuries, and been constantly approved and acted on by courts administering English law. The rule of construction in question is well stated by Lord Blackburn in the late case of Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[23], in the House of Lords, as follows:\nIt is clear that the burthen lies on those who seek to establish that the legislature intended to take away the private rights of individuals, to show that by express words or necessary implication such an intention appears.\nThen, in order to comply with the rule or canon just referred to, it is incumbent on us to avoid the forbidden construction if it is possible to do so. Do we, then, find in the statute anything which compels us to read the words \u201call streams\u201d as comprising streams in whole or in part artificially constructed?\nThis cannot be pretended, since nothing short of the express mention of such artificial streams would be a sufficient compliance with the first alternative of the rule. And, equally, it cannot be said that there is a necessity for such a construction arising from implication, since nothing short of the fact that there existed no streams other than those artificially constructed to which the Act could apply would warrant such a violent presumption as the rules requires. It is clear, therefore, to my mind, that no other streams were intended than those which the law had already burdened with an easement in favor of the public, and with the use of which, therefore, the legislature might fairly be presumed to deal without compelling compensation to the owner. And I am of opinion that if any authority for this application of the rule referred to is required, the case of Harrod v. Worship[24] furnishes us with one. In that case an act of parliament having imposed a penalty on any person who placed articles on \u201cany quay within ten feet of the quay head, or on any space of ground immediately adjoining the haven within ten feet from high water mark, so as to obstruct the free passage over it,\u201d it was held to apply only to ground on which there was already a public right of way, but not to private property not subject to any such right. Notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of the general terms used, it was not to be inferred that the legislature contemplated such an interference with the rights of property as would have resulted from construing the words as creating a right of way[25]. The case just quoted appears to be even stronger than the present and fully warrants us in adopting a construction so restricted as to save the statute from operating in derogation of private rights of property.\nFurther, it would appear to me, that the true rule of the common law as to the public use of floatable streams being that which the decision in Reg. v. Meyers had decided it to be, as already stated, we must read the first part of the first section as merely enunciative of the common law, and as introductory to the second section by which an important qualification and abridgment of the public rights was authorized by the erection of mill dams, which would but for the statute have constituted public nuisances, and then we are to consider the second part of the first section prohibiting the felling of trees or placing obstructions as introduced ex abundanti cautel\u00e2 to prevent any undue extension of the permission to erect dams into a recognition of a right to erect other obstructions. To put it in a familiar form, we may consider the legislature as saying: \u201cTrue it is that by law all persons may float rafts and timber down streams of sufficient natural capacity for that purpose, and no person can lawfully place any obstructions in such streams, but it is hereby enacted that hereafter such streams may be obstructed by mill dams, provided sufficient aprons or slides are made in the dams. But no other obstruction is authorized.\u201d I have no doubt that that was the sole object and intention of the Act, to restrict somewhat the rights of lumberers in the interest of mill owners; and in putting that construction upon it I feel confident that we in no way violate its spirit, but adopt a much more just and rational construction than if we held that, by the mere use of general words and comprehensive language, the legislature intended to authorize a gross violation of the rights of private property without in any way providing for compensation to its owners.\nThis is in effect the view of the statute which prevailed in Boale v. Dickson[26], which, I may say, was the decision of judges of such very high authority that even if I differed from the conclusion arrived at in that case, instead of entirely agreeing with it as I do, I should be extremely unwilling to overturn the rule of property law established by it after it has now stood unimpeached for twenty years, and after large sums of money have been expended in reliance upon its authority. Upon this point I refer to the observations of Lord Justice Thesiger in the case of Pugh v. The Golden Valley Railway Co.[27]\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, and the order of the Court of Appeal reversed, thus restoring the decree of the Court of Chancery, with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI take exactly the same view of this case as my learned brethren, and did not therefore consider it necessary to prepare a written judgment in this case. The law annexes to private property rights and privileges by which the owner of such private property can do with it what he pleases, provided he is not guilty either of a public or a private nuisance. That is one of the tests by which the rights of property, and of the owners of property, such as the appellant\u2019s, may be ascertained, and it is applicable to this case. The appellant in it is the legal owner of the streams and banks on which he undertook to construct dams and make certain improvements, and the only question is whether he had the right to the use of them exclusively. Under such circumstances, all we need inquire is, whether by the common law or by statute, his rights can be interfered with. Now I quite concur with the opinion just expressed by my colleagues as to what the common law is, and I am also of opinion that the legislature, when legislating in reference to streams and rivers in Upper Canada, only intended to make further provisions, that is to go a little beyond what might be considered the common law rights of the public, and provided for an easement whereby the public were authorized to use such streams and rivers for the purpose of floating timber in times of freshet during the spring and fall. It might have been a question otherwise whether outside parties would have been entitled to use such streams and rivers, it being only practicable to use them during such periods, and during such freshets at such seasons the streams were naturally capable of being so used. As the case on the evidence comes before us with the finding of the learned judge before whom the issues were first tried, I have sought in vain for evidence to bring me to the conclusion that the streams upon which the improvements were made by appellant, were such streams as to come under the operation of the statutes. The question seems to me to resolve itself into these enquiries.\nThe only means of interfering with private property is by expropriation for public purposes or subjects. One private individual cannot say to another who has the sole right of user of his property:\u2014\u201cYou have that property and I will force you to give me the use of it.\u201d He cannot compel the owner of such property to do so, even for a consideration offered to be given I know of no law that would give any such right. If, as it must be admitted, the appellant in this case cut a canal through his property, the law gives him the exclusive use of it, then, I do not see how the respondents can have any right to use the improvement made by appellant on these streams any more than he would have to use the canal. Taking this view of the case, I think the appeal should be allowed, and the decree of Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot restored.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI have arrived at the same conclusion, more especially for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne, whose notes I have had occasion to read. GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI find it impossible to arrive at any other conclusion upon the evidence in this case, than that arrived at by the learned Vice-Chancellor before whom the case was tried, namely, that in their natural state, and without the artificial means employed, and improvements made by the appellant, and those through whom he derives title, in the streams referred to at the places referred to, none of those streams were capable of being used for floating down logs and timber, even in times of freshets or high water, although the Mississippi, one of those streams below the places where the improvements upon it have been made, does come within the character of a stream navigable in fact.\nThat the appellant is seized in fee simple of the lands on either side adjoining the streams at the several places where the improvements have been made, is either admitted or sufficiently established in evidence. An objection taken to the evidence of his title to the lot adjoining the stream, at the place where the improvement called the \u201cBuck Stewart\u201d dam is erected, if there be anything in it affecting the absolute perfection of the appellant\u2019s title, cannot be entertained in this suit, for that the appellant was in possession of that land, qu\u00e2 owner in fee at the time of the committal by the respondents of the wrong complained of, is not disputed, and such possession is sufficient title against the respondents who are wrong doers, unless they can establish their main contention, which is\u2014that although the appellant may be seized in fee of the lands adjoining the several streams, at the places where the improvements have been made, still the beds of those streams are vested in the Crown for the public use, and that, in virtue of such seisin in the Crown, the respondents were entitled to float their logs and timber on the streams at the places so alone made capable of floating logs and timber by the improvements referred to, without any interference whatever offered by the appellant; and this right is asserted upon the basis: Firstly, that as is contended, the beds of all streams, large or small, in the Province of Ontario, are vested in the Crown under the provisions of the French law, as prevailing in the Province of Quebec, which, as was alleged, is different from the law of England in this respect, and are subject to the same public rights of user as like streams in the Province of Quebec; and secondly, that at common law, or at any rate, by force and effect of the Upper Canada statute, 12 Vic., c. 87, all persons have the right to use the streams in question at the places in question, for floating their logs and timber, without any molestation or interference upon the part of the appellant, notwithstanding that the streams were, at the places referred to, made capable of floating logs and timber solely by the improvements made and maintained by the appellant. Whether there is any difference between the laws of the Province of Quebec, and that of the Province of Ontario, in relation to streams of the character of those in question here, it is unnecessary to enquire; for that the Crown could, in Upper Canada, ever since the Act of 1791, constituting that Province, now Ontario, grant the beds of streams, such as those in question, and that a grant by the Crown, of land abutting on such streams, on either side, to one person, or to different persons, does, prim\u00e2 facie in the former case, pass the whole bed of the stream, passing through the land granted, and, in the latter case, does pass to each grantee the bed of the stream ad medium filum aqu\u0153 opposite the land granted, never has been doubted in the courts of Upper Canada; and that there is, or ever has been any difference between the law of Upper Canada and the law of England, upon this point, is a contention which cannot be for a moment entertained.\nIn Kains v. Turville[28] the late Chief Justice Draper says:\nThe law is too well settled to require any extended reference to authorities to establish the rule, that in streams and rivers which are not navigable, a description of land which extends \u201cto the water\u2019s edge\u201d or \u201cto the bank,\u201d carries the grant or conveyance of the thread of the stream, and that the description continuing along \u201cthe water\u2019s edge\u201d or \u201calong the bank,\u201d will extend along the middle or thread of the stream, unless, indeed, there be some words forming part of the description or introduced by way of exception, which clearly excludes whatever may lie between the water\u2019s edge or the bank, and the medium filum aqu\u0153.\nI will only refer to two authorities, one English, the other American In Wright v. Howard[29], Leach, V.C., says:\nPrim\u00e2 facie, the proprietor of each bank of a stream is the proprietor of half the land covered by the stream.\nIn Tyler v. Wilkinson[30] Story, J., says:\nPrim\u00e2 facie, every proprietor upon each bank of a river is entitled to the land covered with water in front of his bank, to the middle thread of the stream.\nSuch has ever been held to be the law of Upper Canada, nor is there a dictum or suggestion of any judge to the contrary.\nNow, as I have already said, it has been admitted or established in evidence, that the appellant, in right of title derived from the Crown, is proprietor of the lands abutting either sides of the streams in question at the places in question. Moreover, the descriptions contained in the Crown patents, granting the lands in question, have been produced, from which it appears that there is not contained in any of them any reservation of the beds of the streams or anything in qualify- cation of the grant of such beds, which the grant of the lands abutting upon the streams carries with it. In determining this case, therefore, we must proceed upon the basis that the appellant is seized in fee of the beds of the streams in question, at the places where the several improvements for rendering the streams capable of floating logs and timber have been made.\nThat very learned judge, the late Chief Justice Sir James Macaulay, thirty years ago, in the Queen v. Meyers[31], after a careful review of the English authorities and those of the United States, and of Rowe v. Titus[32], and Esson v. McMaster[33], decided in the courts of the Province of New Brunswick, arrived at the conclusion, that in the application of the common law to Upper Canada, in substitution for the old law of Canada, when inland streams are proved to be in fact, and in their natural state, navigable, they are, prim\u00e2 facie, public highways, by water, and that the public easement depends upon the fact of natural capacity, and not upon the fact of usage.\nIt is [he says] the adaptation, [by which he means the natural adaptation,] of a stream to the purposes of navigation, and not the being adapted in use, that renders it a navigable river; and usage [he says] after all is but evidence to prove the fact of capacity in relation to the thing as affording the easement claimed therein.\nAnd he concludes that since the Act of 1791, wherever an inland stream in Upper Canada is capable in its natural state of general and common use, as a highway by water, it is jure natur\u0153 subject to such easement, being enjoyed by the public, and that when streams are capable in certain parts to be used as public highways, though not in others, by reason of interruptions from rocks, shoals, and other natural obstructions, causing what are called portages, such streams, although being incapable of being used continuously, are, in the portions capable of being used in a state of nature, highways, although they are not in the parts where, by reason of the impediments, they are incapable of being so used. According to the judgment of that learned judge, the public right to use inland streams in Upper Canada as highways depended upon the natural capacity of the stream to be used as such, and was confined to those portions of the streams which in their natural state were capable of being so used.\nNow this judgment was pronounced four years after the passing of the Act of the Legislature of Upper Canada[34], and with a full knowledge therefore of the provisions of that Act, and from the whole judgment it is apparent that at that time, so recently after the passing of the Act, when the object of passing it would be fresh and present to the mind of the learned judge, it never entered into his head, that its objects or effect was to make private streams, which were not, in their natural state, capable of floating logs or timber, if made so by private enterprise, and a large expenditure of private capital upon private property, to become subject to an easement in the public, through and over the works and property of the person whose enterprise and capital had so enlarged the capacity of the streams, or that any person so improving the capacity of a stream, within the limits of his own property, as to give to the stream a capacity to float logs and timber, which by nature it had not, should be adjudged to be dedicating the works and improvements so made to the public use. Referring to the provincial statutes relating to the subject, he says:\nSome of those Acts are adapted to waters strictly private, and speak of dams legally made, which they could not be in obstruction of public highways by water; and others are intended expressly to authorize dams in streams manifestly regarded as public navigation, but in which the public interests are protected, if not promoted, by requiring the construction of locks, to be freely used, exempt from tolls.\nThe Court of Common Pleas at Toronto, in three cases, namely, Boale v. Dickson[35], Whelan v. McLachlan[36], and McLaren v. Buck[37], has held that the 5th section of 12th Vic., ch. 87, the section relied upon by the respondents here, refers only to such streams as in their natural state would, without improvements, during freshets and high water, permit saw logs and timber to be floated down them, and not to streams which, not having such natural capacity, have been given such capacity by the expenditure of capital by private persons upon their own property. This view appears to me to accord with the opinion of Sir James Macaulay, to be gathered from his judgment in the Queen v. Meyers, above referred to, and hitherto no doubt has ever, in the judgment or argument of any reported case, been cast upon the soundness of the above judgment bearing expressly upon the point; however, in the case now before us, the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Mr. Justice Burton dissenting) has held that the above decisions are erroneous, and in effect that the respondents, or any other person, have perfect right, without any permission, molestation or interruption from the appellant, to use the improvements made by him in the streams passing through his property, by which improvements alone the streams were given a capacity to enable them to float logs and timber. Apart from the imputation of arbitrary interference by the legislature with the rights of private property, without compensation, and the disregard of the established canon for the construction of statutes, which are claimed to have the effect of extinguishing private rights in the assumed interests of the public, which such a construction involves, a careful examination of that statute and of other statutes of the Legislature of Upper Canada, bearing upon the subject, leads, I think, to the clear conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario cannot be upheld.\nThe 9th George IV., ch. 4, which, as appears from its preamble, was passed, not only to give facilities to lumberers, but for the protection also of fish in certain streams, enacted that after the 1st May, 1829, every owner of any mill dam, which is, or might be legally erected, or where lumber is usually brought down the stream, on which said mill dam is erected, or where salmon or pickerel abound therein, should erect a good and sufficient apron or slide, in such dam of certain dimensions, specified in the Act in proportion to the width of the stream. The expression in this Act \u201cwhere lumber is usually brought down the stream,\u201d plainly, to my mind, indicates the intention of the legislature to have been, in so far as the interests of persons floating logs, etc., down the streams was concerned, to limit the application of the Act to such streams as lumber was usually, that is an a state of nature, floated down, the object of the Act being to prevent the obstruction of streams having sufficient capacity to float lumber, and not to provide means to enable lumber to be floated down streams, not having by nature such capacity. The Act 2 Vic, ch. 16, which was to prevent the felling trees into certain rivers mentioned therein as dangerous to mill dams and bridges, and impeding the navigation of the named streams, has no application to the present case; neither has 7 Vic., ch. 36, which was passed to prevent obstructions in rivers and rivulets in Upper Canada, occasioned by persons throwing slabs, bark, waste stuff, or other refuse of saw mills, stumps, and waste timber, or leached ashes into the rivers or rivulets of Upper Canada; neither has 10th and 11th Vic., ch. 20, which was passed to explain and continue 7th Vic., ch. 36, for by 14th and 15th Vic., ch. 123, which was passed to explain the two latter Acts, it was expressly enacted that neither 7th Vic., ch. 36, nor 10th and 11th Vic., ch. 20, did, nor did any part of these Acts, extend to any river or rivulet wherein salmon or pickerel or black bass or perch do not abound, so that these Acts were plainly passed for the protection of those fish.\nThe 12th Vic, ch. 87, is the Act upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case is rested. That Act, which was passed for the purpose of amending 9th Geo. IV., ch. 4, in its preamble, recites that \u201cit is necessary to declare that aprons to mill dams, which are now required by law to be built and maintained by the owners and occupiers thereof, in Upper Canada, should be so constructed as to allow a sufficient draught of water to pass over such aprons as shall be adequate in the ordinary flow of the stream, to permit logs and other timber to pass over the same without obstructions,\u201d and it enacted that from and after a day named it should be the duty of each and every owner or occupier of any mill dam, at which an apron or slide is by the said Act (9th George IV.) required to be constructed, to have altered and, if not already built, to have constructed, such apron or slide, so as to afford depth of water sufficient to admit of the passage over such apron or slide, of such saw logs, lumber and timber as are usually floated down such streams, and in the 5th sec. it was enacted, that it should be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, and that no person should by felling trees, or placing any other obstruction in or across such streams, prevent the passage thereof. Now this Act, by its preamble and first enacting clause, is expressly limited in its application to mill dams at which an apron or slide is by 9th George IV., c. 4, required to be constructed. This language involves a legislative recognition of the fact that there might be erected mill dams over streams, where no apron or slide was required to be constructed by 9th George IV., ch. 4, and a reference to the Act shows that in point of fact, it did not require an apron or slide to be constructed in any mill dam erected across a stream where salmon or pickerel did not abound, unless the stream was one whereon lumber was usually, that is, as it appears to me, in a state of nature, brought down; for lumber could not be usually floated down a stream, which in a state of nature was incapable of floating the lumber, so as to be brought down. The Act 12th Vic. ch. 87, recites its object to be to provide that aprons required to be constructed by 9th George IV., ch. 4, should be so constructed as to be adequate in the ordinary flow of the streams to permit saw logs and timber to pass without obstruction, plainly indicating, as it appears to me, the intention of the legislature to have been, to provide that streams, by nature capable of floating down logs and lumber, should not be prevented from doing so even by mill dams. The enacting clause therefore provides, that the apron or slide shall be so constructed, as to afford depth of water sufficient to admit of the passage of such logs, lumber or timber, as are usually floated down such streams, wherein such dams are erected, still referring to the streams as are referred to in the preamble, namely: streams down which, but for the obstruction caused by the mill dam, the timber usually was, and so could be, floated down. The 5th section appears to me to have been added lest the term \u201cusually floated down,\u201d should be construed to have a limited application, namely; to such, streams only as during the whole year were used, or were capable of being used, for floating logs, etc., and the object of the section was, inasmuch as there had not been in Upper Canada any practical decision as to what were the rights of the public, in streams capable of floating timber in periods of freshets, by the common law, as applied to the condition of Upper Canada, to declare by legislative enactment, that in all streams, during periods of freshets, the public should have the right (which, however, could be exercised only if the condition of the streams by nature would admit of it), of floating down logs and timber and that no person should by any obstruction interfere with the exercise of such right, and which but for such obstruction could have been exercised:\u2014a right which four years afterwards, the Court of Common Pleas, in The Queen v. Meyers, for the first time in the Upper Canada courts, declared that the common law, as applied to the peculiar condition of Upper Canada, was sufficiently elastic to secure, as a right existing jure naturae and not depending on the fact of user and acquirable only by prescription.\nIt is impossible to conceive that the legislature contemplated, by this language, to declare that, and, in my judgment, the language used is not capable of the construction that, it should be lawful for all persons during the period of freshets, to float logs, rafts, etc., etc., down streams which had not capacity sufficient to enable logs, rafts, etc., to be floated down them, even during freshets; or to prohibit persons from erecting dams, within the limits of their own property, over streams not having by nature such capacity, even during freshets, unless subject to the consequence that in the event of any such dam having the effect of making the stream, which by nature was incapable of floating logs, to become capable of being used for that purpose, as it passes through the property of the person erecting the dam over the stream, of the bed of which he was seized in fee; the stream so made passable through private property should eo instanti of the artificial capacity being given to it, become subject to the burthen of being a highway, open to the public, without the consent, molestation, or interference of the person whose enterprise and capital expended upon his own property created the artificial capacity of the stream, and without any compensation whatever to the owner of the property, who had constructed upon his own property the work which gave to the stream such artificial capacity. Such a construction cannot, in my opinion, be given to the Act, without an utter disregard of the plainest principles of justice, and of every principle ordinarily applied to the construction of statutes. But that the legislature in point of fact never did contemplate anything so unjust is apparent from the 16th Vic. ch. 191, and 18th Vic. ch. 84, by which the former Act was amended, and extended to Lower Canada. By these Acts it is enacted that any number of persons, not less than five, may form themselves into a company, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing and maintaining any dam, slides, piers, or other works necessary to facilitate the transmission of timber down any river or stream, or for the purpose of blasting rocks or dredging and removing shoals or other impediments, or otherwise improving the navigation of such streams for the said purpose, provided always that no such company should construct any such works, or interfere with any private property or of the Crown without first having obtained the consent of the owner, or of the Crown, except as in the Act is provided, as to the amount to be paid by the company to such owner for the privilege to construct such works by arbitration, in case of difference. And it was further provided that when any Company formed under the Act, should require any slide, pier or other work, intended to facilitate the passage of timber down any water, already constructed by any party other than a company formed under the Act, it should be lawful for the owner of such works (or if constructed on the property of the Crown, for the person at whose cost the same shall have been constructed), to claim compensation for the value of such works, either in money or in stock of such company at the option of the said owner, or the person at whose cost the same shall have been constructed, the value of such compensation in case of difference, to be also determined by arbitration. Then the companies were authorized to collect tolls, from all parties using the works.\nWe here find the legislature with scrupulous regard for private rights providing that no man shall be interfered with, in the full enjoyment of his property, without his consent, or without full compensation being made to him.\nNow if, as is here provided, no company formed under the Act, could acquire or interfere with the works constructed by this appellant without his consent, or without paying him full compensation, and if, as is also here provided, the companies could prevent all persons from using the works so acquired, unless upon the payment of tolls, it is impossible to hold, that by force of 12th Vic., ch. 87, all persons were entitled to use as public property works erected upon private property without the consent of, and in fact against the will of, the person who had constructed the works upon his own property. I am of opinion, therefore, that the plain natural and reasonable construction of the 5th sec. of 12th Vic., ch. 87, is that its object and effect is simply to prevent any person, even the owner in fee, of the bed of a stream, by any obstruction erected by him across the stream, to interfere with the free passage down the stream of such logs and timber as, but for such obstruction, could be floated down the stream, although such floating down could only be effected or take place during the period of freshets; the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, therefore, in the three cases above quoted, puts the correct construction upon the Act, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ontario, in this case, must be reversed, the appeal in this case be allowed, and the judgment of the Court of Chancery restored with costs to the appellant in this court and in the courts below.\nIn the view which I have taken of the Act, it is plain that the learned Vice-Chancellor acted quite right in refusing to receive any further evidence of the nature of that tendered by the respondents, his refusal to receive which has been objected to.\nAppeal allowed with costs[38].\nSolicitors for appellants: McCarthy, Hoskin, Plumb & Creelman.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bethune, Moss, Falconbridge Hoyles\n[1] 13 U.C.C.P. 337.\n[2] The Privy Council granted leave to appeal, and the case has been argued before the Judicial Committee and stands for judgment\n[3] 5 Ont.

Ritchie, Kt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMaster and owner\u2014Contract, Breach of\u2014Damages, Measure of.\nThe action was brought by G. against A. F. S. S. Co. to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff was master of the ss. George Shattuck, trading between Halifax and St. Pierre and other ports in the Dominion. She was owned by defendant company, the plaintiff being one of the largest shareholders of the company. Plaintiff's contract was that he was to supply the ship with men and provisions for the passengers and crew, and sail her as commander for $900 a month, afterwards increased to $950. The ship had been originally accustomed to remain at St. Pierre 48 hours, but the time was afterwards lengthened to 60 hours by the company, yet the plaintiff insisted on remaining only 48 hours, against the express directions of the company's agents at St. Pierre, and was otherwise disobedient to the agents, in consequence of which he was, on the 22nd May, without prior notice, dismissed from the service of the company.\nThe case was tried before Sir William Young, C.J., without a jury, who, considering that the plaintiff was not a master in the ordinary sense, held that he had been wrongfully dismissed and found a verdict in his favor for $2,000. A rule nisi was made absolute by the full court for a new trial. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\nHeld,\u20141st. That even if the dismissal had been wrongful, the damages were excessive, and the case should go back for a new trial on this ground.\n2nd. Per Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier and Gwynne, JJ., That the fact of the master being a shareholder in the corporation owning the vessel had no bearing on the case, and that it was proper to grant a new trial to have the question as to whether the plaintiff so acted as to justify his dismissal by the owners submitted to a jury, or a judge, if case be tried without a jury. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making absolute a rule nisi to set aside a verdict of $2,000 in favor of the appellant. The action was brought by appellant against respondents to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract.\nThe plaintiff was master of the steamship George Shattuck, trading between Halifax and St. Pierre and other ports in the Dominion. She was owned by defendant company; the plaintiff being the largest shareholder of the company. He was dismissed before the expiration of the term of his agreement.\nThe 1st count of the declaration was based on an agreement to hire the plaintiff at $1,200 a year while the vessel should be engaged on such voyages, and alleged a wrongful dismissal on 22nd May, 1878. The 2nd count declared on an agreement for six months, at $950 per month (to include supplies for the ship and wages for the crew), and wrongful dismissal during that period, and while performing the voyages prescribed. The 3rd count alleged a hiring for six months, from 14th March, 1878, and a dismissal on 22nd May, 1878. The 4th count alleged an agreement to hire plaintiff, as long as the steamer should be employed by defendant company at $1,200 a year and dismissal while she was so employed. The 5th count alleged that, by way of inducing plaintiff to take $4,000 in shares, the defendant company promised that he should have command of the steamer while she belonged to defendant company, at $1,200, a year, and wrongful dismissal during that time. The 6th count alleged an agreement that, in consideration of plaintiff paying $4,000 into the company as a sharesman, the company would give him command of any steamer which they might put in the trade; that he paid the money and became master of the George Shattuck, and also undertook to provide wages and provisions at their request, while they should employ the steamer, at $950 per month, and a wrongful dismissal before the expiration of the term. The common counts were added.\nThe 1st plea denied all the agreements. The 2nd denied all the grievances. The 3rd denied the employment. The 4th denied that plaintiff performed his duties. The 5th alleged negligence, carelessness and disobedient conduct on the part of plaintff. The 6th alleged disobedience and insubordination and refusal to obey the lawful commands of defendants and their agents, and insults to agents and improper and outrageous conduct. The 7th alleged that while the ship was in plaintiff's possession, defendants replevied her and dispossessed him, and that the replevin suit is still pending. To the common counts were pleaded never indebted and payment.\nOn May 26th, 1880, Sir William Young, who tried the cause without a jury, gave a verdict for plaintiff for $2,000. A rule nisi was taken for a new trial, and this was made absolute on 10th July, 1881. From this decision the present appeal was taken.\nMr. Thompson, Q.C., for appellant, relied on the following reasons in support of the appeal:\n1st. The conduct imputed to the plaintiff did not warrant the respondent company in dismissing the plaintiff before the termination, of his contract, while employed under such an agreement as that which had been made.\n2nd. The statements of misconduct were denied, and the verdict found this issue in favor of the plaintiff.\n3rd. The contract by which plaintiff became, for a definite term, master, and entitled to find the ship in wages and provisions, was not one which could be terminated for the reasons which the respondents assign.\n4th. The plaintiff's management of the ship having been faithful and satisfactory, and he being one of her owners and having a contract for a definite term, he was not removable for such reasons as have been assigned.\n5th. The reasons assigned by the plaintiff, and which have not been controverted, were such as to excuse the language and conduct attributed to him\u2014or, at any rate, to save him from the consequences of dismissal,\n6th. The respondents condoned the alleged misconduct.\n7th. The reasons which the respondents now assign for his removal are either offences which were condoned, or of which it does not appear that they had knowledge at the time of dismissal.\nMr. Rigby, Q.C., for respondents, contended\u2014\n1st. That the respondents were justified in dismissing him, and that the appellant, not being a part owner of the respondents' steamer, the latter had a right at any time to dismiss without cause and without notice.\n2nd. That the finding of the judge who tried the case as a matter of fact that the justification pleaded in the 5th and 6th pleas was not proved, is against all the evidence, or at least the weight of evidence.\nBut it must be observed that the finding of the judge was not an absolute finding, but was made with certain reservations, and in his judgment he characterizes appellant's language as indefensible. Besides, the learned judge considered the appellant to be a part owner in the steamer, and that the right of the owners to dismiss him was qualified by that fact, and also because he and his son had become stockholders in the enterprise, and the former had embarked all his capital in it.\n3rd. That the damages were excessive.\nIf the justification was not proved the utmost damages recoverable would be an equivalent for such a period of service as would cover a reasonable notice of such dismissal, which would be far below the sum awarded.\nBesides, in estimating the damages, the judge was influenced by circumstances which ought not properly to have been considered in relation to that question, such as the transactions between one Frecker and appellant at the original inception of the enterprise, the alleged interest of appellant in the ship, that he was not a master in the ordinary sense, and that he had embarked all his capital, a considerable sum to him, in the purchase and ownership of the vessel. These circumstances are urged in the judgment originally given by his Lordship after the trial, and more strongly insisted upon in his subsequent dissenting opinion.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI think this appeal must be dismissed. It is abundantly clear that neither the fact of plaintiff being a shareholder, nor what he may have done with a view to redeeming the concern and saving it from ruin, which seems to have so much influenced the mind of the learned Chief Justice who tried this case without a jury, should have, in my opinion, any bearing whatever on this case. This is simply an action by the plaintiff for an alleged breach of contract in wrongfully dismissing him from his situation as master of a steam vessel belonging to defendants. The contract appears to have been that defendants agreed to employ plaintiff as master of the ship, and that he should receive $950 a month for commanding and sailing the ship and finding the crew and passengers.\nThe simple questions involved are, first, did plaintiff so conduct himself while in command of the ship as master, as to justify the defendants, the owners, in dismissing him? And this is a question for the jury and should have been determined by the judge who tried this case without a jury. If so, there is an end of the action. But secondly, if his dismissal was not justifiable, then what damages is he entitled to recover? The learned Chief Justice did not pass on the first question pure and simple, but treating plaintiff \"not as a master in the ordinary sense,\" but under all the circumstances thought him entitled to a verdict, and that the sum of $2,000 was not unreasonable damages. The circumstances which influenced the Chief Justice appear to have been the fact that the vessel was owned by a corporation, and the master was a shareholder, for he adds to what I have just quoted:\nAs it was understood, however, that the case would be remitted to the court in banco, the amount of damages, as well as the questions of law as to the right of dismissal, and the distinction between the ownership of a ship by a body of individuals, the master being one of them, and by a corporation under an Act, would come up for adjudication after argument and full enquiry.\nThis question as to the ownership of the vessel, the captain being a shareholder, had, as I have said, in my opinion, nothing whatever to do with the case, as everything must turn on the contract entered into with the company, with which plaintiff's, interest in the ship as a shareholder had nothing whatever to do.\nBut, secondly, if the judge had found the dismissal unwarranted, there is nothing whatever to justify the amount of damages awarded. The true measure of damages in cases of wrongful dismissal are very plain and very simple, and in no circumstances, under the evidence in this cause, could plaintiff, on a monthly salary, under a contract by which he was not only to act as captain but was to find the crew and passengers for $950 a month, his wages as master being previously to his agreement $100 a month, be entitled to recover $2,000.\nThe court below were therefore quite right in granting a new trial, when the case can be submitted to a jury, or to a judge, if tried without a jury, as to whether the plaintiff so acted as to justify his dismissal, a question of fact for the jury. Secondly, as to the amount of damages, as to the measure of which the jury should be instructed as in the ordinary case of employer and employee.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe question of wrongful dismissal would have been one entirely for the jury, if a jury had tried this case; as it was, the question was one for the consideration of the learned Chief Justice, Sir W. Young, as a question of fact, and of the proper inferences to be drawn from facts; and upon the finding that the plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed, I should not be disposed to disturb his verdict. Making all allowance for the habits and manner of men of the plaintiff's calling, and taking into account his good service to the company and his undeniably good seamanship and management of his vessel, I think he was very harshly dealt with.\nThe damages, however, are unwarrantedly large; vindictive damages cannot be given in actions for breach of contract. The damages ought therefore to have been measured in the present case by the amount of the loss which the breach of contract occasioned the plaintiff, and as the hiring was a monthly one, a month's wages or $950 was the utmost which could properly have been allowed. I should be prepared to let a verdict for the plaintiff stand reducing the damages to this amount, but as the other members of the court think there ought to be a new trial, I do not dissent.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Ritchie, C.J.\nHENRY, J.:\nI agree with the views of brother Strong in regard to this question. I think it is a proper question for a jury. If the Chief Justice, who was sitting as a jury, had found for the plaintiff damages such as we could justify, I would have felt inclined to sustain the verdict, but I must say that under the circumstances I think, with the means we have of ascertaining what the damages ought to be, they are too high. Therefore, I consent that the verdict should be set aside.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis case was, as it appears to me, eminently a proper one to justify the court below in ordering a new trial. Whether the plaintiff was or not entitled to notice before being dismissed, depended upon his contract and the nature of his employment. This raised a mixed question of law and fact, which does not appear to have been tried. If entitled to notice, it could not, as appears, have been more than one month's notice, and then would have arisen the question whether the causes of dismissal relied upon and the evidence given thereof were sufficient to justify dismissal without notice. That was a point proper to be determined by a jury or a court of first instance acting as a jury, and does not appear to me to have been sufficiently considered. It is not a point proper for this court sitting as a Court of Appeal to adjudicate upon, as if it was a court of first instance. Then as to damages, the sole measure of damages applicable to the case appears to have been ignored. The only proper course to be pursued, as it appears to me, was to remit the case to be tried anew, as the ground upon which the learned Chief Justice proceeded in rendering a verdict for the plaintiff cannot, in my opinion, be supported. The plaintiff's appeal, therefore, against the rule absolute, ordering a new trial, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Thompson & Graham.\nSolicitor for respondents: Samuel G.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nTrade Mark\u2014Infringement\u2014Injunction.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nB. et al. manufactured and sold cakes of soap, having stamped thereon a registered trade mark, described as follows: A horse's head, above which were the words \" The Imperial al the words \"Trade Mark \" one on each side thereof; and underneath it the words Laundry Bar.'' \"J Barsalou & Co., Montreal\" was stamped on the reverse side. D. et ah. manufactured cakes of soap similar in shape and general appearance to B. et al., having stamped thereon an imperfect unicorn's head being a horse's head with a stroke on the forehead to represent a horn. The words \" Very Best\" were stamped, one on each side of the head and the words \"A. Bonin. 115 St. Dominique St.,\" and \" Laundry \" over and under the head. At the trial the evidence was contradictory but it was shown that the appellants' soap was known, asked for and purchased by a great number of illiterate persons as the \"horse's head soap.\" Held, (Henry, J., dissenting), reversing the judgment of the Queen's Bench (appeal side) and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, that there was such an imitation of the B. et al.'s. trade mark as to mislead the public, and that they were therefore entitled to damages, and to an injunction to restrain D. et al. from using the device adopted by them.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting at Montreal\nThis action was instituted before the Superior Court at Montreal, for the purpose of restraining the defendants (respondents) from making use of a trade-mark belonging to the plaintiffs (appellants) and for the recovery of damages thereby occasioned to the latter.\nThe plaintiffs alleged,\u2014\n\"That at Montreal in the district of Montreal on the 5th December, 1877, and for a long time before the plaintiffs manufactured and sold, at Montreal and elsewhere, in large quantities, a soap stamped with a horse's head, such as that upon the cake of soap filed by plaintiffs as exhibit No. 1;\n\"That after the plaintiffs had begun to manufacture the said soap and had long used as trade-mark for the sale thereof the stamp of a horse's head aforesaid, they sought and obtained from the Minister of Agriculture of Canada, at Ottawa, on the 5th December, 1877, the registration according to law, for the Dominion of Canada, of their said trade-mark, as appears by the certificate filed as exhibit No. 2\n\"That the plaintiffs were, at the said times, the sole manufacturers of the said soap bearing the said trademark or stamp of a horse's head; that they had and still have the exclusive right to employ the said trade-mark; and that their said soap, largely sought after by tradesmen and consumers in the Province of Quebec and elsewhere, was universally known by the said starnp of a horse's head \"That during the month of August, 1878, or there-about, the defendants, well knowing the foregoing facts, had, in fraudulent violation of plaintiffs' rights to the exclusive use of the said trade-mark, manufactured, sold and caused to be sold in large quantities at Montreal and elsewhere, a soap bearing a stamp made in imitation of plaintiffs' said trade-mark, to. Wit, the stamp borne by the cake of soap filed as plaintiffs' exhibit No. 3:\n\u201cThat this stamp which defendants have employed for the sale of their soap as aforesaid is a fraudulent imitation of plaintiffs' trade-mark and that defendants used the same with intent to deceive the public and to induce purchasers to buy their soap for that of plaintiffs, and to profit by the custom which plaintiffs had succeeded in gaining for their soap;\n\"That the defendants, in so using their imitation of plaintiffs' trade-mark had sold and caused to be sold a large quantity of their soap to persons who intended to buy plaintiffs' soap, the whole to the great prejudice, of the latter *\n\"That on or about the 28th August, 1878, plaintiffs notified defendants that proceedings would be taken against them for the illegal use they had made and were makings of the said fraudulent imitation of their said trade-mark; but that notwithstanding this notice, the defendants have since continued and still continue to use the said fraudulent imitation of plaintiffs' trademark;\n\"That the defendants, by reason of the above mentioned facts, have caused to plaintiffs, who own and operate at Montreal a large soap manufactory, damage to the extent of at least two thousand dollars; \"\nAnd the plaintiffs prayed that by the judgment to be rendered it be declared that defendants had illegally and without any right, made use of a fraudulent imitation of the plaintiffs' trade-mark; that they be enjoined to cease using the same or any imitation of plaintiffs' said trade mark and selling or causing to be sold soap bearing such imitation; and that, for the causes aforesaid the defendants be condemned jointly and severally to pay to plaintiffs a sum of two thousand dollars currency, by way of damages, with costs.\nTo this action the defendants, now respondents, pleaded,\u2011\n\"That the soap manufactured and sold by the defendants does not bear the plaintiffs' trade-mark, nor any fraudulent imitation nor any imitation whatever thereof; that their soap bears the stamp of a unicorn's head and not of a horse's head; that there is no resemblance between the words printed upon the soaps manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants; that the soaps have no resemblance, either in size, color or otherwise, and that the One could not be taken for the other;\nThat the soap manufactured by the defendants was manufactured only for one A. Bonin, and that in small quantities, and that in manufacturing their soap, the defendants had no intention of imitating, and have not in fact imitated, plaintiffs' trade mark.\"\nThere was also a plea of general denial.\nThe plaintiffs answered generally, and after proof judgment was rendered in the Superior Court, condemning the defendants to pay plaintiffs $100 damages\nThe defendants appealed from this judgment and had it reversed in the Court of Queen's Bench by whose judgment plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThe facts of the case and the evidence bearing on the case are reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given; the following will show the stamps used on the cakes of soap sold by the appellants and respondents respectively. On the reverse side of the plaintiff's stamp are the words \" J. Barsalou & Co. Montreal.\"\nMr. Beique and Mr. Geoffrion, for appellants, and Mr. Pagnuelo,Q.C., and Mr. Cruickshank, for respondents.\nThe points relied on and cases cited are referred to in the judgments.\nRitchie, C. J.:\u2014\nI think that the first judgment in this case was correct. I think that there was an infringement of the plaintiffs' trade mark. This appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the court below confirmed, with an injunction.\nStrong, J., was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed. FOURNIER, j.:\u2014\nLes appelants out poursuivi les intim\u00e9s devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour infraction \u00e0 leur droit \u00e0 l'usage exclusif de la marque de commerce imprim\u00e9e surchaque morceau de savon sortant de leur manufacture. Cette marque consiste principalement dans une t\u00eate de cheval d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et de l'autre dans l'arrangement de certains mots tel qu'il appert par les \u00e9chantillons produits comme exhibits en cette cause. Les appelants se sont assures le privil\u00e8ge de faire usage de cette marque par l'enregistrement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi concernant les marques decommerce.\nLes intim\u00e9s, qui sont aussi manufacturiers de savon, ont adopt\u00e9, comme marque distinctive de leur savon, un certain embl\u00e9me qu'ils appellent une t\u00eate de licorne Ils n'ont point pris d'enregistrement pour cette marque, Les appelants se plaignent que cette pr\u00e9tendue marque n'est qu'une imitation frauduleuse de leur propre marque de commerce; qu'elle constitue une infraction au droit \u00e0 l'usage exclusif que leur assure l'enregistrement et leur cause des dommages. Ils out pris les conclusions suivantes:\nA ces causes les Demandeurs concluent \u00e0 ce que par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir, il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les D\u00e9fendeuss ont ill\u00e9galement et sans droit aucun fait usage d'une imitation frauduleuse de la sus* dite marque do commerce des Demandeurs, \u00e0 ce qu'il leur soit enjoint de cesser de faire usage de toute imitation de la dite marque de commerce des Demandeurs et de vendee ou faire vendee du savon portant telle imitation, et \u00e0 ce que pour les causes susdites lea D\u00e9fendeuss soient condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer aux Demandeurs une somme de deux mille dollars courant \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats; le tout avec d\u00e9pens aux soussign\u00e9s.\nLe plaidoyer des intim\u00e9s peut se r\u00e9sumer en une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Limitation et l'intention de fraude sont sp\u00e9cialement ni\u00e9es. Pour justifier I'usage d'une t\u00eate de licorne les d'\u00e9fendeurs out donn\u00e9 dans leur plaidoyer le d\u00e9tall des circonstances clans lesqquelles ils ont adopt\u00e9 cette marque. De nombreux t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus d'une part, par les appelants, dans le but d'\u00e9tablir la ressemblance entre les deux marques; et de l'autre, par les intim\u00e9s pour faire voir que la difference entre elles est telle qu'un acheteur ordinaire ne pourrait les confondre. La question \u00e0 decider se borne donc \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation de cette preuve. S'il y a eu r\u00e9ellement imitation, qu'elle soit ou non accompagn\u00e9e d'intention frauduleuse, les droits des appelants doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\nAvant la signification de l'action, les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 requis d'avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9sister de 1 usage de la t\u00eate de licorne parce qu'elee \u00e9tait une imitation de la marque des appelants. Nonobstant cette demande ils ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire usage, ainsi qu'il est prouv\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de Brody, l'un des intim\u00e9s. Celuici reconnait aussi que lorsqu'ils ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fabriquer \u00e0 la demande de Bonin le savon portant la marque dont ii s'agit, ils savaient que les appelants vendaient un savon portant comme marque de commerce l'empreinte d'une t\u00eate de cheval. Ils en avaient des \u00e9chantillons dans leur \u00e9tablissement.\nLe deput\u00e9 ministre de lagriculture, M. J. C. Tach\u00e9, dont une des non moins importantes fonctions est celle de juger les contestations de cette nature est le seul expert competent qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 examine sur cette delicate question de la ressemblance des deux marques en question, et sur ce qui peut constituer une imitation suffisante pour \u00eatre contraire aux dispositions de la loi. Il s'exprime comme suit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nLa principale partie do la marque do commerce des Demandeurs comme question pratique est constitu\u00e9e par l'embl\u00eame qui repr\u00e9sente une t\u00eate do cheval et l'arrangement des mots qui entourent l'embl\u00eame font aussi partie de l'apparence g\u00e9n\u00e9ra1e do cette marque do commerce.\nA la question qui lui est particuli\u00e8rement faite sur Ja similitude qu'ily a entre les deux marques, il fait la r\u00e9ponse suivaute; R.\u2014Je trouve quo lune de c\u00e9s empreintes constitue une imitation de l'autre; les mots diff\u00e8rent mais leur arrangement est \u00e0 pen pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame. L'embl\u00eame qui caract\u00e9rise l'uno do ces marques do commerce \u00e9tant une t\u00eate de cheval et l'autre une t\u00eate do licorne, la seule diff\u00e9rence qui existe dans l'embl\u00e8me n'est constitu\u00e9e que par l'addition d'un simple trait place au front do la t\u00eate de cheval\nInterrog\u00e9 pour savoir si apr\u00e8s l'enregistrement de la marque des appelants ii e\u00fbt accod\u00e9\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s une marque de commerce semblable \u00e0 celle quills r\u00e9clame en cette cause, ii dit entre autres choses en r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 cette (question:\nJo crois cependant d'apres mon impression d'aujourd'hui, que si on eft fourni avec la description los doux pi\u00e8ces de savon qui sont ici produites et marqu\u00e9es exhibits Nos. 1 et 3, portant l'empreinte exhib\u00e9e, nous aurions refuse lo second enregistrement ou plut\u00f4t nous aurions notifi\u00e9 les deux parties d'avoir \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la preuve do priorit\u00e9 d'usage, d'apres la clause sixieme do l'acte dos marques do commerce de 1868\u00bb\nA la question de savoir si la priorit\u00e9 d'usage et suffi pour refuser l'enregistrement de la marque des intim\u00e9s, il donne la r\u00e9ponse suivante:\nLe cas e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile si on avait en pour so guider seulement la description technique des deux marques do commerce; mais Ia production do l'empreinte telle qu'elle so montre sur chacune des pi\u00e8ces do savon produites me para\u00eet prouver clairement l'imitation. J'ai fait faire une recherche dans nos livres par le commis charg\u00e9 do Ia besogne des marques do commerce et ii m'a dit ne rien exister qui nit trait \u00e0 la marque de commerce dos D\u00e9fendeurs.\nApr\u00e9s avoir donn\u00e9 en. r\u00e9ponee aux transquestions une description des deux marques de commerce, il declare dans une de ses r\u00e9ponses:\nThere is a difference in the depth of the impression, but I have no hesitation in stating that the two emblems are made in such a manner that ordinary purchasers may take one for the other.\nLes autres t\u00e9moins des appelants ont fait la. m\u00eame preuve. Barcelo trouve beaucoup de ressemblance entre Jes deux marques; Je trouve, ditil, qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral il a (le savon des intim\u00e9s) la m\u00eame apparence et que c'est une tr\u00e9s bonne imitation.\nIl consid\u00e8re qu'il pouvait vendre l'un pour l'autre. Le t\u00e9moin Corbeil trouve aussi que c'est une belle contrefacon.\nR\u00e9ellement, ajoutet-il, les gens peuvent se tromper bien souvent, surtout les acheteurs ordinaires, et prendre un savon pour l'autre.\nLuim\u00eame s'y \u00e9tait d'abord m\u00e9pris. Dans ses trans questions ii reconna\u00eet comme suit qu'il y a une certaine difference.\nOf course, there is a difference between the two soaps and I find a difference when I look at it sharp. The greatest difference between this kind of unicorn's head on Bonnin' s soap and the horse's head on the plaintiffs soap is the kind of horns on Bonniri's soap.\nHilaire Brais dit Desrochers prouve que le nomm\u00e9 Ald\u00e9ric Payette a voulu lui vendre le savon fabriqu\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s pour celui des appelants, Urg\u00e8le Perreault, \u00e0 la question s'il trouve de la ressemblance entre les deux savons, r\u00e9pond '.\u2014\nR\u2014Oui, il y a beaucoup de ressemblance avec le savon des Demandeurs, et ce qui me frappe davantage dans cette ressemblance, c'est la t\u00eate de cheval, car je trouve moi, que los deux morceaux portent Ia t\u00eate do cheval il m'est m\u00eame arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 moim\u00eame de m'y tromper; j'ai eu occasion, ii y a quelque temps, d'aller dans une grocerie chez un marchand en gros, je cross que c'\u00e9tait chez M. Ousson, mais je n'en suis pas sis pas set malgr\u00e9 que je vendais be savnndes demandeurs depuis longtemps, j'ai d'abord pris celui de M. Bonnin pour celui des demandeurs. Ce n'est qu'en y regardant de plus pr\u00e8s queje me suis aper\u00e7u de l'erreur queje faisais, et be marchand chea qui j'\u00e9tais m'a aussi fait remarquer que c'\u00e9tait en effet le savon de M. Bonnin, et non celui des demandeurs Je suis convaincu que je puis vendre tous los jours ce savon Bonnin pour celui des Demandeurs \u00e0 ceux qui demandent du savon \u00e0 t\u00eate do cheval, et je suis certain aussi qu'un grand nombre des acheteurs en useraient sans s'en apercevoir.\nLockerby, marchand en gros d'\u00e9piceries, interrog\u00e9 sur la ressemblance des \u00e9chantillons de savon dit:\u2014\nA.\u2014Well, this soap at the first glance a person would take Mr. Bonnin's soap for Mr. Barsalou's soap and to the consumer who couldn't read the lettering on them he would take the soap of Bonnin for that of Barsalou's the Plaintiffs.\nIf the two soaps were not side by side and no name on Bonnin's soap with this head as it appears here on the bar of soap, I could be 'led to believe that it was Mr. Barsalou's soap on account of the ressemblance of the head and the general appearance of the goods.\nRiendeau, commis, parlant de la ressemblance des marques, dit:\u2014\nJe consid\u00e8re par la marque de commerce, quo le savon Bonnin, produite cette cause, est une contrefa\u00e7on de celui des Demandeurs. Jetrouve assez do ressemblance entre los deux t\u00eates pour quo ce savon soit pris l'un pour l'autre en fait de marque de commerce, et je consid\u00e8re quo les acheteurs peuvent s'y tromper facilement s'ils n'examinent pas les \u00e9critures.\nA cest\u00e9moignages si positifs \u00e9tablissant l'imitation de la marque des appelants, les intim\u00e9s en ont oppose d'autres pour faire voir qu'il existe entre cette marque et la leur des diff\u00e9rences si caract\u00e9ristiques qu'un acheteur ordinaire ne saurait les prendre l'une pour l'autre Jen'en donnerai que quelques extraits, car la plupart de ces t\u00e9moins, comme ceux des appelants, s'expriment, quoi qu'en sens contraire, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les m\u00eames termes pour faire ressortir la diff\u00e9rence des deux marques.\nAlfred Bonnin, le premier t\u00e9moin des intim\u00e9s, que l'on peut consid\u00e9rer comme l'auteur de la difficult\u00e9 entre les parties, nous donne l'origine de la marque des intim\u00e9s. Voulant de-il avoir un aussi bon savon que celui de Strachan on des appelants, il a engage les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 fabriquer pour lui un savon de cette qualit\u00e9. S'\u00e9tant assur\u00e9 qu'il conviendrait \u00e0 son commerce, il a demand\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s quel embl\u00eame il conviendrait de mettre sur ce savon avec son adresse. M. Darling, fils do l'un des intim\u00e9s et leur teneur de livre, fit le dessin de la marque en question. L'ayant montr\u00e9e \u00e0 Bonnin, ce1uici s'en d\u00e9clara satisfait et ordonna d'en faire faire un modale. A l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a ordonn\u00e9 ce savon chez les intim\u00e9s, il avait cess\u00e9 de yendre celui des appelants qu'il vendait depuis environ six mois et en assez grande quantit\u00e9. Ce qui parait l'avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 faire fabriquer le savon portant son nom, c'est le refus qu'il avait essuy\u00e9 de la part des appelants de lui donner un escompte qui n'est accord\u00e9 qu'aux marchands en gros. Il leur a dit alors qu'il pouvait faire faire Un savon et l'introduire comme le sien. Il nie avoir dit qu'il allait faire faire une imitation du savon des appelants. Il consid\u00e8re que cette t\u00eate de licorne ne lui est pas beaucoup utile, qu'une autre aurait fait aussi bien, mais que vu que cette t\u00eate lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9e sur le dessin, ii l'a accept\u00e9e pensant qu'il \u00e9tait le seul qui avait cette t\u00eate de licorne. Il pr\u00e9tend que le savon des intim\u00e9s est plus connu par le mot imperial qui est, dit-il, plus facile \u00e0 dire pour les dames que t\u00eate de cheval. A la question suivante: \" Pensez-vous par exemple que pour les personnes qui ne savent pas lire le mot imp\u00e9rial frappe plus les yeux que la t\u00eate de cheval l Il r\u00e9pond:\nTant qu'\u00e0 cela, le mot imp\u00e9rial est connu et cola prend un homme expert pour juger si c'est une t\u00eate do cheval ou une autre t\u00eate.\nIl ajoute que la t\u00eate de licorne sur son savon ressemble, dans sa fa\u00e7on, autant \u00e0 la t\u00eate de licorne que la marque de commerce des demandeurs ressemble \u00e0 une t\u00e8te de cheval. Il y a une diff\u00e9rence sur le papier et sur le savon. En transquestion, il dit:\nI always have found a great deal of difference between the two as also in the size.\nI believe that no ordinary purchaser could be deceived in these two soaps; during five months that I have had my soap, no person has ever mistaken my soap for the Plaintiffs'.\nMalgr\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re positif de cette d\u00e9claration, il est difficile de croire \u00e0. la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de Bonnin.\nL\u2019id\u00e9e de faire fabriquer un savon portant sa marque ne lui est venue qu'apr\u00e8s le refus des appelants do lui accorder l'escompt\u00e9 qu'il voulait avoir. Le choix qu'il a fait de sa marque indique le d\u00e9sir defaire concurrence aux appelants. Darling, fils, lui montre plusieurs \u00e9chantillons de savon empreints de diverses marques; aucune no pent le satisfaire, pas m\u00eame la marque dune t\u00eate do licorne fort bien imit\u00e9e, que les intim\u00e9s avaient autrefois employ\u00e9e comme leur propre marque et qu'ils \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 lui donner. Cette t\u00eate de licorne ne pouvait remplir son but, parce qu'elle ne rassemblait pas assez \u00e0 la t\u00eate de cheval sur le savon des appelants. J.M. Darling, teneur de livres des intim\u00e9s, le t\u00e9moin qui \u00e0 fait des esquisses d'embl\u00e8me pour Bonnin, d\u00e9clare qu'un acheteur ordinaire ne pourrait \u00eatre tromp\u00e9 par la ressemblance des deux marques. Jo suis sassez port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que cola serait vrai si la t\u00eate de licorne sur le savon do Bonnin ressemblait tant soit pen \u00e0 la description qu'il donne d'une t\u00e8te de licorne:\nJ.M. Darling, teneur de livres des intim\u00e9s, le t\u00e9moin qui a fait des esquisses d\u2019embl\u00eame pour Bonnin, d\u00e9clare qu\u2019nn acheteur ordinaire ne pourrait \u00eatre tromp\u00e9 par la ressemblance des deux marques. Je suis assez port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que cela serait vrai si la t\u00eate de licorne sur le savon de Bonnin ressemblait tant soit peu \u00e0 la description qu\u2019il donne d\u2019une t\u00eate de licorne:\nThe head of a unicorn is surmounted with a horn which a horse has not and that a unicorn's head, in my consideration, is smaller and features sharper, and on the hole a very distinct animal,\nAu lieu do cela los \u00e9chantillons nous font voir que la pr\u00e9tendue t\u00eate de licorne n'est qu'une servile copie do la t\u00eate de cheval du savon des appelants, \u00e0 laquelle on a simplement ajout\u00e9 pour dissimuler l'imitation un trait qui est suppose figurer une corne. Un autre t\u00e9moin des intim\u00e9s, M. Adams, dit qu'en ne regardant quo la t\u00eate seule, on pout prendre cette pr\u00e9tendue t\u00eate de licorne pour une t\u00eate de cheval. Il croit quo la classe des consommateurs pauvres pourraient prendre lune pour l'autre surtout s'ils avaient la garantie ou la parole du vendeur. Dans ses transquestions, il dit quo cette t\u00eate pout \u00eatre tout aussi bien prise pour une t\u00eate d'\u00e2ne quo pour une t\u00eate de cheval. Cunningham tout en d\u00e9clarant qu'un acheteur ordinaire no pourrait confondre les deux marques, dit en transquestions quo si on lui montrait l'embl\u00eame du savon des intim\u00e9s sans le trait sur le front, qu'il ne pourrait le prendre pour la t\u00eate d'aucun animal. Comment concilier cela avec les d\u00e9clarations si positives qu'il n'est pas possible de confondre les deux marques. A. W. Hoods apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'il y a une, grande diff\u00e9rence entre les deux embl\u00e8mes, ajoute en transquestions que s'il n'y avait pas de corne, que tr\u00e8s probablement ii prendrait l'embl\u00e8me sur le savon de Bonnin pour une t\u00eate de cheval.\nQuoiqu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral les t\u00e9moins des intim\u00e9s s'accordent \u00e0 constater entre les deux marques de commerce des diff\u00e9rences telles qu'un acheteur ordinaire ne pourrait s'y tromper unbon nombre d'entre eux admettent aussi qu'en supprimant le trait qui simule la corne dans la t\u00eate de la licorne cette t\u00eate ressemble \u00e0 une t\u00eate de cheval. Foster, lui-m\u00eame, le graveur qui a fait l'embl\u00e8me en question et qui est si int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 nier l'imitation, ne peut s'emp\u00eacher d'avouer que s'il n'y avait pas de corne sur la t\u00eate ii y aurait une petite ressemblance avec une t\u00eate de cheval l qu'elle pourrait \u00eatre prise, s'il n'y avait pas de corne, pour une t\u00eate de z\u00e8bre ou \"m\u00eame de cheval ou pour celle de tout autre animal de l'esp\u00e8ce chevaline.\" M\u00eame pour l'artiste qui a fait cet embl\u00e8me ii y a ressemblance, \u00e0 plus forte raison doit-elle exister pour les acheteurs ordinaires au point de les induire en erreur. Il me semble qu'il n'y a pas d'autres conclusions \u00e0 tirer de toute la preuve que celle qu'il y a eu imitation de la marque des appelants. Si l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve pouvait offrir quelques difficult\u00e9s, l'examen des \u00e9chantillons les feraient dispara\u00eetre. Je partage enti\u00e8rement, sum ce rapport, l'opinion de M. J. C. Tach\u00e9 d\u00e9put\u00e9-ministre de l'agriculture, lorsqu'il dit:\n\"Mais la production de l'empreinte telle qu'elle se\n\"montre sur chacune des pi\u00e8ces de savon produites me\n\"para\u00eet prouver clairement l'imitation.\"\nBien que Bonnin soit le premier auteur de l'infraction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise au droit exclusif que les appelants avaient \u00e0 l'usage do leur marque, les intim\u00e9s n'en sont pas moins responsables quo lui. Ce sont eux qui ont fait faire l'embl\u00e8me d'apr\u00e8s leurs instructions. Ils \u00e9taient alors en possession \"d'\u00e9chantillons du savon des appelants. IL leur \u00e9tait facile do donner ou d'\u00e9viter la ressemblance. Avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invites par les appelants \u00e0 se d\u00e9sister de l'usage de la marque en question. Malgr\u00e9 cette intimation ils ont persist\u00e9 \u00e0 manufacturer du savon portant la m\u00eame marque. C'est donn\u00e9 en parfaite connaissance du tort qu'ils faisaient aux appelants qu'ils ont. continu\u00e9 l'imitation de marque et ils doivent en supporter les cons\u00e9quences. Faisant application des autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans le factum des appelants \u00e0 cette appr\u00e9ciation des faits, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action brought by the appellants to recover from the respondents damages for infringing a trade-mark registered and used to distinguish an article of laun4ry soap which they manufactured. Their trade mark consists of a horse's head over which are the words \"The Imperial\" and under it the words \"Trade-Mark\" the first of the two letter words being on the left side of the horse's head and the other on the right with the words \"Laundry Bar\" in a third line beneath. On the reverse side are the words \"J. Bavsalou & Co.\", and beneath them the word \"Montreall.\" An injunction was also sought to restrain the respondents from using a trade-mark they adopted upon soap of something of a similar kind, which they manufacture, as being like the trade-mark of the appellants. No judgment was given by the court of original jurisdiction as to the latter and none by the Court of Appeal and it was not asked for at the argument. The question is no- therefore before this court. The allegation as to the similarity of the two trade-marks is denied; and the respondents contend that the one used by them) is no imitation of that of the appellants, and that there is no probability, with the exercise of ordinary observation and intelligence, of the one article being taken for the other.\n\u00c0 great many witnesses were examined on both sides as to the probability of the one being taken for the other. The proof of the issue was on the appellants and great latitude was given to the witnesses, but no evidence was given that any one person had been induced to buy soap manufactured by the respondents for that manufactured by the appellants. The appellants have a large factory and were making their soap for upwards of seven years before the commencement of their action. The respondents, too, have a large factory and have manufactured several kinds of soap for upwards of thirty years, and similar in shape \"and general appearance but somewhat different in color compared with the cakes of soap made by the appellants.\nThey used various devices on the cakes of soap manufactured by them and about a year before the institution of the present proceedings, commenced to use one with the head of a unicorn.\nBefore doing so, they were applied to by one Alfred Bonnin a grocer, of 115 St. Dominique Street, to manufacture for him a superior article of soap, with his address impressed thereon, so as to serve him as a means of advertising his business. Bonnin proposed as a device a female head, but a clerk in the respondent's establishment suggested, amongst others, the head of a unicorn, which was agreed upon. It was also agreed to have the inscription \"A. Bonnin, 115 St. Dominique Street, Very Best Laundry,\" disposed in four lines to surround the device with no device or inscription on the obverse side. Thus the respondents' inscriptions were in four lines whist the appellants' were in three, and many of the letters of the former were cut longer and much finer than the respondents'. On the latter the words were all one side\u2014the other being smooth and plain\u2014 the two cakes presenting a strikingly different appearance, even to the eye of illiterate persons. With the difference indicated by the \u201chorn \" most conspicuously appearing on the head of the unicorn, the difference altogether is most apparent. Taking, then, the two, in view of the law as applicable to such cases, can we arrive at the conclusion that the trade-mark of the respondents is an infringement of that of the appellants' ? Is the one a literal copy of the other, or is it a colorable one so as to deceive persons of ordain nary intelligence when using ordinary care, so that when purchasing the one they would think they were purchasing the other? It must be remembered that no evidence was given that any person had been so deceived when purchasing; that the evidence of the appellants went no further than as a matter of opinion that parties might be deceived, the principal reason given being that the soap of the appellants was sometimes asked for as the h horse head soap \" and that the head of the unicorn being so much like that of the horse, illiterate people and children might be deceived. This is the strength of the appellants' case. It is freely and fully admitted that, taking the whole of the marks together, no intelligent person, who took the trouble to use ordinary observation, could be deceived; It is said that this soap is largely used by illiterate people who cannot read but the same might be said of a great variety of articles\u2014patent medicines, so .called, included. Suppose a medicine, called by any particular name, were put up with the same colored labels, wrappers on the bottles, the same kind of printing the same kind of bottles as those used by another previously; one, however, has the device of a church and the other that of some other building, alike in general appearance; but the latter has also the figure of a tower or steeple; each has the name of the manufacturer on it; could it be properly said the one was an infringement of the other, because ignorant people did not know that the tower or steeple was an important distinguishing feature, and that, being illiterate, they could not read, and profit by, the different manufacturer's names being printed on the bottles?\nIt is well known that illiterate people are often more instinctive in the practical knowledge they possess; and in the purchase of articles of constant daily consumption, they are generally harder to deceive than their more intelligent and educated neighbors. Besides, if they cannot read, they can see; and if one accustomed to purchase and use the cakes of soap of the appellants, even if not held to be bound to see the horn on the head would be bound, in my judgment, by the fact that those cakes had plainly indented marks on both sides while the respondents' cakes had all the marks on one side, the reverse side being wholly smooth. I am of opinion that the mere fact of the appellants' soap being called by some the \" horse head soap.\" should have little weight in the consideration of this case, particularly when one of the appellants' witnesses, who sold quantities of both soaps, swears it was not known or asked for as such as customers asked for s seven cent soap or Barsalou's soap \" and called it I Imperial,\" that when they wanted \" Bonnin's soap they asked for the six cent soap, and some for Bonnir's; and it is strange in this connection to find the appellants calling it \"Our Imperial Laundry Soap.\"\n\"We are to be governed solely by the two trade-marks as I feel satisfied, from the evidence, there was no intention of infringing the appellant's trade mark, for it is distinctly shown how the device was adopted, and if it were otherwise, why should the address of Bonnin have been stamped on the cakes? That would frustrate any object to sell it, as the appellants'. It was suggested that it was he who proposed and adopted the trademark, because the appellants would not ameliorate the terms upon which they had previously been supplying him; but the evidence negatives that suggestion, and by the whole evidence it is shown that Bonnin received from the respondents an4 sold all the cakes of soap so marked, and that he did not sell them as the manufacture of the appellants, but as his own. Samples of the two kinds of cakes were exhibited in the case, and inspected by the members of this court. I found no difficulty in ascertaining the difference in the two devices, and I cannot see how any other person, knowing the appellants' trade-mark, with reasonable diligence and ordinary eyesight, could find any, unless, indeed, they lived in a country where horses were found to have a horn in the centre of their foreheads. But, under any circumstances, the reverse side .of one being wholly smooth while the other had words indented upon it was a sufficient indication of difference to the most illiterate.\nThe appelants in their declaration allege that the respondents fraudulently imitated the horse's head, which is alone stated to be their trade-mark\u2014leaving out the words \"Imperial laundry bar \" and \"trade-mark.\" It appears to me that the words I Imperial laundry bar,\" at least constitute a part of it, and that the trademark is improperly described in the declaration, but which defect is cured I think, by the reference to the appellants' registry, as shown by their exhibit No. 2. That (document shows the trademark to include the other words I have just stated, and also to include the name of the appellants, &c, on the reverse side.\nTo such a trade mark the respondent pleaded, and denied all the allegations in the declaration as to their having fraudulently imitated it. It is alleged in the declaration that the appellants' soap was universally recognized by the said imprint or horse's head, but several of the witnesses who sold large quantities of it say that it was not so known, but as the I Imperial Laundry.\"\nIt is further alleged that the impression that the respondents used for the sale of their soap, is a fraudulent imitation of the appellants' trade-mark, and that the respondents used it with the intention of deceiving the public, and to make sale of their own soap for that of the appellants, and to profit by the custom secured or by the reputation that the appellants had the knowledge to acquire for their soap, and that the respondents had sold and caused to be sold a large quantity of their soap to persons who intended to purchase the soap of the appellants.\nIt is not necessary to show a fraudulent imitation of a trade-mark, where one is an actual imitation, because in the absence of evidence, that would be generallv assumed, but it might be shown not to have been fraudulently done. The owner of the trade-mark would in that case be entitled to an injunction, and also to recover at least nominal damages. When the complaint is made of a colorable infringement it is founded on a charge of fraud. That is not however, what is here charged against the respondents. They are charged with using the exact trade-mark of the appellants, and that is the issue raised, and the only One; and according to long and well--established rules of pleading, they should succeed or fail according to the proofs offered as to that sole issue. Were the charge for a colorable imitation, they should have set out in their declaration what the nature of it was. Both trade-marks should have been set out and described. In the English precedents that I have been enabled to consult and in the American also, such is the practice; and it is done so that, by a comparison of them, the court can ascertain whether in law it is such a colorable imitation as could possibly mislead, or where any doubt existed, so to direct a jury that they can find whether such charge is sustained. Suppose the respondents in this case had pleaded only a general denial of the appellants' allegations, and on the trial the appellants put in evidence the trade-mark of the respondents, there would have then appeared, in my opinion, an important and fatal variance. That is an important issue, and if found\u2014as it unquestionably should be\u2014for the respondents, they would be entitled to judgment in their favor. But it may be said that in another plea the respondents set out their trade-mark. To succeed they need not have done so and inasmuch as no colorable imitation is charged, the appellants could not recover, as such a remedy would be for a cause of complaint not alleged.\nBut, had such been the complaint, the charge of a colorable imitation, such as arises in this case must necessarily include a charge of fraud. in fact the word colorable necessarily implies a charge of fraud. From all the principles laid down in reported cases and by text writers on the subject in England and the United States, the action for a colorable imitation necessarily implies that the defendant was aware of the plaintiff's trade-mark, and fraudulently made such a change of a part or parts of it as would vary it; but still retain such parts as would leave the general aspect and appearance materially untouched. Some cases are reported in which it was decided that the change of the Christian name only, where both surnames were alike, was insufficient to authorize the use of the trade-mark of another and the same, in others where the change was made by adding or leaving out one or more words but the general appearance not materially altered.\nI have referred to the charge of a colorable imitation involving necessarily a charge of fraudulent intention, and it was held by Lord Chelmsford in Wotherspoon v. 7urrie ([1]) that where the two marks are not identical proof of a fraudulent intention on the part of the defendant must be given to entitle the plaintiff to relief\nIt is said by Mr. Adams in his treatise on the law of trade-marks ([2]) that:\nThe main thing to be taken into consideration is whether such an inspection of the defendant's mark taken as a whole, and having regard also to the mode of affixing it to the goods, and to all the circumstances attending its use, as a purchaser of ordinary intelligence exercising a proper amount of caution might be expected to bestow upon it, would lead him to suppose he was buying the manufacture of the plaintiff.\nOn this point I will quote the language of Lord Cranworth in The Leather Cloth Company v. American Leather Cloth Company, ([3]) and hereinafter pretty fully recited, when saying, that in such cases:\nThe maxim vigilaniibus non dormient\u00efbus leges subservlunt is not to be lost sight of, and even an unwary and incautious person must be exnected to bestow some attention upon the mark when purchasing an article.\nIn the same case Lord Cranworth says:\nThe gist of the complaint in all these cases is that the defendants, by placing the plaintiffs' trade-mark on goods manufactured by the defendants, have induced persons to purchase them, relying on the trade-mark as showing them to be of the plaintiffs'' manufacture. This necessarily supposes some familiarity with the plantiffs' trademark.\nWhen referring to the want of any evidence to show that any purchaser had been deceived I did not intend to assert that such evidence was absolutely required, but referred to the fact to establish the position that the case of the appellants is therefore weaker, and it is wanting in another important feature, which is, that none of the witnesses on the part of the appellants assert that taking the whole of each trade-mark as presented by the impressions on the cakes of soap, ordinary purchasers would be liable to be deceived. Some of them say that by looking only at the figure of the horse's head in the one case and of the unicorn's in the other they or others might be deceived, but that I hold in view of the principles laid down and acted on in the case just cited, should not be the test.\nThe question, in the case of a complaint for a color able imitation, in a common law court, that the fraud of the defendant is a necessary ingredient, may be considered as judicially settled. It has been ruled and decided that the imitation must appear as fraudulent In Crawshay v. Thompson ([4]), Chief Justice Tindal left the matter of the intention of the defendant in using the trade-mark to the jury \"because it seemed to him that unless there was a fraudulent intention existing (at least before notice) the defendant would not be liable \" The jury found a verdict for the defendants, and there was a motion for a new trial but the court held the direction right. In that case an attempt was made to make the defendant liable for the use of trade-marks without reference to his intention, but it was thoroughly canvassed and rejected by the whole bench. See Browne on Trade Marks ([5]).\nIn the Treatise on the Law of Trade Marks in En-land (1877) of Ludlow and Jenkins, the authors on this point say:\nBut although in the opinion of the authors the view the action depends on fraud is incorrect, still, as it has long maintained its ground, and has never in the common law courts been judicially abandoned, it is necessary for the practitioner to be acquainted with it\nAccording to the view which we are now considering, it becomes necessary therefore in an action for the infringement of a trade-mark to show.\n1.That the defendant asserted that which was false as by selling his manufactures as and for the manufactures of the plaintiff.\n2. That the defendant did this knowingly that is with the intention to pass them off as the plaintiffs manufactures.\n3.That the plaintiff has been injured.\nEvery case of putting another trade-mark on one's own goods is not actionable. It must be put on with the intention to deceive\nIn Edelston v. Edelston ([6]), Lord Chancellor Wesibury, when giving judgment, said:\nAt law. the proper remedy is by an action on the case for deceit; and proof of fraud on the part of the defendant is of the essence of the action. But this court will act on the principle of protecting property alone, and it is not necessary for the injunction to prove fraud in the defendant.\nIn equity the rule is different in this respect from that of the Common Law Courts. This is essentially an action brought in a common law court irrespective of equity jurisdiction, and must be so dealt with.\nThe Dominion statute 81 Vic. ch. 55 which provides for the registry of \"Trade Marks,\" imposes penalties for the use of another persons trade mark and for the close imitation of it so as to deceive ordinary purchasers. In a succeeding section is reserved the right of action by the proprietor of a trade-mark against any person using his registered trade-mark or any fraudulent imitation therefore, or selling articles bearing 8uch trade-mark or any such imitation thereof.\"\nTo sustain an action under the statute for using a trade mark, a fraudulent intention is not required to be shown, but no action for an imitation lies under it unless it is found to have been done fraudulently The statute is therefore but an affirmance of the common law on the subject. In all the cases in the Common Law Courts, I have had an opportunity of seeing where the complaint was not for the use of a trade-mark, but for a simulated imitation of one, fraud was charged, and in all the cases where the plaintiffs were successful, it was found.\nIf, then, such be the state of the law, we must consider the circumstances under which the respondents adopted and used their trade-mark. They did not manufacture the particular kind of soap when applied to by Bonnin\u00ec but, having been applied to they agreed to make the article for him. They adopted the trade-mark, as is proved by one of the partners, called as a witness by the appellants, without any reference to that of the appellants. That statement is fully sustained by Bonnin, another witness called by the appellants and also by the son of one of the defendants and their statements being un-contradicted should be received as true. That position is, also, sustained by Bonnin, who states that he never intended to, or did sell any of the soap as that made by the appellants; and also by the fact that no evidence was given to show that any person bought Bonnin's soap for that of the appellants. It is admitted the respondents and Bonnin knew the appellant's trade-mark; but, from all the surrounding circumstances as furnished by the evidence, I have no difficulty in concluding that in adopting the trade-mark neither the respondents nor Bonnin had any intention of making fraudulently a simulated imitation of that of the appellants. If fraud is necessary to be established and the authorities show that it is, I am clearly of the opinion that the evidence calls for a finding that it did not exist on the part of the defendants in this case.\nBut admitting that the rule in equity should govern in the common law courts, we must next decide whether there was really such a similitude between the two trade-marks as would make the respondents liable. Browne in his treaties on trade-Mark says: ([7])\nIt is frequently a difficult matter to determine what is an infringement. The two marks which are supposed by the plaintiff in a case to conflict may resemble each other and yet be different The question then arises is the difference only colorable ? No general rule can be laid down as to what is or what is not a mere colorable variation. All that can be done is to ascertain in every case as it occurs whether there is such a resemblance as to deceive an ordinary purchaser. using ordinary caution.\nSee for his authority Lord Cianworth ([8]).\nAccording to that authority, the rule, which is always applied is in substance that the resemblance must be such as to deceive an ordinary purchaser using ordinary caution. Evidence on the part of the appellants was given by witnesses, all of whom, I think, could read; and, although saying they would not themselves be deceived, gave it as their opinion that parties who could not read might be. As some intimacy with the trade-mark said to have been imitated is necessairi y assumed, I have already shown two important features by which illiterate persons who could not read could frustrate an attempt to deceive them in regard to the soap of the appellants, the one the horn conspicuously shown on the unicorn's head and the other that in the case of Bonnin's soap the trade-mark is all on one side of the cake\nIn the treatise last cited ([9]) the author says:\u2014\nNow, although a court will hold any initiation colorable which requires a careful inspection to distinguish its marks and appearances from those of the manufacture imitated, it is certainly not bound to interfere when ordinary attention may enable a purchaser to discriminate. And again it does not suffice to show that persons incapable of reading the labels bearing the mark, might be deceived by the resemblance. It must appear that the mass of ordinary purchasers paying that attention that such persons usually do in buying the article would be deceived, Partridge v. Menck. ([10])\nThe latter I hold to be the true interpretation of the law in the case to which it refers and if so there is not the slightest evidence to sustain the case of the appellants. Its main strength consisted of evidence, (not of experts or illiterate parties themselves), given by persons who said they would not have been deceived but that persons unable to read were likely to be. In none of the English or American cases that I have found is such a position taken; nor can I think it could in any case be properly allowed to influence a decision In this case, however, the testimony of the appellants'' witnesses is more than neutralized by that of about double the number on the other side, who state that there would be no likelihood of any one using ordinary caution being deceived.\nThe weight of evidence strongly preponderates on this important point in favor of the respondents.\nI will hereafter cite, at some length, as bearing upon this case the \"judgment in the Rouse of Lords, in what is called \"the case of the Leather Companies,\" before referred to ([11])\u2014the decision in which was against the plaintiff\u2014because the trade-marks of the two parties in that case were in their general character and features relatively to each other more like those in this case than in any other case I could find. The proceedings in that case were in equity for an injunction. The Vice-Chancellor decided in favor of the plaintiff, but the Lord Chancellor reversed the judgment and the case was taken on appeal to the House of Lords. See also the case of Denis & Mounier Vighnier, Dodart & Co., cited in Browne on Trade Marks ([12]), and referred to by Mr. Justice Gross in his judgment. Lord Cranwoth:\nThe defendant's trade mark is certainly not the same as that used by the appellants. But it is only colorable diff\u00e9rent? I think it is so different as to make it impossible to say that it is substantially the same. No general rule can be laid down as to what is or is not a mere colourable variation. All which can be done is to ascertain in every case as it occurs, whether there is such a resemblance as to deceive a purchaser using ordinary caution. Here the differences are so palpable that no one can be deceived. In the first place the shape is different. The plaintiff's trade-mark, if trade-mark it is to be called, is contained in a circle. The design of the defendants' is a semi-circle mounted on a parallelogram. It is said that the defendants' goods may be so rolled as to expose only the semi-circle and so lead to the belief that the device in its integrity is a circle, I answer vigilantibus non dormientibus, leges subserviunt. There might, however, be some force in the observation if the upper half was the same as, or even if it closely resembled the upper half of the plaintiff's device. But this is not so. The name of the company is diff\u00e9rent. The word \"Crockett\" is prominently exhibited twice in the plaintiff's upper half; not once in the defendants. No one taking the trouble to read the two can say that he would be deceived\nThe gist of the complaint in all these cases is, that the defendants, by placing the plaintiff's trade-mark on goods manufactured by the defendants, have induced persons to purchase them, relying on the trade-mark as proving them to be of the plaintiff's manufacture. This necessarily supposes some familiarity with the trade mark. But to any one at all acquainted with the plaintiff's trade-mark in this case, I can hardly think that, even on the most cursory glance, there could be any deception.\nEach of the trade-marks, it is true, as well that of the plaintiffs as that of the defendants, contain within its periphery an eagle, or that which we suppose was meant to represent an eagle, but not at all resembling each other. The rest of the device if it is to be called a device, consists merely of words intended to indicate the nature or quality of the article, the place of its manufacture, and the names of the manufacturers No one readings the two could fail to see that they differ in all these particulars. The letters are all printed in very large type and the diameter of the circle which contains them is above six inches, so that there can be no difficulty in deciphering what is stamped.\nI mention this because, if, instead of occupying the large space, the whole had been engraved on a stamp of the size of a sixpence or a shilling. so as not to be capable of being read without a magnifying glass, or even without close examination, the case might have been different. A person purchasing leather cloth so stamped might perhaps fairly say, \"\u00ed did not attempt to decipher what was stamped on the article which I bought. I saw it had on it what appeared to be, and what I could not discover not to be, the plaintiff's stamp, and I therefore took it for granted, it was the produce of-his manufactory.\" But this cannot apply to a case like that now before us. where that which is called a trade-mark is, in truth, an announcement of the names of the manufacturer, the style of the firm, and the place of the manufacture, in large letters, not only capable of being easily read but intended to be read by all to whom the goods are exposed for sale.\nThe object of the plaintiffs in the use of their device was to announce (I do not say unfairly or dishonestly to announce) to purchasers that they were buying goods manufactured at what was the original International Leather Cloth Company, at West Ham, carried on by Messer. Crockett. I do not think that a firm using device by way of trade-mark can say that a rival manufacturer is guilty of an infringement when he has adopted a device differing in shape, and announcing in letters equally large and legible, the name of a different firm manufacturing goods at a different place. On this short ground I think that the appeal Ought to be dismissed with costs.\nLord Kingsdown says.:\nMy lords, there are two questions to be decided in this case: first, whether the plaintiffs, the present appellants, have proved their allegation that their right to the exclusive use of what is called their trade-mark has been violated by the defendants; secondly, it that fact be established, Whether there are such misrepresentations made by the plaintiffs in their trade-mark as to disentitle them to protection in a court of equity. The rules of law applicable to both questions are sufficiently clear and simple\u00bb though some difference of opinion seems to prevail as to the precise principles on which they rest; and great difficulty is often found in applying (in this as in other matters) known rules to the facts of particular cases.\nThe fundamental rule is, that one man has no right to. put off his goods for sale as the goods of a rival trader, and he cannot, therefore (in the language of Lord Langdale, in the case of Perry v. Truefit ([13]), be allowed to use names, marks, letters, or other indicia, by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person.\" A manmay mark his own manufacture, either by his name, or by using for the purpose any symbol or emblem which comes by use to be recognized in trade as the mark of the goods of a particular person, no other trader has a right to stamp it upon his goods of a similar description. This is what I apprehend is usually meant by a trade-mark, just as the broad-arrow has been adopted to mark Government stores a mark having no meaning in itself, but adopted by and appropriated to the Government.\nThe plaintiffs' trade-mark, or what they call such, is of a different description, and, under the second question for consideration, the difference may be material, but for the first question it does not seem to me to be so.\nIn dealing with this point, it may be useful to consider, firth, what representations, the defendants had a right to make, and next, what representations they actually have made. The leather cloth, of which the manufacture was first invented or introduced into this country by the Crocketts, was not the subject of any patent. The defendants had a right to manufacture the same article, and to represent it as the same with the article manufactured by Crocketts. And if the article had acquired in the market the name of Crockett's leather-cloth, not as expressing the maker of the particular specimen, but as describing the nature of the article by whomsoever made, they had a right in that sense to manufacture Crockett's leather-cloth and to sell it by that name. On the other hand, they had no right, directly or indirectly, to represent that the article which they sold was manufactured by Crocketts, or by any person to whom Crocketts had assigned their business or their rights. They had no right to do this, either by positive statement or by adopting the trade-mark of Crocketts & Co., or of the plaintiffs to whom Crocketts had assigned it, or by-using a trade-mark so nearly resembling that of the plaintiffs as to be calculated to mislead incautious purchasers.\nThese being, as I conceive the rights of the defendants, and the limits of those rights, what is it that they have actually done, and in what respect have they infringed the rights of the plaintiffs ?\nThat depends upon the question, how far the defendants' trade-mark bears such a resemblance to that of the plaintiffs' as to be calculated to deceive incautious purchasers. if we compare the statements of the two trade-marks there is no statement in the one which can be considered as identical with, or indeed as resembling, the other, except this, that both profess to sell leather-cloth,\u2014a profession which both have a right to make.\nThe defendants describe their articles as L Leather cloth, manufactured by their manager lato with J.R. & C. P. crockett & Co.,\" clearly showing that they do not pretend that their cloth is manufactured by, that firm, or by any persons who have succeeded in business to that firm. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, describe their article as u Crockett & Co's. tanned leather-cloth, patented 24th January, 1856. J. R, & C. P. Crockett manufacturers.\nNeither in the description of the article to be sold nor of the makers is there anything to be found which could induce any person of common sense to suppose, that in buying the defendant's goods he was buying what had been manufactured by the plaintiffs. But it is said that, in the form of the stamp, the adoption of the American Eagle as an emblem and the collocation of the words \"J. R. & C. P. Crockett & Co.\", there is an obvious imitation of the plaintiff's mark,. likely to lead to a mistake of the defendants' goods for the goods of the plaintiffs.\nOn comparing the two stamps, there does not appear to me to be any such general resemblance as is relied on nor do l think that there was, in truth, any intention to produce such result, though the intention is immaterial if the result he produced.\nI think that the object of the defendants was of another kind; that their object was not to represent their company as the plaintiff's company or their goods as the plaintiffs goods, or to produce any confusion between the two but to represent themselves as a rival company, manufacturing and selling the same article with the plaintiff's, viz. the leather cloth invented or supposed to have been invented by Crockett's, in America, and which they desire to recommend to customers, holding out that it is manufactured, not by Crockett's, but by persons who, having been in the employment of Cockett's, may be supposed to have acquired complete knowledge of their process. Now, these representations are no infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s rights; and the purpose which I have supposed, accounts for the similarity, as far as there can be said to be any similarity between the trade-marks of the two companies. The defendants wish to represent that their business consists in manufacturing and selling, not merely leather cloth, but the particular leather cloth invented in America by crockett & Co. and they therefore, take the name of the American Leather Cloth Company. For the same reason they adopt the American Eagle as a badge, but their figure has not the smallest resemblance to the same emblem on the plaintiff's representation. For the same reason they refer, ii prominent characters, to J. R. & C. P, Crockett.& Co. for the purpose of shewing that they manufacture the same article which Crocketts manufactured, and have the means of using the same processes which Crocketts is used, by the employment of a person who was in the service of these gentlemen.\nIf this statement be true the defendants are justified in making it: but it it be untrue, however reprehensible the statement may be it does not constitute a colorable imitation of the plaintiff's trade-mark or amount to an infringement of their rights. I think. therefore, that the plaintiffs have failed in proving the fact which forms the foundation of their case and in establishing any ground for the interference of the court; and that for this reason, if for no other, the appeal must be dismissed.\nLord Chancellor:\u2014\nMy lords, what is here called by the appellants a \"trade-mark,\" is, in reality an advertisement of the character and quality Of their goods; and dropping for a moment all reference to the incorrect and untrue statements contained in that advertisement I will take only what is called the \" trade-mark,\" of the plaintffs and the rival or antagonistic trade-mark of the defendants, and compare them together, taking them as if they were simply, what in reality they are, two advertisements, each affixed by way of label to the articles manufactured by the parties respectively. Now, comparing them merely as advertisements, and taking them in that character alone, and we shall at once find that there are a variety of statements contained in the advertisement of the appellants which aie not to be found in any form, direct or indirect, in the advertisement of the respondents\nMy lords, this advertisement is the sole foundation of the plaintif's case, and their allegations must be reduced, in substance to this\u2014that, having advertised and described their goods in a particular manner, the defendants have borrowed their advertisements, and described their goods in substantially the same manner. Let us see, then whether that is all correct In the first place the plaintiffs in their advertisements, describe their manufacture as \" Crockett & Co s Leather Cloth.\" The sole denomination applied by the adver tisement of the defendants is i\"Leather Cloth \" (which was perfectly well known, independently of Crockett & Co.'s cloth). Further, the plaintiffs state, not only that they make and sell Crockett & Co.'s leather cloth, but that it is \"tanned leather cloth,\" an allegation to which there is nothing whatever similar or corresponding in the advertisement of the defendants. Further, the appellants represent that their article is the manufacture of J. R. & C. P. Crockett for they are described as the manufacturers. Not only is there nothing correspondent to that in the advertisment of the defendants, but what the defendants assert is simply, not that it is manufactured by Crockett & Co. but that it is manufactured by their manager, who was formerly in the employ of J. R. & C.P. Crockett & Co. If, therefore, these are regarded as being what in reality they are. representations of two different articles, it is impossible to say that the representation which is contained in the advertisement of the one contains, either identically or substantially, the representations which are contained in the advertisement of the other: and if you drop the statement in words, and take only the symbols employed in the one case and in the other it will be found that they differ entirely in their character and effect in the two cases. In the one case it will be seen that you have the eagle with the wings fully extended; in the other case you would have that which is called, I believe, in America, the \"screaming eagle,\" armed with his talons, and perfectly different in character and shape from the other. There is also another, which seems to be intended to be a representation of a sparrowhawk, which, again, is very different from the others\nMy Lords, I have added these few observations for the purpose of showing, not only that the ground which I took in the court below was a ground sufficient for my decision, but also that the grounds which have now been superadded by my noble and learned friends and which I regret I did not more fully consider and adopt as the basis of my former judgment, would warrant the same conclusion and would, perhaps, have tended still more in favor of the defendants. My Lords, I concur entirely in the motion that has been made, that this appeal be dismissed, with costs.\nA fac-simile of each trade-mark is given in the report and, comparing them with the exhibits of the cakes of soap in this case, the former are at once seen to bear a much stronger general resemblance to each other than do the latter to each other\nLooking at the trade-marks in this case in the light of the views entertained and expressed by Lord Chan-cellor Westbury, and the two other eminent and distinguished jurists, as above quoted we should find that in this case there was no imitation of the appellants' trademark. Mr. Justice Cross very properly says:\u2014\nThe inscription has no kind of resemblance to that on Mr. Barsa-lou & Co.'s soap, there being but the one word ''Laundry \" used in common, all the others being different.\nIn the case of the leather companies both trade-marks included the figure of an eagle but it was held thatthere was such a difference as to their appearance, as to require purchasers to discriminate. It was contended that being figures plainly of an eagle, parties might be deceived, but the three learned judges held there was a sufficient variation. The distinctive features were not, I hold, as great in that case, as would be apparent as between the horse's head and that of the unicorn's in this,\nAs this is the first case that has come before this court on the subject of trade-marks, and as the matter is one of great importance in connection with the manufacturing and trading interests of the country, I have felt the obligation of dealing fully with the subject and have advisedly arrived at the conclusion that, by sustaining the claim of the appellants, we would put an unnecessary and improper restraint on the industry and trade of the country, and do injustice to the respondents.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed and the indument below affirmed with costs.\nTaschereau J.:.\u2014\nAs well remarked by Mr. Justice Cross, in rendering the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, \"any difficulty in the case arises more from the appreciation and applicability of the evidence to the particular case than doubt as to the principles of law which should govern it.\nIf I do not misunderstand the reasons given by the learned judge, there can be no dissent from the law as laid down by him, viz., that the imitation of a trademark to be illegal must be such as to mislead the public into taking the one for the other. But It is in its application to the facts in evidence in this case and in its determination that there is here no illegal imitation, that I feel constrained to dissent from the jugement appealed from and to adopt the conclusion of the learned judge who gave the judgment in the first instance.\nThe facts of the case have been summed up by my brother Foumier, and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them here. They, in my mind, clearly show that any ordinary purchaser, any one whose attention had not been drawn to the difference between the two soaps any illiterate person who desired to buy the soap called the \"Horse's Head Soap,\" and who did not known that there was a unicorn's head as well as horses head soap might very easily be deceived and take one for the other.\nIt is sufficient, says the Cour Imperial of Paris, (decision of March 21st, 1866, Sirey ([14]), to consider an imitation of a mark or of a label fraudulent that the imitation be of a nature to create confusion and to deceive the purchaser even when there exist certain differences of detail such as a modification in the de-nomination of the product, and of the indication of the maker's name.\nIn the former case there is an indication of the maker's name on the respondent's soap; but what difference is this for a person who cannot read as is the case with a large number of those who buy these soaps\nAnd as held in another case ([15]): \"In order that there be a fraudulent imitation of a trade-mark .. it is not necessary that the imitation be servile it is sufficient that it be of a nature to deceive the purchaser.\"\nI refer also to the following cases:\u2014\u2014\nBlofield v. Payne ([16]); Seixo v. Provezenda ([17]); Singer's case ([18]); Orr-Ewing v. Johnston, ([19]); Civil Service v. Dean (1); MacRae v. Holdsworth (2); Hull v. Barrows (3); Edelston v. Edelston (4); Hall v. Barrow (5); Read v. Richardson (6); Barron v. Lomas (7); Crawford v. shuttock (8)\u2014a case as this one on trade-marks in the manufacture of soap; Davis v. Reid (9).I am of opinion to allow the appeal, with costs, and to restore the judgment given by the Superior Court against the respondent\u2014one hundred dollars, with costs of suit.\nAppeal allowed, with costs.\nAttorneys for appellants: Beique & McGoun.\nAttorneys for respondents: Cruickshank & Cruickshank.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n",

J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMarine insurance\u2014Policy, conditions in, as to default in payment of premium, effect of\u2014Premium note, guarantee of, in case of insolvency\u2014Condition precedent\u2014Reference to arbitration\u2014Award, effect of.\nW. et al effected in A. M. ins. Co. a policy of insurance on a ship. The policy among other clauses contained the following: \"In case the premium, or the note, or other obligation given for the premium, or any part thereof, should be not paid when due, this insurance shall be void at and from such default; but the full amount of premium shall be considered as earned, and shall be payable, and the insurer shall be entitled to recover for loss or damage which may have occurred before such default. Should the person or any of the persons liable to the company for the premium, or on any note or obligation given therefor, or any part thereof, fail in business or become bankrupt or insolvent before the time for payment has arrived, this insurance shall at once become and be void, unless and until before loss the premium be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company.\"\nThere was also in the policy an arbitration clause by which arbitrators were to decide any difference which might arise between the company and the insured \"as to the loss or damage or any other matter relating to the insurance\" in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy and the laws of Canada, and the obtaining of the decision of the arbitrators was to be a condition precedent to the maintaining of an action by the insured against the company.\nW. et al gave a promissory note for the premium, which was not yet due when they became insolvent: and C., the respondent, was appointed assignee. A guarantee was then given and accepted by the company as a satisfactory security for the premium. The note became due on the 30th September, 1878, and was not paid but remained overdue and unpaid at the date of the loss on the 12th of October, 1878. After the loss the matters in dispute arising out of the policy were submitted to three arbitrators, who awarded $5,769.29. An action was then brought on the policy, the declaration containing a count on the award.\nHeld,\u20141. (Affirming the judgment of the court below), That the premium having, on the insolvency of the insured, been satisfactorily guaranteed to the company, the policy was thereby kept in full force and effect and did not become void on non-payment of the premium note at maturity. (Strong, J., dissenting.)\n2. That the award was binding on the company, the question as to the payment or default in payment of the premium being a difference \"relating to the insurance\" within the meaning of the policy, and the award not appearing on its face to be bad from any mistake of law or otherwise.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favor of the plaintiff, upon a special case stated for the opinion of the court. The case is hereafter set out in the judgment of Ritchie, C.J. Mr. MacLennan, Q.C., for appellants:\u2014\nThe premium note was not paid when it became due, nor at any time afterwards. It became due on the 30th September, 1878, and the loss occurred on the 12th October following. Under these circumstances the policy became void under the provisions of the first clause of the policy.\nThe judgment proceeds upon a misapprehension of the scope and effect of the clauses of the policy. There are two clauses providing for totally different contingencies; one providing for the case of the premium note being dishonored at maturity, the other for the case of failure in business, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the obligor while the note is current. These clauses are distinct in themselves, and provide for totally distinct contingencies. If the obligor of the note fails in business, &c., then, by virtue of the second clause, the policy is at once suspended, unless and until, before loss, the premium is either paid or secured. It is suspended, but it may be revived by payment or security. If that is done, before loss, the policy is re-established, and goes on as before, as if no failure or bankruptcy, &c., had happened. If the premium is paid both clauses cease to be of any importance, but if the premium is only secured, the other clause remains in full force, and unless the premium is paid at maturity, the policy is to become void.\nIn the present case, when the failure happened a guarantee was given. That had the effect of reviving and re-establishing the policy, and it went on as before. The effect of the failure or bankrutcy was got rid of, and, from the time of giving the guarantee, until the note fell due, the policy was in full force. It was, however, still necessary that the premium note should be paid at maturity, otherwise the policy was to be void under the other clause. There can be no ground for contending that the occurrence of the bankruptcy and the giving of a guarantee dispensed with the payment at maturity, or with the condition avoiding the policy upon default. Every reason is the other way; there are no words in the clauses favoring that view; the guarantee expressly undertakes to see the note paid, and it is only fair that the company should be relieved from further risk on default being made in payment of the premium.\nThe acknowledgment of payment in the policy cannot exclude the condition relied on. The company accepted the note as payment, but there is nothing in that to prevent the parties agreeing that if the note is not paid when due the policy shall be void.\nMr. Rigby, Q.C., for respondent:\nThe award of the arbitrators is conclusive, and the appellants cannot go behind it. Russell on Arbitration[1]; Hodgkinson v. Fernie et al.[2]; Cummings v. Heard[3].\nIn order to entitle the appellants to impeach the award, they should have made the submission a rule of court and moved to set aside the award, and not having done so, the court cannot in this suit review the award, nor entertain any question as to whether the arbitrators decided properly or not in point of law or otherwise. Delver v. Barnes[4].\nThe appellants, by entering into the reference and proceeding with it, recognized the policy as being still in force, and cannot claim that it is invalid. If the policy was void, by reason of non-payment of the premium, or from any other cause, there was nothing to refer. The alleged non-payment of the premium was contested and enquired into before the arbitrators, and their finding thereon was against the appellants, and such finding was conclusive, and is not reviewable in this suit.\nThe guarantee was given to secure the payment of the premium, and was not a guarantee to pay the note at maturity, and such guarantee was equivalent to actual payment of the premium.\nBy the giving of the guarantee in question, the payment of the premium was satisfactorily secured to the appellants, and there is no provision in the policy or in the guarantee making the policy void upon non-payment of this guarantee.\nIt was the duty of the appellants to have demanded payment of the guarantee, especially as it was not a guarantee to pay the note at maturity.\nThe appellants are estopped from asserting that the premium was not paid, inasmuch as the policy, which is under the seal of the defendant company, expressly acknowledges the payment thereof. Arnold on Marine Insurance[5]; Anderson et al. v. Thornton[6]; Roscoe's Nisi Prius[7].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action upon a policy of insurance, issued by defendants to Weir Bros. & Co., with a count upon an award.\nThe said policy was issued on the 27th day of June, A. D. 1878, and was sealed with the common seal of said defendant company, and duly signed by its authorized officers.\nIt was a policy for the sum of $6,000 on the schooner \"Mabel Clare,\" from the port of Liverpool, trading to Labrador and back to Liverpool, with permission to use the Newfoundland coast.\nThe said policy contained, amongst others, the following clauses: The said company hereby acknowledges the receipt of two hundred and ten dollars as the premium or consideration for this insurance, being at and after the rate of three and one-half per cent. and in case the premium, or the note, or other obligations given for the premium, or any part thereof, be not paid when due, this insurance shall be void at and from such default; but the full amount of premium shall be considered as earned, and shall be payable, and the insured shall be entitled to recover for loss or damage which may have occurred before such default. Should the person or any of the persons liable to the company for the premium or on any note or obligations given therefor, or any part thereof, fail in business or become bankrupt or insolvent before the time for payment has arrived, this insurance shall at once become and be void, unless and until before loss the premium be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company.\nIn making payment, the company may deduct any sum remaining unpaid on account of premium, whether the claimant be legally liable to the company therefor or not, and whether the time for payment has or has not arrived, and whether the obligation therefor be or be not outstanding in the hands of persons other than the company, and may also deduct all other indebtedness of the insured or the claimant to the company, but the company shall save harmless, and indemnify the insured against any outstanding obligation for premium to the extent of any deductions made in respect thereof.\nIf any difference shall arise between the company and the insured as to the loss or damage or any other matter relating to the insurance in such case, the insured shall appoint an arbitrator on his or her behalf, and the company shall appoint another; and if the company refuse for fourteen days after notice of the appointment of his arbitrator by the insured to appoint another, the insured may appoint a second, and in either case the two appointed shall forthwith appoint a third, which three arbitrators, or any two of them, shall decide upon the matters in dispute, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the laws of Canada. Provided always, and it is hereby expressly agreed between the company and the insured, that the insured shall not be entitled to maintain any action at law or suit in equity on this policy until the matters in dispute shall have been referred to, and settled by arbitrators, appointed as hereinbefore specified, and then only for such sum as the arbitrators shall award; and the obtaining of the decision of such arbitrators on the matters and claims in dispute is hereby declared to be a condition precedent to the right of the insured to maintain any such action or suit. When insurance was effected a promissory note was given for the premium by the insured.\n[$210.] Halifax, N.S\nThree months after date we promise to pay to the order of the Secretary of the Anchor Marine Insurance Company, of Toronto, at the bank of British North America, at Halifax, the sum of two hundred and ten dollars, value received in Policy No. 142.\n(Signed) Wier Bros. & Co.\nOn the 7th of September, 1873, Wier Bros. & Co. became insolvent, and an attachment was issued against them under the Insolvent Act of 1875.\nOn the 6th of August, 1878, the defendants, in consequence of Wier Bros. & Co.'s failure, demanded and obtained from them, under the terms of the policy, a guarantee as follows:\u2014\nHalifax, 6th August, 1878.\nH. N. Paint, Esq., Secretary Anchor Marine Insurance Company:\nDear Sir: We hereby guarantee you the payment of $210 premium of insurance on schooner \"Mabel Clare,\" under Policy No 143, and for which you hold the note of Wier Bros. & Co.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) Jno. Smith,\nDecember 18th, 1880. William E. Wier,\nGuardians of estate of Jos. Wier.\nThe said note was duly presented and protested for non-payment on the 30th of September, A.D. 1878, the protest thereof being in due form.\nThe said guarantee was never paid, and is now held by the defendant company. It was never returned or offered to the makers, nor was it ever demanded by them, nor did the defendants ever demand payment thereof.\nThe said vessel was wholly lost by perils of the seas insured against by said policy on the 12th day of October, A.D. 1878, and no question is raised as to the sufficiency of the proof of loss or interest, or adjustment. Disputes having arisen, three arbitrators were appointed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy to decide upon and settle the matters in dispute arising out of said policy; these arbitrators made the following award:\nTO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME:\nWe, Harris H. Bligh, of the city and county of Halifax, barrister-at-law; Robert Sedgewick, of the same place, barrister-at-law; and John T. W. Wylde, of the same place, merchant,\nWhereas, in and by a certain policy of insurance, No. 142, bearing date the 27th day of June, in the year of our Lord, 1878, upon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the ship or vessel called the schooner \"Mabel Clare,\" executed by the Anchor Marine Insurance Company in favor of Messrs. Wier Brothers & Co., of Halifax, Nova Scotia, * * * * it was among other things provided and agreed that if any difference should arise between the said insurance company and the insured, as to the loss or damage or any other matter relating to the insurance in such case, three arbitrators should be appointed, which three arbitrators, or any two of them, should decide upon the matters in dispute in accordance with the terms and conditions of said policy and the laws of Canada.\nAnd whereas, we, the undersigned, have been appointed the three arbitrators, in compliance with the terms and conditions of said policy, to decide upon and settle the matters in dispute arising out of said policy,\u2014\nNow know ye that we, the said arbitrators, having taken upon ourselves the burthen of the said arbitration, and having heard, examined and considered the witnesses and evidence brought before us by and on behalf of the said parties in difference, and having fully examined into the claims, under the said policy respectively, do make and publish this our award of and concerning the same in manner following, that is to say:\nWe do award and determine that the loss of said vessel was a total loss, and was bon\u00e0 fide and without fraud. That upon the said policy No. 142 the said F. D. Corbett, as assignee of the said Weir Brothers & Co., under the provisions of the Insolvent Act of 1875, has a just and valid claim and demand against the said The Anchor Marine Insurance Company for the sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty-five dollars and twenty-nine cents, which sum of $5,765.29 is made up in the following manner: Amount insured\n$6,000 00\nDeduct amount received from proceeds\n250 02\n5,749 98\nAdd interest from 14th January, 1879\n237 65\n$5,987 63\nDeduct premium note\n$210 00\nAdd interest from 30th September, 1878\n12 34\n222 34\n$5,765 29\nwhich sum of five thousand seven hundred and sixty-five dollars and twenty-nine cents we do award and determine that the said Tne Anchor Marine Insurance Company do pay to the said F. D. Corbett as such assignee, as aforesaid, which sum shall be so paid, accepted, and taken in full satisfaction and discharge of and upon said Policy No. 142.\n* * * * * * * *\n(Signed) Harris H. Bligh,\nRobert Sedgewick, Arbitrators.\nJohn T. Wylde,\nFees, $120.\nHalifax, September 22nd, 1879.\nThe facts before set forth were proved before the arbitrators on the part of the defendant company, and they are now admitted by the plaintiff to be correct, and to form part of this case, provided the defendant company can avail itself of them as an answer to plaintiff's claim.\nThe question submitted is as follows: \"If upon the foregoing statement of facts the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover on said award or policy, then judgment shall be entered for him for the sum of five thousand seven hundred sixty-five dollars and twenty-nine cents, the amount of said award, with interest at six per cent. from the date of said award, with costs, otherwise judgment is to be entered for the defendant, with costs.\"\nThe first section of the clause, in my opinion, applies simply and solely to the case of a party who, on the falling due of a note given for the premium, fails to pay it at maturity, in which case there is an end of the policy.\nThe second section provides precisely for the present case, viz: When a note or obligation has been given for the premium and the person or any of the persons liable on any such note or obligation \"fail in business or become bankrupt or insolvent before the time of payment has arrived,\" then, and in such a case, the insurance \"shall at once become and be void, unless and until before loss the premium be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company,\" The makers of the promissory note in this case became insolvent before the time of payment had arrived, and the guardians of the estate of the insolvent satisfactorily secured the premium to the company, and so the terms of the policy were complied with\u2014and from that time the company relied on the security so taken for payment of the premium as if no note had been taken, and I can discover no pretence for saying that from the time the premium was so secured to the satisfaction of the company until and at the time of the loss the policy was not in full force and effect. The company still held the guarantee and have never attempted to realize on it, and it does not appear that they could not have done so had they chosen to seek its enforcement, but whether the security was good or bad they elected to accept it.\nAs to the effect of the award, in Forwood v. Watney[8] the contract contained the following arbitration clauses: \"Should any dispute arise, the same to be submitted for settlement to the arbitration of two London corn factors, respectively chosen, whose\nSee particularly Collins v. Locke 4 App. Cases 674; also Moffatt v. Cornelius, 39 L. T. N. S. 102, affirmed, 26 W. R. 914; see also Law v. Garrett, 8 Ch. Div. 26, affirming 57 L. T. N. S. 602; Plews v. Baker, L. R. 16 Eq. 564. Prospective agreements of reference: Dawson v. Lord Otto Fitzgerald, L. R. 9 Exch. 7. decision shall be final and binding.\" Held, that the clause in question formed part of consideration for contract and was intended to include questions of law as well as questions of fact which might arise upon the construction of the contract.\"\nIn Hodgkinson v. Fernie[9] Cockburn, C.J., says:\nIt is not easy to reconcile all the decisions as to how far the court will interfere with the determination of an arbitrator, whether upon the law or upon the facts. But the modern cases which have been cited certainly go the length of deciding, that unless there be something upon the face of the award to show that the arbitrator has proceeded upon grounds which are not sustainable in point of law, the court will not entertain an objection to it. Flaviell v. The Eastern Counties Railway Company[10] is very much to the purpose. The parties have selected their own tribunal, and they are bound by the decision, be it right or wrong.\nWilliams, J.:\nThe law has for many years been settled, and remains so at this day, that, when a cause or matters in difference are referred to an arbitrator, whether lawyer or a layman, he is constituted the sole and final judge of all questions both of law and of fact. You have constituted your own tribunal; you are bound by its decision.\nIn Hart v. Hart[11], Kay, J.:\nIn the case of Milnes v. Gery[12] the agreement was for sale according to the valuation of two persons, one to be chosen by each side, or an umpire appointed by the two in case of disagreement. They differed in their estimate, and were not able to agree upon a third person, and in that case it was decided that the agreement could not be specifically performed. The ground is put thus by Sir William Grant in giving his judgment: \"The only agreement into which the defendant entered was to purchase at a price to be ascertained in a specific mode. No price having ever been fixed in that mode, the parties have not agreed upon any price. Where then is the complete and concluded contract which the court is called upon to execute?\" Surely you may put the reason of that decision briefly thus: The contract which the court is called upon to execute is not a complete contract 5 but it is an agreement that a contract should be made. The court cannot enforce an agreement that a contract should be made; the contract must be complete. Reference is also made to the case of Darbey v. Whitaker[13] which is essentially the same as Milnes v. Gery. Those were the decisions upon which the case of Tillet v. Charing Cross Bridge Co.[14] proceeded. Therefore, I have no doubt, the meaning of that decision was this: that under the particular terms of that contract there was not a complete and concluded agreement, but it was essential in order to complete and conclude the agreement that a further agreement between the company and Messrs. Tillett, or failing them, the arbitration of the named persons should have taken place; and until that was done, there was nothing which the court could enforce, that being the essential term of the agreement. That is entirely consistent with the case of Scott v. Avery in the House of Lords[15]. The facts were these: \"A, effected in a mutual insurance company a policy of insurance on a ship, one of the conditions of which was that the sums to be paid to any insurer for loss should in the first instance be ascertained by the committee, but if a difference should arise between the insurer and the committee relative to the settling of any loss or to a claim for average * * * that was to be referred to arbitration in a way pointed out in the conditions; provided that no insurer who refuses to accept the amount settled by the committee shall be entitled to maintain any action at law or suit in equity on his policy, until the matter has been decided by the arbitrators, and then only for such sum as the arbitrators shall award.\" The obtaining of the decision of the arbitrator was declared to be a condition precedent to the maintaining of an action. It is quite clear, according to the terms of the contract, that as no action could be brought except for such a sum as the insurer was entitled to under the award, until the sum was settled there was no cause of action whatever. That case was followed in Scott v. Corporation of Liverpool[16], where the surveyor was to determine the amount payable, and until he had made that determination there was no sum which could be sued for.\nAll these cases seem to me to proceed on one and the same principle\u2014a very simple and intelligible principle\u2014that where the agreement on the face of it is incomplete until something else has been done, whether by further agreement between the parties, or by the decision of an arbitrator, this court is powerless, because there is no complete agreement to enforce.\nApplying that rule to this case, I find here an agreement which, on the face of it, is quite complete: the arbitrators are not to complete this agreement; they are not to supplement any defect in it; that is not the purpose for which they are appointed; but the thing they are appointed to do is merely this, that in case of difference in working out these terms the matter is to be referred to them.\"\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis was an action upon a policy of marine insurance, and the declaration contained a count on the award hereafter to be mentioned. It came before the court below in the form of a special case stated for its opinion; it being agreed that if the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on the award or policy, then judgment should be entered for him for the sum of $5,765.29, the amount of the award, with interest at 6 per cent from the date of the award, with costs, otherwise judgment was to be entered for the defendant, with costs.\nThe court below was of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and there was a rule to enter judgment accordingly.\nThe policy which was executed by the appellants in favor of Messrs. Wier Bros. & Co., was dated the 27th June, 1878, and was upon the schooner \"Mabel Clare\" for $6,000. The vessel was lost on the 12th of October, 1878, and no question was raised as to the sufficiency of proof of loss or interest. The policy contained (amongst others) the following conditions:\nThat in case the premium or the note or other obligation given for the premium or any part thereof be not paid when due, this insurance shall be void at and from such default. And should the person liable for the premium, or on any note or obligation given therefor, fail in business or become bankrupt or insolvent before the time for payment has arrived, this insurance shall at once become and be void unless and until before loss the premium be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company. There was also in the policy an arbitration clause as follows:\nIf any difference shall arise between the company and the insured as to the loss or damage, or any other matter relating to the insurance, in such case the insured shall appoint an arbitrator on her or his behalf, and the company shall appoint another.\nThen follows a provision for the appointment of a third arbitrator, and the condition proceeds:\nWhich three arbitrators or any two of them shall decide upon the matters in dispute in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the laws of Canada; Provided always, and it is hereby expressly agreed between the company and the insured, that the insured shall not be entitled to maintain any action at law or suit in equity on this policy until the matters in dispute shall have been referred to and settled by arbitrators appointed as hereinbefore specified, and then only for such sum as the arbitrators shall award; and the obtaining the decision of such arbitrators on the matters and claims in dispute is hereby declared to be a condition precedent to the right of the insured to maintain any such action or suit.\nA promissory note was given by Wier Bros. & Co., for the premium, and was current when they failed. A guarantee was then, on 6th August, 1878, given by J. Smith and W. E. Weir, and accepted by the company as a satisfactory security for the premium. This guarantee, addressed to the Secretary of the company, was as follows:\nWe hereby guarantee you the payment of $210 premium of insurance on schooner Mabel Clare and on policy 142, and for which you held the note of Wier Bros. & Co.\nWier Bros. & Co. went into insolvency on 7th September, 1878, and the plaintiff was appointed assignee of their estate. The note became due on 30th September, 1878, and was not paid, but remained overdue and unpaid at the date of the loss on the 12th of October, 1878.\nUpon this state of facts I should have been of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, differing altogether in this respect from the court below, who place their judgment in favour of the plaintiff entirely upon the ground that the conditions were all complied with. The condition to pay or secure the loss in case of failure in business or insolvency was no doubt sufficiently complied with by giving the guarantee to the satisfaction of the company; but there was a clear breach of the other and distinct condition which provided that, in case the premium or the note or other obligation given for it should not be paid when due, the policy should be void from the date of default. Here the guarantee was an obligation given for the premium, as well as the note, and that was according to the undoubted construction of its terms, to pay according to the tenor of the note, i.e., at its maturity. It seems to me therefore impossible to say that there was not at the date of the loss such a default as rendered the policy void. I cannot therefore place my judgment on the same grounds as those on which that of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia proceeded.\nIt appears to me, however, that the plaintiff was clearly entitled to recover on the award which was made in pursuance of the arbitration clause already mentioned, by arbitrators duly appointed according to the terms of that provision. By this award it was determined that the company was liable for the loss in the amount for which the judgment of the court was entered. The case states that the declaration contains a count on this award. No objection was made on any ground to the award, which must be taken to have disposed of all matters which were included in the terms of the arbitration clause already set out. That clause is beyond all question sufficiently comprehensive to include all disputes relative to the payment or securing of the premium according to the terms of the policy. By it arbitration was made a condition precedent to any action being maintained on the policy, or in respect of the insurance.\nWhether the case of Scott v. Avery[17] is to be considered as determining that such a condition precedent is valid as regards all questions, those of liability as well as of amount of damage, or whether it is only binding as to the amount of debt or damage, and is illegal as tending to oust the jurisdiction of the courts when it goes to the root of the action, as was held by Kelly, C.B., and Brett, J., in Edwards v. The Aberayron Mutual Ship Ins. Society[18], is a question which does not arise in the present case. Here no objection has been raised to the arbitration clause, but the parties have mutually acted under it. Therefore, it not being suggested that any fault can be found with the award, and the question as to the payment or default in payment of the premium being \"a difference relating to the insurance\" within the meaning of the policy; and the award not appearing on its face to be bad from any mistake of law or otherwise, we must hold it binding on the company. It, therefore, entirely precludes us from the consideration of the condition relating to the payment of premium and the question of default under it. The appeal must consequently be dismissed with costs,\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nL'Appelante poursuivie sur une police d'assurance maritime \u00e9mise par elle en faveur de Weir Bros. & Co., a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 Corbett, comme syndic \u00e0 la faillite de ces derniers, la somme de $6,399.41. D'apr\u00e8s les conditions de la police la prime pouvait \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e par un billet promissoire, mais \u00e0 la condition que si le billet n'\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance la police devenait nulle. Dans le cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 des assur\u00e9s, avant l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du billet, l'assurance devenait aussi nulle, \u00e0 moins que la prime ne f\u00fbt pay\u00e9e ou garantie d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re condition, (les assur\u00e9s \u00e9tant tomb\u00e9s en faillite), une garantie pour le paiement de la prime fut offerte \u00e0 la Cie. et accept\u00e9e par elle. Le billet ainsi garanti ne fui pas pay\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. L'appelante invoque ce d\u00e9faut de paiement comme \u00e9tant, en vertu des conditions de la police une cause de nullit\u00e9, et demande pour ces motifs l'infirmation du jugement rendu contre elle. Cette pr\u00e9tention n'est pas justifi\u00e9e par les termes de la police. La condition de nullit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie pour deux cas: le premier, d\u00e9faut de paiement du billet de prime \u00e0 son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance; le deuxi\u00e8me, dans le cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 de l'assur\u00e9 avant l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Cette derni\u00e8re cause de nullit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9e en donnant une garantie. Dans le cas actuel une garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e. La police ne contient aucune condition de nullit\u00e9 pour le cas o\u00f9 la garantie n'est pas pay\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. La raison en est sans doute que la Cie. ayant, dans ce cas, le choix entre le paiement et la garantie, si elle accepte cette derni\u00e8re c'est qu'elle la consid\u00e8re comme parfaitement \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 un paiement. De plus il n'appert pas dans la cause que la Cie. ait fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour se faire payer de cette garantie, ni que le paiement en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9. Cette raison suffirait seule pour faire renvoyer l'appel. Mais il y a pour cela une autre raison encore plus concluante: C'est que la Cie. ayant volontairement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 avec l'Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 un arbitrage des mati\u00e8res en contestation concernant cette police, il ne lui est plus permis d'opposer le d\u00e9faut de paiement comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. La sentence rendue par les arbitres est finale et ne peut pas \u00eatre revis\u00e9e dans cette cause. Elle n'aurait pu l'\u00eatre qu'en se conformant aux dispositions de la loi \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, c'est-\u00e0-dire en faisant de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux arbitres une r\u00e8gle de cour et en faisant motion pour la faire annuler pour quelques-unes des causes admises par la loi. Ceci n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, la sentence doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant termin\u00e9 la contestation, et l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\nThis action was brought on a policy of Marine Insurance and upon an award in favor of the respondent. A special case was substituted for the usual pleadings and the evidence adduced before the arbitrators was made evidence herein.\nI am of opinion the respondent is entitled to our judgment on both counts.\nThe only objection to the recovery by the respondent on the first is, that before the note became due the insured became bankrupt, and the note at maturity was protested for non-payment, and that at the time of the loss it still remained unpaid. By one provision of the policy, if the premium or any part thereof should be unpaid when due, the policy was to become void from that time, but that the insured should be entitled to recover if the loss occurred before such default. By another clause of the policy it was provided that if the person or persons liable to the company for the premium, or on any note or obligation therefor, or any part thereof, should become bankrupt or insolvent before the time for payment should arrive, the insurance should become and be void, unless and until before loss the premium should be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company.\nThe policy was issued on the 27th of June, 1878. The note, dated the same day, for the premium ($210) was payable three months after date, and fell due on the 30th September following.\nHaving become bankrupt, Wier Bros & Co., having been called upon for security, obtained, and the company, by their agent, accepted, a guarantee on the 6th of August following. It was addressed to the secretary of the company, and is as follows:\nDear Sir,\u2014We hereby guarantee you the payment of $210, premium of insurance on schooner \"Mable Clare\" under policy No. 142, and for which you hold the note of Wier Bros. & Co.\nThe note was protested for non-payment on the 30th September, and the loss occurred on the 12th of October. We see here two provisions, under the first of which, if not for the other, the policy became void for non-payment of the premium on the 30th of September as to any loss subsequent to that date. Under the second, provision is made against the loss to the company through the bankruptcy of those whose note was taken for the premium, and in that event the policy is to become void \"unless and until before loss the premium be paid or satisfactorily secured to the company.\" There is therefore this important distinction, that under the first provision actual payment is necessary to keep alive the policy, but in the the other, satisfactory security is put on the same footing as payment. In this case, therefore, the policy did not become wholly void, but the security under it suspended until at any time before loss it was satisfactorily secured. I think the true construction of the two clauses, each making provision for different events, are not to be read together, and that by considering the second alone, the giving the security is shown to be equivalent to payment. The policy was binding on the company if the premium were paid before loss, and I think it was equally binding if it were satisfactorily secured as admitted to have been done.\nAfter the loss the whole subject was submitted to three arbitrators, chosen by the parties, and the award made as provided for in the policy. It was not set aside, nor were any steps taken to set it aside. It is not attacked for any reason given or alleged. By the reference, all matters of fact and law were submitted unreservedly to the arbitrators, and unless some good reason to set it aside, such as the refusal of the arbitrators to admit important and legitimate evidence or other improper conduct on their part, no court would interfere with it. The submission was the voluntary act of the parties who, by it, made the arbitrators judges of the law and as a jury to decide on the evidence. The award in this case would be binding on the parties, even if no provision had been made for the submission by the policy, and it is none the less so because the submission is so provided for.\nI think the judgment of the court below is right, and that it should be affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., was also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: J.
