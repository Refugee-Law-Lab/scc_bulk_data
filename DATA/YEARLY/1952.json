The only proof tendered at the trial that the substance was a narcotic drug, consisted of certificates of two analysts. The analysts were not heard as witnesses, although one of them was offered for cross-examination. Counsel for the accused did not at any time object to the admission of the certificates nor to the trial judge's reference to them in his charge as being \"conclusive evidence\" of the substance of the narcotic drug. On appeal, the accused contended that this evidence, although admissible under s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, on a charge under that Act, was not admissible where the charge was one of conspiracy under the Code. Thereupon, the Crown asked for, and obtained, leave under s. 1021 of the Code to call the analysts at the hearing of the appeal; their testimony was heard in the absence of the accused, who declined to attend but who were represented by counsel who cross-examined the witnesses on behalf of the accused. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirmed the convictions.\nBy leave granted by this Court, the accused appealed on two questions of law: (a) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered under ss. 1014 and 1021(1) (b) of the Criminal Code to allow the Crown to produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts, and (b) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered on such evidence, taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the convictions.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed and the convictions affirmed since the Court of Appeal was justified in allowing the taking of further evidence and in affirming the convictions (Kerwin J., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial).\nPer Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ.: The certificates were not admissible in evidence (Desrochers v. The King, 69 C.C.C 322, overruled). (Taschereau J. expressing no opinion on that question, and Fauteux J. contra). Per Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.: In the circumstances of this case, having considered that it was necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to admit further evidence on a non-controversial issue, the Court of Appeal did not infringe any principle of law governing the exercise of the power to hear further evidence given to it by s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code, whose provisions are available to a respondent as well as to an appellant.\nSince there is no restriction as to the effect to be given by the Court of Appeal to the further evidence in disposing of the appeal under s. 1014 of the Code, and since the evidence heard before the Court of Appeal was in its nature conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might influence a jury to come to a different conclusion, the Court of appeal followed the proper course in confirming the convictions.\nPer Fauteux J.: The additional evidence, introduced in appeal, was not essential to legally support the verdict since the certificates were admissible evidence of the facts therein stated, as on a true interpretation of s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act the prosecution in the present case was a prosecution under that Act. (Simcovitch v. The King [1935] S.C.R. 26 and Robinson v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 522 referred to). But in any event, although the failure to object to inadmissible evidence is not always fatal, since the defence manifested a positive intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the facts therein stated or else opted to attempt to preserve a possible ground of appeal, the accused cannot now raise this point; and, as there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting in part) : The Court of Appeal was empowered by s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code to direct that further evidence be taken to support the convictions of the appellants, but it was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken before it and on the evidence at the trial to affirm the convictions because it would thereby be usurping the functions of the jury; it is impossible to say what view the jury might have taken if they had heard the analysts and hence it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred within s. 1014(2) of the Code.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 affirming the appellants' convictions by a jury on charges of conspiracy to sell, etc. narcotic drugs in violation of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.\nHarry Walsh and C. N. Kushner for the appellants. The certificates of analysis were wholly inadmissible in evidence, they were not proof of a drug or drugs within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and the jury should not have been directed that these certificates constituted such proof and that the jury was to take the contents of the said certificates as conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein, since s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, is not applicable to a charge of conspiracy under s. 573 of the Criminal Code. It is clear from the wording of s. 18 of the Act, that the departure from the ordinary rules of evidence requiring oral testimony, is only authorized in a prosecution under that Act. It became therefore vitally necessary for the prosecution to prove the existence of narcotic drugs within the meaning of the Act. When the certificates are eliminated there is no proof anywhere of the existence of a drug. The jury therefore should have been directed that there was a complete lack of proof of the existence of any drug within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeal having come to the conclusion that the jury's verdict was unsupported by proper evidence, and that the certificates had been improperly admitted in evidence, should have allowed the appeal under s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code (Govin v. The King 2 and The King v. Drummond 3).\nFor an interpretation of what is meant by the words \"having regard to the evidence\" in s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code, the case of R. v. Dashwood 4 is referred to.\nThe Court of Appeal had no power to order the examination of the analysts before that Court. S. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code must be interpreted as referring only to the hearing of \"newly-discovered evidence\" or \"new evidence\" and not to evidence that was known and that could have been produced at the trial as was the case here. Furthermore, s. 1021 (1) (b) applies only to evidence that is brought forward on behalf of an appellant in order to set aside the verdict of a jury, but not to the evidence that is tendered by a respondent in order to supply gaps in a case or to support or bolster up a verdict. All the decisions both in England and Canada point up the fact that such evidence will not be received unless it was such that could not have been adduced at the trial and the power to hear fresh evidence is exercised with great caution. S. 1021 was first passed in Canada in 1923 and is practically the same as s. 9 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. A resume of the English decisions indicates that the instances in which evidence is admitted before the Court of Appeal are very limited and that, without exception, so far as can be found, it is always at the instance of the appellant in the case that new evidence is admitted, if at all. (McGrath v. R. 5, Thorne v. R. 6, Hyman Kurasch v. R. 7, Warren v. R. 8, Knox v. R. 9, Hullett v. R. 10, Allaway v. R. 11, William Ward v. R. 12, Mason v. R. 13, Weisz v. R. 14, Starkie v. R. 15, R. v. Mortimer 16, R. v. Hewitt 17, R. v. Dutt 18, R. v. McGerlymchie 19, R. v. Livock 20 and R. v. Robinson 21). It would be usurping the function of the jury altogether, if every time a certain essential bit of evidence was not proved properly and by evidence properly admissible, by the prosecution, it was permitted to the Crown respondent to adduce that evidence before the Court of Appeal in order to have the appeal dismissed.\nA resume of the Canadian decisions also indicates that the application can only be made by an appellant who is seeking to upset the verdict of the jury or trial Court and cannot be invoked by a respondent in order to fill a gap in the evidence presented to the jury. Neither the case of R. v. Feeney 22 nor R. v. Buckle 23 support the course that was adopted by the Court of Appeal in hearing the analysts. The case of Berret v. Sainsbury 24 is useful to show what is done in civil matters where the Court has the same power as given by s. 1021.\nEven if the Court of Appeal did have the power to hear the evidence of the analysts, such evidence could only be used for the purpose of determining whether there should be a new trial or an acquittal, and could not be used for the purpose of taking same in conjunction with the evidence given at the trial, and then used to dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal should have allowed the appeal since there was no proof adduced of any drugs within the meaning of the Act, and then either quash the convictions or direct a new trial (R. v. Drummond 25). S. 1014(2) of the Code cannot effect the result of a dismissal of the appeal, since the onus is on the respondent to show that the balance of the evidence, apart from the impugned certificates, would certainly or inevitably result in a conviction of the appellants. Without the certificates there cannot have been any possibility of conviction of any of the appellants since there was then no proof of the existence of any drugs within the meaning of the Act. (Northey v. The King 26).\nA. M. Shinbane, K.C., for the respondent. The certificates were admissible in evidence (Jacobs v. R. 27 and Desrochers v. The King 28.\nThe Court of Appeal was empowered to allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts. S. 1021(1) (b) of the Code gives it that power. This section corresponds substantially to s. 9 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. But the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to direct a new trial and this limitation of power in some measure at least accounts for the reluctance of that Court to allow evidence to be called which might have been heard at the trial. (R. v. Mason 29). Almost all the reported cases deal with \"fresh\" or \"new\" evidence. Here the evidence was merely supplementary and confirmatory. Inasmuch as the form in which their evidence was tendered was to be considered faulty, the analysts were called merely to confirm the accuracy of their analyses, the introduction of which as evidence and the reference thereto were not at any time objected to by the defence at any stage of the trial. But under s. 1021, the evidence may be of a character other than \"new\" or \"fresh\".\nAlthough the omission by the defence to object does not prevent the defence from raising the objection in the Court of Appeal, nevertheless that omission was a circumstance properly to be considered by the Court. It indicated that the defence either shared in the mistake of the prosecution and the Court, or believed that the accused was not substantially prejudiced by the erroneous form in which the proof of drugs was put before the jury. More so in this case when the notice of appeal arguing that the certificates were not admissible was filed the day after the verdict was rendered and on the same day that sentence was passed. (R. v. Stirland 30 and R. v. Cutter 31).\nThe power and the practice of the Court of Appeal in respect of fresh or new evidence not tendered at the trial may be summarized thus: (a) The Court has power to admit it; (b) It is a power which must always be exercised with great care; (c) The Court will not lay down any definition of what will constitute exceptional or special circumstances; (d) The Court will allow evidence to be given which might have been given at the trial, if it is satisfied that the omission was due to a misunderstanding, inadvertence or mistake. (R. v. Robinson 32, R. v. Weisz 33, R. v. Hullett 34, R. v. Warren 35, R. v. Knox 36 and R. v. Collins 37.\nFurthermore, that section is a remedial provision and there is no ambiguity in its language. (R. v. Robinson et al 38 and R. v. McTemple 39.\nThe Court of Appeal was empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to confirm the convictions, as there was then such overwhelming evidence of guilt that no reasonable jury on a proper direction could or would have failed to convict the appellants, and there was therefore no miscarriage of justice. The converse of the principle in R. v. Gach 40 is applicable to the present case, and the Court of Appeal was authorized to dismiss the appeal by ss. 1014, 1021 of the Code, and by the provisions of the Court of Appeal Act of Manitoba. Because fresh evidence or further or additional evidence is admitted on appeal, it does not follow that the case must be sent back for a new trial (R. v. Feeney 41 and R. v. Buckle 42.\nThe accused had a trial by jury, because, apart from anything else, there was ample evidence to support the verdict as found out by the Court of Appeal, and therefore there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Kerwin J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The four appellants were found by a jury to be guilty on three counts of an indictment charging conspiracies to commit indictable offences, i.e., to unlawfully sell drugs, to unlawfully possess drugs, and to unlawfully cause drugs to be taken or carried from one place to another in Canada\u2014all within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as amended, without first having obtained a licence. Convictions were entered and sentences imposed. From these convictions they appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (1) and during the hearing of their appeals the Crown applied to be allowed to produce before the Court of Appeal, in support of the convictions, the evidence of two analysts who had certified that certain material sold, possessed, or taken or carried, was a narcotic drug within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The certificates had been put in evidence as if the prosecutions had been under that Act instead, as was the fact, for conspiracies under section 573 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the sale, possession, taking or carrying was given as part of the evidence upon which the charges of conspiracy were based.\nThe Court of Appeal 43 granted the Crown's application and the evidence of the analysts was taken. Upon that evidence and the evidence at the trial, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the accused. By leave granted under subsection 1 of section 1025 of the Code as enacted by section 42 of chapter 39 of the 1948 Statutes, the accused appeal to this Court on the following questions of law:\n(1) On the appellants' appeal from their conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 and 1021 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code or otherwise to allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?\n(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or was it authorized merely to order a new trial? As to the first point, section 1021 (1) (b) of the Code is in the following terms:\n1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of justice\n. . .\n(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; and\nexercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal.\nIt is contended that by the words \"For the purposes of an appeal under this Part\", Parliament never intended to give the Crown, on an accused's appeal, the right to ask, or to give the Court the right to permit, that evidence be heard in support of the conviction of the appellant, particularly when the trial had been with a jury. Emphasis is placed upon section 1014 of the Code which provides that on the hearing of an appeal against conviction the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion\n(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence; or\n(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law;\nIt is said that the convictions cannot be supported on the evidence because without the certificates there was no evidence that the material in question was a drug within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Testimony was given at the trial by which, the Crown contends, the jury would have been entitled to find that it was such a drug. The Court of Appeal evidently felt that proposition to be doubtful because, if it were sound, there would have been no occasion to order the taking of the evidence of the analysts. Presuming in the meantime that this is so, the question is squarely raised as to the power of the Court of Appeal to make the order. We are told that no Canadian case can be found where evidence was taken before the Court of Appeal to support a conviction. Reliance is placed upon the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Drummond 44, where it was held that on a charge of perjury committed at the trial of an indictment, such trial and the indictment, verdict and judgment therein must be proved as matters of record and this not having been done, the conviction was set aside. It is to be noted that that part of section 1021 quoted above was first enacted by section 9 of chapter 41 of the Statutes of 1923, so that at the time of the Drummond decision there was no power in the Court of Appeal to receive further evidence. In another case, which was not referred to, Rex v. Ivall 45, the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on a charge that the accused removed a child under the age of fourteen years from the custody of the Children's Aid Society where, on the first trial, the child's age had not been proved. No application was made for leave to produce the evidence before the Court of Appeal.\nThe 1923 Act was taken from the Criminal Appeal Act of England, 1907, and no decisions have been found in England in which the Crown was given leave to do as was done here. In Rex v. Robinson 46, an application was made by the Crown to introduce evidence that arose after the conviction and therefore could not have been called at the trial, but this was on the basis that such evidence would have a material bearing on the accused's application for leave to appeal from a conviction in view of the fact that one of the grounds stated in the application for leave was that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and in those circumstances one question that would have to be considered was whether there had been any substantial miscarriage of justice. The evidence admitted was a letter written by the accused in which he admitted the act which it was alleged constituted murder.\nThe case does show that further evidence will be admitted although there it was of something that occurred after the trial. However, the ground of the decision was the provision in the Criminal Appeal Act that the Court of Criminal Appeal may exercise in relation to the proceedings in the Court any other powers which might for the time being be exercised by the Court of Appeal in appeals on civil matters. Considering the similar provisions of section 1021, it appears to me that they are sufficient to empower the Court of Appeal to direct that further evidence be taken.\nOn the argument, the attention of counsel was directed to the decision of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec in Desrochers v. The King 47. That decision was not referred to before the Manitoba Court of Appeal 48 or on the application for leave to appeal to this Court. There, the accused were charged under section 573 of the Criminal Code with having conspired to commit an indictable offence under The Excise Act, 1934 By section 113 of that Act: \"In every prosecution under this Act, the certificate of analysis \u2026 shall be accepted as prima facie evidence\"; and in the French version: Dans toute poursuite en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi, le certificat d'analyse \u2026 est accept\u00e9 comme prima facie. It was held that a certificate was admissible by virtue of that section in the prosecution of the charge of conspiracy under the Code.\nSection 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, enacts: \"In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the analysis of any drug or drugs \u2026 shall be prima facie evidence.\" The French version reads: \"Dans toute poursuite institu\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi, un certificat relatif \u00e0 l'analyse d'une drogue ou de drogues, \u2026 constitue une preuve prima facie\". For present purposes, this section, in either version, may be taken to bear the same meaning as section 113 of The Excise Act, 1934, in either version. The present proceeding not being a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, section 18 thereof is inapplicable and the decision in Desrochers on that point should be overruled.\nSection 28 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 1, reads as follows:\n28. Every Act shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an indictable offence; (b) punishable on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence ; and all provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nThat section was considered by this Court in Simcovitch v. The King 49 in conjunction with section 69 of the Criminal Code by which anyone is a party to and guilty of an offence who \"(d) counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.\" It was held that one who counselled a bankrupt to commit an offence specified in section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act was by the combined operation of section 28 of the Interpretation Act and section 69 of the Code guilty of an offence under section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act although that section, by its terms, referred only to a person having been a bankrupt or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who had made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act. That decision can have no application here because, within the terms of section 28 of the Interpretation Act, there is no provision of the Criminal Code which it is suggested might be made applicable. On the contrary, the suggestion is that on a prosecution under the Code a certificate of analysis is to be taken as prima facie evidence merely because section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act states that in any prosecution under that Act a certificate is to be so treated. With respect I can find no justification for reading the enactment in that manner.\nIt was argued that there was sufficient evidence without the certificates but it must be borne in mind that having admitted them, the trial judge instructed the jury that they were conclusive. I am not now dealing with a situation where, on a charge of conspiring to commit an indictable offence under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the evidence of such conspiracy is based upon something other than the actual commission of an offence itself. What is relied upon in the present case to prove the conspiracy are specific acts, and the circumstances that witnesses testified at the trial that the article dealt with was heroin and that the accused, or some of them, so designated it to those witnesses, are not sufficient. If articles be sold which were mere substitutes for a narcotic and not within the class of specified drugs, there would be no offence. On the other hand, the gist of an offence under section 573 of the Code is the conspiracy itself, and in a proper case a jury might find that a conspiracy existed to sell a specified narcotic without first having obtained a licence.\nIn my opinion the second question raises a question of law and the Court of Appeal was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken before it and on the evidence at the trial to affirm the conviction because it would thereby usurp the functions of the jury. It is not a matter of interfering with a discretion exercised by the Court of Appeal since it is impossible to say what view a jury might take if they had the analysts before them and hence it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred within section 1014(2) of the Code.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The appellants were jointly charged on four counts of conspiracy to violate the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, and were found guilty on three.\nAt trial, the respondent filed certificates of analysis to establish that the drugs which were possessed and sold by the appellants, were heroine, a drug within the meaning of the Act, but the analysts themselves were not heard. Section 18 of the Act is to the effect that \"in any prosecution under the Act\", such certificates signed by a Dominion analyst, constitute prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.\nBefore the Court of Appeal 50, the appellants submitted that, not having been prosecuted under the Act, but for conspiracy under the Criminal Code, the certificates were illegal evidence, and that the analysts should have been called. The Court of Appeal 51 obviously agreed with this contention, for at the request of the respondent, it received the evidence of the analysts and unanimously confirmed the conviction. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by Mr. Justice Kerwin on the two following questions of law:\n(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section 1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given? (2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or was it authorized merely to order a new trial?\nIf a prosecution for conspiracy to possess and sell heroine, is a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the conviction was valid, and the Court of Appeal did not need to hear new evidence; but in view of the conclusion which I have reached, I do not think it necessary to determine this question.\nSection 1021 (b) of the Criminal Code is as follows:\n1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of justice.\n(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal;\nAs to the power of the Court of Appeal to hear fresh evidence, I have no doubt, if any meaning is to be given to section 1021(b), which states that \"for the purposes of the appeal\", witnesses may be examined before the court. It is obviously in order to enable the court to properly determine the case, that such a power is conferred, and these plain words used by the legislator must be given effect to. Otherwise, the section would be nugatory, and Parliament's expressed intentions would be defeated.\nThis section corresponds substantially to section 9(b) of the English Criminal Appeal Act 1907. It has been held in England that this authority to hear new evidence must be used with \"great care\" and in \"exceptional circumstances\" only, and I think that the rule here is the same. (Rex v. Mason) 52 ; (Rex v. Rowland) 53. A too liberal exercise of this power would undoubtedly conflict with the economy of our criminal law, would in certain instances give the Crown a second chance to make a case which it has failed to make at trial, and could possibly also invest a court of appeal with powers exclusively within the province of the jury. But in the case at bar, in view of the special circumstances, I think that the Court of Appeal was right in granting the application made by the Crown to hear the analysts. The accuracy of the facts contained in the certificates were not an issue before the jury, and all parties seemed to agree that the drug had been properly proved. Although the failure of counsel for the defence to object to illegal evidence, cannot as a rule be considered as fatal, it is important to note in the present case, that he declined to cross-examine one of the analysts who was present at the trial, and offered by the Crown. The Court of Appeal merely corrected an error upon which the jury acted, and as Dysart J. said, it has put the case in exactly the position in which the jury believed it to be, when they convicted the accused.\nUnder section 1014, Cr. Code, the Court of Appeal could confirm or order a new trial, and I think that it followed the proper course in adopting the former. The fresh evidence was in its nature conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might influence a jury in coming to a conclusion.\nI would dismiss the appeals.\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellants, whose conviction for conspiracy contrary to s. 573 of the Criminal Code was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 54, have, by way of a further appeal, been granted leave, under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code as amended in 1948 (S. of C. 1948, c. 39, s. 42), to submit two questions of law to this Court:\n\"(1) On the Appellants' appeal from their conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 and 1021 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code or otherwise to allow the Respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?\n(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or was it authorized merely to order a new trial?\"\nThese appellants were charged upon four counts of conspiracy to unlawfully (a) sell, (b) possess, (c) cause to be taken and (d) distribute, drugs within the meaning of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and thereby to have committed an offence contrary to the provisions of s. 573 of the Criminal Code. At their trial before a judge and jury they were found guilty of (a), (b) and (c).\nThe Crown established the conspiracy by adducing evidence of specific instances of selling, possessing and causing to be taken, drugs contrary to The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. As proof of the fact that the commodity dealt with in each instance was a narcotic drug, ten certificates of analysis were placed in evidence without objection. Counsel for the Crown, in tendering these certificates, was under the impression that they were admissible by virtue of the provisions of s. 18 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. This impression was concurred in by the learned trial judge. S. 18 reads as follows:\n18. In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a Dominion or provincial analyst shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of the person giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or signature.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal held that the provisions of s. 18 had no application to a trial for conspiracy under s. 573 of the Criminal Code and that the ten certificates prepared by the analysts were improperly received. The learned judges, however, were of the opinion that this was an appropriate case in which to hear viva voce evidence of the analysts under the authority of s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code:\n1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of justice.\n. . .\n(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; \u2026\nand exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal. Messrs. Jones and Blanchard, who had prepared these certificates, were accordingly called as witnesses before the Court of Appeal and there gave evidence to the same effect as set out in their respective certificates.\nS. 1021 (1) (b) was enacted by Parliament in 1923 and is to the same effect as s. 9(b) of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act in Great Britain (1907, 7 Edw. VII, c. 23). In the Court of Criminal Appeal the corresponding English s. 9(b) was commented upon as follows:\nUndoubtedly the Legislature has armed this Court with the widest possible powers for the purposes of investigation, and in a proper case this Court would not refuse to make use of the powers which are contained in these paragraphs of s. 9.\nRex v. Thorne 55.\nParliament has indicated what is \"a proper case\" by expressly providing that the wide powers under s. 1021 (1) (b) shall be exercised only where the court of appeal \"thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of justice.\" Under this provision it has been repeatedly held, as stated by the learned author of Archibald's Cr. Pl., Ev. & P., 32nd Ed., p. 309, that\nThe Court will only act upon this power in very special circumstances.\nwhich, as pointed out by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Weisz 56, \"they had been careful not to define.\" A similar view is expressed in Rex v. MacTemple 57. It, therefore, appears that if a court of appeal has concluded that the circumstances are exceptional and directed the reception of the evidence its decision should not be disturbed, unless, in arriving at its conclusion, it has acted contrary to principle.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal deemed the circumstances here sufficiently special that, in the interest of justice, the evidence of the analysts should be heard. It is an unusual case. Apart from a statutory provision, such evidence as we are here concerned with can only be received viva voce. S. 18 is enacted as part of, and is applicable only \"in any prosecution under,\" The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Such a provision has no application to a prosecution for an offence under s. 573 of the Criminal Code. In so far as Desrochers v. The King 58, may be contrary to this view, it must be overruled. S. 28 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1), which makes certain provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to other statutes, does not make the provisions of those other statutes applicable to prosecutions under the Criminal Code and, therefore, does not assist the prosecution upon this appeal.\nWe were informed that these certificates were placed in evidence at the preliminary without objection. Then, when counsel for the Crown, prior to the trial, decided that it was unnecessary for him to call all the witnesses who could depose to the relevant facts, he prepared a list of these, together with a summary of their evidence, and submitted it to counsel for the appellant, with a request that if he desired any of these witnesses to be called for the purpose of cross-examination that he so advise him. This list included Jones, one of the analysts, who had prepared some of these certificates. Counsel for the appellant replied that he desired that only one Porter, whose evidence was not upon any question relative to the analysis of the commodities, be alone produced for cross-examination. All of this was explained before the presiding judge and appears in the record of the trial, in part, as follows:\nTHE COURT: Your answer is, you don't wish him to call any except Porter?\nMr. KUSHNER: I don't wish any witness called for the purpose of cross-examination, other than Inspector Porter.\nThe failure of counsel for the defence to object to the reception of inadmissible evidence does not, in general, constitute a bar to the objection thereto in an appellate court, nor would it alone justify a court of appeal in exercising its powers under s. 1021 (1) (b). It is, however, an important circumstance in this case because it corroborates what was evidenced throughout the trial that the main contentions of the defence were not directed to whether the substances were narcotic drugs within the meaning of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. In Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions 59, Viscount Simon stated:\n\u2026 the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced. Even if the certificates had been admissible under s. 18, they were only prima facie evidence of their contents and if counsel for the appellant had intended to raise any question as to their correctness or the weight of the statements contained therein he would have, upon receipt of the request from counsel for the Crown, asked that at least Jones be called for cross-examination.\nThe certificates, though inadmissible, were received at and accepted throughout the trial as evidence of the facts therein set out. The Court of Appeal, under s. 1021 (1) (b), permitted these facts to be placed in evidence by the calling of the witnesses Jones and Blanchard, who had made the analyses and prepared the certificates and who deposed to the same facts as set out in the certificates. In effect, the same facts are now repeated in the record, but in a form admissible in law. Under these circumstances the Court of Appeal, in concluding, in the interests of justice, that the additional evidence should be received, has violated no principle and has acted within its power under s. 1021 (1)\nThe contention of counsel for the appellant that the Court of Appeal had no power to receive the evidence of Jones and Blanchard, because in neither case was the evidence \"newly discovered\" or \"new evidence\" unknown to the Crown at the time of the trial, is not tenable. In support of his contention he cited a statement of Lord Chief Justice Goddard in Rex v. McGrath 60, which had reference to the disposition of the case when previously before the court and was not essential to the decision of the case which was now before the court upon a reference by the Secretary of State under s. 19(a), where, as pointed out in Rex v. Collins 61, different considerations obtain. Moreover, counsel, in his submission, would construe s. 1021 (1) (b) as equivalent to the rule in civil cases for the granting of a new trial and the reception of further evidence. The language of s. 1021 (1) (b) does not support this submission. The incorporation of the reference to \"appeals in civil matters\" follows and is in addition, or supplementary, to the powers set out in subpara. (b) of 1021(1). Moreover, neither in England nor in Canada has this provision been so construed. Rex v. Dutt 62; Rex v. Warren 63 ; Rex v. Hullett 64 ; Rex v. Allaway 65; Rex v. Ward 66; Rex v. Mason 67; Rex v. Knox 68 ; Rex v. MacTemple 69 ; Rex v. Buckle 70.\nThe further submission of counsel for the appellant, that the provisions of s. 1021 (1) (b) are applicable only in support of an appellant who seeks to set aside a verdict of guilty, is not tenable. The comprehensive language of the section is such as to make it applicable to both the defence and the Crown and had Parliament intended any such limitation as here suggested it would have adopted apt language to give expression thereto. Moreover, in Rex v. Robinson 71, where the accused appealed, the Crown was granted leave to call further evidence. The facts of the case are quite different, but it does support the view that the provisions of the section are available to the Crown as well as the defence. The section, as already stated, gives wide powers to a court of appeal, to be exercised only where that court properly concludes that the evidence should be received in the interest of justice.\nThe second question assumes the power of the court of appeal to hear the evidence, but suggests that, having done so, it is authorized merely to order a new trial. There does not appear to be, nor was our attention directed to, any provision in s. 1021 (1) (b), or elsewhere, to the effect that the reception of evidence under that section by a court of appeal limits or restricts that court in its disposition of the appeal under s. 1014. On the contrary, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code rather contemplate that the evidence so received shall form a part of the record and be considered along with the evidence taken at the trial. If the court of appeal finds that there are reasons within s. 1014(1) (a), (b) and (c) to allow the appeal, it will do so, but, if not, then under s. 1014(1) (d) it will dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that this case did not come under s. 1014(1) (a), (b) or (c), but under s. 1014(1) (d), and, therefore, dismissed the appeal. Dysart J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court, stated:\nIn the present case the fresh evidence is as nearly conclusive as oral testimony can be. It is directed to only one point\u2014the scientific analysis of the material which the prosecution charges was a narcotic drug; and it proves beyond any doubt that the material was a narcotic within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The evidence is of highly competent analysts; it has no internal weakness or defect, and is not contradicted nor challenged by any other evidence in the case.\nThis evidence was to precisely the same effect as the facts set forth in the certificates. In cross-examination the witnesses were asked as to the possibility of mistake or error, but their answers were such that this contention was not pressed. What was attained by the calling of these witnesses was the placing in the record, in a form admissible as evidence, facts which erroneously had been treated as properly before the court at the trial. As such, they were passed upon by the jury. In effect, it was, therefore, a change in form rather than substance upon an issue in respect of which contentions were not raised at the trial. No reason is suggested why a jury, acting judicially, would not have come to the same conclusion.\nIn my opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nLocke J.:\u2014The charge against the appellants in respect to the offence of conspiring to sell narcotic drugs was:\nThat they, the said John Kissick, Peter Kissick, William Kissick and Stella (Sally) Smallwood \u2026 conspired with each other and with other persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit: to unlawfully sell drugs, within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and amendments thereto, without first having obtained a licence from the Minister of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority.\nThe charges as to the offences of possessing, carrying and distributing narcotic drugs were expressed in similar terms.\nThe offences created by section 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act 1929 are indictable. Section 573 of the Criminal Code provides that:\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for, conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence. and it was under this section of the Code that these proceedings were taken.\nSection 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act provides that:\nIn any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a Dominion or provincial analyst shall be prim facie evidence of the facts stated in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of the person giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or signature.\nOn the assumption that this section might be invoked in a prosecution for conspiracy, ten certificates, certain of which were signed by J. B. Jones and others by J. F. Blanchard, both Dominion analysts, were tendered and received in evidence at the trial as proof of the fact that the drugs said to have been sold by certain of the appellants were substances mentioned in the schedule to the Act. Neither of the analysts gave oral evidence. In advance of the hearing, however, counsel for the Crown had advised counsel for the accused that there were eleven witnesses whose evidence would be merely corroborative, these including the name of the analyst Jones, whom the Crown did not propose to call, unless the defence wished any of them to be called for the purpose of cross-examination, and was advised that they did not wish Jones and others to be called for this purpose. The name of Blanchard was not included in the list. In charging the jury Mr. Justice Montague instructed them that they were to give full credence to the certificates and that the facts stated in them were to be taken as \"proven conclusively\" and no objection was made by counsel for any of the prisoners to this or any other portion of the charge. The learned trial judge directed the jury to acquit the appellants of the fourth of the charges, namely, that of conspiring to distribute narcotic drugs, and of the three other charges they were all found guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.\nThe present appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 72, serving their notice on the day they were sentenced and raising amongst other grounds the contention that the certificates were inadmissible, since the prosecution was not under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. During the hearing of the appeal counsel for the Crown applied for leave to adduce oral evidence in support of the conviction and orders were made that the evidence of the analyst Jones be taken before the Court of Appeal, and that of the analyst Blanchard, who was ill at the time, before Mr. Justice Adamson. The accused disclaimed any wish to be present during these proceedings but they were represented by counsel who cross-examined the witnesses on their behalf. In the result the convictions were affirmed and the appeals dismissed.\nThe present appeal has been taken pursuant to special leave granted by Kerwin J. and by whose order the questions of law to be determined are thus stated:\n\"1. On the appellants' appeal from their conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 and 1021(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, or otherwise, to allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?\n2. If so, was that Court empowered on such evidence, taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or was it authorized merely to order a new trial?\"\nSection 1013 of the Criminal Code grants a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal to a person convicted on indictment in certain defined circumstances, and subsection 4 of that section, introduced into the Act in 1930, allows an appeal by the Crown from a verdict of acqittal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone. The powers of the Court for disposing of such appeals are defined by section 1014. Section 1021 provides in part as follows:\nFor the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice,\n. . .\n(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal;\nand exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court of appeal on appeals in civil matters, \u2026 By the Court of Appeal Act, c. 40, R.S.M. 1940, section 27, it is provided that the court upon any appeal, may give any judgment which ought to have been pronounced and make such further or other order as is deemed just, and by subsection 3 that:\nthe Court shall have full discretionary power to receive further evidence upon questions of fact by oral examination in court, by affidavit, or by declaration taken before an examiner or a commissioner.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that the certificates of the analysts were not admissible in evidence and the application made on behalf of the Crown would indicate that this position was accepted by counsel on its behalf. On the argument before us, however, counsel for the Crown contended that section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, applied to a prosecution such as this and that accordingly the facts disclosed in the certificates of analysis were proven. If this contention could be sustained, it would, of course, be unnecessary to deal with either of the questions submitted. In my opinion, the certificates were not admissible and the fact that the substances dealt in by the appellants were narcotic drugs, within the meaning of the Act, was not proven. The offence for which the accused were indicted was not that of committing any of the offences enumerated in the Act of which section 18 forms a part, but rather the offence of conspiring with others to commit such an offence, a conspiracy declared to be indictable by section 573 of the Criminal Code. The opening words of section 18 are \"in any prosecution under this Act\" and there could be no prosecution under that Act for acts declared to be an offence by a section of the Criminal Code and not elsewhere in any statute relating to the criminal law. To invoke section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act in a prosecution such as this would be to import a section of that Act into the Criminal Code, and for this I find no warrant anywhere.\nIn ordering the taking of further evidence the Court of Appeal has acted in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by section 1021 and the determination of the first question requires us to decide whether, in so doing, it has acted upon the proper principle (Brown v. Dean) 73. The relevant portions of section 1021, while not verbatim, are indistinguishable from the corresponding portions of section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 of England. There it may be noted the court is not empowered to order a new trial. In Rex v. Mason 74 17 C.A.R. 161, Darling J., in delivering the judgment of the court on an application to adduce further evidence, said in part:\nIt is now really asked that there should be a new trial, which this Court is not empowered to order, and that we should hear certain witnesses whose names have been mentioned, and then consider the whole of the trial in the light of that new evidence. This Court exercises with very great caution the power given it to hear fresh evidence because to do so is opposed to the old established, trusted and cherished institution of trial by jury. This Court has to be convinced of very exceptional circumstances before it will reconsider the verdict of a jury in the light of fresh evidence which has not been laid before the jury, and which, in some cases, might have been put before the jury at the trial.\nAs to the evidence of proposed witnesses who were available but not called at the trial, to the same effect is the judgment of that court in Rex v. Hatch 75. In some cases such as Rex v. Warren 76, where the witness was not called at the trial, due to a misunderstanding, evidence has been received in the Court of Appeal but where, as in Rex v. Weisz 77, on the appeal of the prisoner an application was made to give the evidence of a woman who had been absent from England at the time of the trial, Reading C.J., in refusing the application, said that the appellant's legal advisers knew the case they would have to meet and no application was made to adjourn the trial, that there was no surprise and that the policy was deliberate of resting the defence upon the available evidence. These were all cases where the appellant was the prisoner but in Rex v. Robinson 78, where a prisoner applied for leave to appeal, the Crown asked leave to put in further evidence, being a letter written by the prisoner since his conviction in which he admitted committing the offence, and this was permitted under the provisions of section 9 of the Act.\nIn Rex v. Collins 79, further evidence was received on the appeal because the reference had been made to the court by the Home Secretary who wanted the court to deal with it, but Goddard L.C.J. pointed out the risk of allowing such evidence after conviction and the reason why it is not done, save in exceptional circumstances, in these terms:\nThe danger of allowing further evidence to be called after conviction, and the reason why the Court does not allow it save in exceptional circumstances, is clear enough. It is very easy after a person has been convicted to find witnesses who are willing to come forward and say this, that, or the other thing. If further evidence were allowed in such circumstances, it could always be said: \"If this evidence had been given at the trial, it does not follow that the jury would have convicted, or they might not have convicted.\" That is especially true in cases where the defence is an alibi. Two or three witnesses perhaps are called to establish an alibi, which the jury reject. It is very often not difficult after conviction to find another witness or perhaps two more witnesses who would be willing to come and support the alibi, and it can always be said: \"If only the prisoner had had the evidence of A or B which is now tendered, the jury might have come to a different decision, and the prisoner should have the benefit of that possibility.\" That is one of the reasons why this Court is necessarily reluctant to allow further evidence to be called after conviction.\nSome further light on the construction which has been placed upon the English Statute by the court is afforded by the judgment in Rex v. Rowland 80, where, on an appeal against a conviction on a charge of murder, an application was made on behalf of the appellant for leave to call as a witness a man who, since the trial of the appellant, confessed that he himself had committed the murder of which the appellant had been convicted. Humphreys J., delivering the judgment of the court, after pointing out that to permit this would involve an inquiry of a totally different character from the simple issue involved in the calling of a fresh witness to speak to some fact connected with the defence put forward at the trial and in effect engage the court in trying not only the accused but also the man who wished to confess to committing the crime, said in part (p. 462):\nNow the court has in truth no power to try anyone upon any charge. It is not a tribunal of fact but a court of appeal constituted by statute to examine into the proceedings of inferior courts in certain cases of conviction or indictment. We have no power even to direct a new trial by a jury; much less have we the right to conduct one ourselves.\nThese general statements of the principles to be followed in hearing such appeals in England, while indicating generally the reluctance of the court to hear further evidence except under exceptional circumstances, do not touch the exact point to be determined here where there was, in my opinion, no sufficient evidence of a matter essential to the validity of the convictions, and counsel for the Crown seeks to remedy the defect on the prisoners' appeal to the Court of Appeal. If the application had been to give further evidence on the ground that its existence had been discovered since the trial and the issue upon which the evidence was tendered was controversial, the principles stated in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Hosking v. Terry 81 and in the judgment of this Court in Varette v. Sainsbury 82, would apply. In the view I take of the matter, however, these principles are inapplicable in the circumstances of the present case.\nSection 1021 does not restrict the power of the Court of Appeal to permit further evidence to be given before it to cases where the applicant is the appellant, but permits its admission also at the instance of the respondent if, in the circumstances of the case, it is considered that to do so is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice. If the evidence sought to be introduced on the hearing of the appeal touch upon an issue which is controversial, involving a consideration of the weight to be given to the evidence, the court of appeal would be involved, as pointed out by Humphreys J. in Rowland's case, in conducting a trial, and to do this, in my opinion, is outside of anything contemplated by section 1021.\nThe reasons for judgment delivered on the application to take the further evidence direct attention to the fact that, while all of the accused were represented by counsel, no objection was made to the admission of the certificates at the time they were offered in evidence, nor was the objection raised on the argument of the motion made on behalf of the accused at the conclusion of the Crown's case for a directed verdict of not guilty, nor after the judge's charge in which he had instructed the jury that the certificates were to be accepted as proof of the facts stated in them. From the fact that the appellants were found guilty on October 25, 1950, and were sentenced on the following morning, and that the notices of appeal were given on the same day raising the objection to the admissibility of the certificates, an inference might be drawn that the failure to object at the trial was deliberate. In Rex v. Sanders 83, where copies of letters were introduced into the evidence by the Crown without objection and where the prisoners were represented by counsel, Bray J. said that the objection ought to have been taken at the time and, as it was not then taken, it could not be entertained by the court. That this statement cannot be taken without qualification appears from the judgment in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions 84, where Viscount Simon, L.C. said in part:\nNo doubt, as was said in the same case (Rex v. Ellis (1910) 2 K.B. 746,764), the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced. It is not a proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the time in order to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal, but where, as here, the reception or rejection of a question involves a principle of exceptional public importance, it would be unfortunate if the failure of counsel to object at the trial should lead to a possible miscarriage of justice.\nIt is not the law, in my opinion, that the failure of counsel for a prisoner to object to the admission of evidence is in all circumstances fatal to an appeal taken on the ground that the evidence has been improperly admitted. If it be assumed that in these circumstances the objection may still properly be raised, the course adopted by counsel on behalf of the appellants has made manifest that they did not consider the fact that the drugs were of the nature referred to in the schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act was open to dispute and did not intend to tender evidence to dispute it. The accuracy of the evidence given in the Court of Appeal was not open to question and where it is clear that there had been no intention on the part of the accused persons to dispute the facts shown, I am unable to perceive any principle of law governing the exercise of the discretion vested in the court which has been infringed by receiving it. In my opinion, the answer to the first question should be in the affirmative.\nSection 1021 permits the taking of further evidence \"for the purposes of an appeal under this part.\" I see no ambiguity in this language nor anything in the section or elsewhere in the sections relating to criminal appeals restricting, or indicating any intention of restricting the effect to be given by the court to the further evidence in exercising its powers under section 1014. I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Dysart that the evidence given before the Court of Appeal in this matter is as nearly conclusive as oral testimony can be and that it was within the powers of the Court to affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeals.\nI would dismiss these appeals.\nFauteux J.:\u2014At the Summer Assizes of the Court of King's Bench, held in the Eastern Judicial District, Province of Manitoba, the appellants were jointly tried, and on the 25th of October 1950, found guilty on three counts of conspiracy, i.e., conspiracy (a) to possess, (b) to sell, and (c) to cause to be carried in Canada, without first having obtained a licence from the Minister of National Health and Welfare, or other lawful authority, drugs within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.\nEach of the appellants entered an appeal 85 against these convictions, raising inter alia, the following points: beyond the prima facie proof, resulting from the production of several certificates of analysis, it was argued that there was no evidence establishing that the drugs referred to therein were drugs within the meaning of the Act, and that such certificates, admissible as such proof on a charge of actual possession, sale or transport, were inadmissible on a charge of conspiracy to possess, sell or transport. These contentions eventually turned out to be those on which the appeal fell to be determined. During the hearing, without acceding to the appellants' views, the respondent, nonetheless, applied for and obtained permission of the Court of Appeal\u2014under section 1021 of the Criminal Code\u2014to take and introduce in the record, the oral evidence of the two Dominion analysts who had issued these certificates filed at trial. The new evidence having been taken and considered, the appeals were dismissed.\nThereupon and pursuant to an application made under section 1025 (1) of the Code, the appellants applied for and obtained leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law:\n(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section 1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?\n(2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or was it authorized merely to order a new trial?\nIn my view, it does not appear necessary, for the proper determination of this appeal, to deal with these two questions. For, while the additional evidence, introduced in appeal, might serve to confirm the conviction that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the premises, I have reached the conclusion that such evidence was not essential to legally support the verdict rendered. In my view, as I propose to show, the certificates of analysis were, in this prosecution, admissible evidence of the facts therein stated and, in any event, the record discloses that the defence, at trial, either chose\u2014as it was, by law, entitled\u2014not to hold the Crown to strict proof with respect to this particular issue, or else, opted to attempt to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.\nAs to the admissibility of the certificates of analysis, Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act\u2014hereinafter referred to as the Act\u2014is the relevant section. The opening words of the English and French versions governing its operation must be quoted:\nIn any prosecution under this Act \u2026 Dans toute poursuite sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi \u2026\nThe adequate interpretation of these opening words cannot legally be gained by merely considering them only within the narrow compass of the section, or even of the Act in which they are found. It must rather be gathered in the full light of the relevant provisions of the Interpretation Act, particularly sections 15 and 28. The true import of section 15 was recently considered in Robinson or Robertson v. The King 86, particularly at pages 529, 530. Section 28 was equally considered by this Court in Simcovitch v. The King 87. In that case, Sir Lyman Duff, applying the provisions of the latter section to section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, under which the appellants were prosecuted, said that section 191 must be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal Code apply-to the offences created by it. The same principle must prevail as to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act and so must its provisions, creating offences, be read and construed.\nIn this broader view, the following may be said. The opening words of section 18 are, on one hand, quite adequate to prevent the application of the section in the case of a prosecution entirely foreign to the Act, e.g. one exclusively under the Code. Thus, if a person sells a quantity of drugs, falsely representing them to be heroin, and obtains thereby a sum of money, the Crown could not, on a prosecution under section 405 of the Criminal Code, prove by means of a certificate of a Dominion analyst, the nature of the drugs sold, for this would not be a prosecution authorized under the Act. I cannot, however, convince myself that the all-embracing meaning of the language \"In any prosecution under this Act\", would be apt to include within the operation of section 18, prosecutions of offences nominally mentioned in the Act\u2014such as the sale of drugs\u2014and at the same time, be apt to exclude from its operation prosecutions of the other offences\u2014such as counselling or conspiring to sell drugs\u2014which Parliament by, and only by, the very same provision in the Act, virtually created and, therefore, rendered subject to prosecution. By force of section 28, in making the sale of drugs an offence, Parliament effectively thereby made the counselling of a sale, or the conspiracy to sell drugs, offences, and authorized by the Act itself, in each case, a prosecution. The prosecution of any of these offences is, in my view, a prosecution under the Act. The opening words of section 18 are not \"In any prosecution for an offence under the Act\", but \"In any prosecution under the Act\".\nIn Desrochers v. The King 88, a case which was not quoted before the Manitoba Court of Appeal nor on the application for leave to appeal to this Court, the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec has, on a charge of conspiracy to commit an offence under the Excise Act, admitted as evidence the certificate of analysis authorized under the latter Act in terms similar to those of section 18. This decision, rendered in 1937, was always followed in the Province of Quebec.\nI do not find it necessary, however, to discuss this point any further, for the following reason, which led me to the conclusion that the additional evidence, introduced in appeal, was unessential to legally support the verdict rendered by the jury, is by itself sufficient.\nAs indicated above, the record in this case discloses the following facts: Defence counsel at trial entirely and consistently refrained from making any objection when these certificates\u2014twelve in number\u2014were filed by the Crown; properly notified, pursuant to a local practice, of the actual presence in Court of one of the Dominion analysts, who had issued some of them, and that, if heard, his testimony would bear on the facts therein appearing, counsel for the defence not only refrained from taking advantage of the opportunity to cross-examine him but positively indicated the intention not to do so; at the close of the evidence for the prosecution, a motion for non suit was made on behalf of the appellants, but the point as to the admissibility of the certificates was not even mentioned; the appellants were not heard at trial, nor was there any evidence adduced by the defence, nor was there any attempt to assail the facts mentioned in the certificates.\nAt the close of the judge's address, several objections were made by counsel for the defence; but, again, and though the judge had, in plain terms, instructed the jury that the certificates were positive evidence of the facts they mentioned, nothing was said, in this respect, by the defence. The verdict was rendered late on the afternoon of the 25th and the sentence imposed in the forenoon of the 26th and, on the same day, the notice of appeal which was served revealed, for the first time, this ground for complaint.\nA large discretion is given to counsel in the conduct of the defence. Particularly, and under section 978 of the Criminal Code, it was open to counsel to make any admission as to any of the issues which the Crown had to prove as part of its case. Likewise, and in respect to the relevant issue, the defence had the discretion not to hold the Crown to strict legal proof. In my view, the whole conduct of the defence, in this case, manifested at trial a positive intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the facts therein stated, and to disregard them as one of the issues on which the case was fought, by the accused, represented by counsel.\nIn Davis and Ridley 89, Darling J., as he then was, said at page 139:\nIt is stated that in opening the case, counsel for the prosecution stated matters which were not evidence against the appellant Davis on his trial, but we have been unable to find the admission of any evidence that could be objected to; but if it were so, if counsel on the other side do not object, it is not obligatory on the judge to do so. When a prisoner is defended by counsel and he chooses, for reasons of his own, to allow such evidence to be let in without objection, he cannot come here and ask to have the verdict revised on that ground.\nIn The King v. Sanders 90, the accused was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. During his opening speech, counsel for the prosecution proposed to read copies of letters alleged to have been written to the appellant by the prosecutor's wife and solicitor. As no notice to produce the original letters had been given to the defence, objection was taken and maintained \u00e4s to the reading of such copies. However and in the course of the examination of the complainant by the Crown, these copies were admitted in evidence without any objection from counsel for the defence. The accused having been convicted, appealed on the ground that the copies of the letters were wrongly admitted. The judgment of the Court (Bray, Avory and Sankey, JJ.) was delivered by Bray J. At page 553, Bray J. said:\nIn our opinion, if it was intended to rely on this point, the objection should have been repeated at the time the evidence was tendered, and not having been taken then, it cannot now be taken in this Court, at all events, when the prisoner was represented by counsel.\nSaid Viscount Simon in Stirland v. The Director of Public Prosecutions 91.\nThere is no universal rule that a conviction cannot be quashed on the ground of the improper admission of evidence prejudicial to the prisoner unless an application is made at the time by counsel for the prisoner for the trial to begin again before another jury. It has been said more than once that a judge when trying a case should not wait for objection to be taken to the admissibility of the evidence but should stop such questions himself. If that be the judge's duty it can hardly be fatal to an appeal founded on the admission of an improper question that counsel failed at the time to raise the matter. No doubt the Court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a bearing on the question whether the accused was really \"prejudiced.\" It is not a proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the time in order to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.\nThese authorities are sufficient to support the proposition that, as to the consequences of the failure to object, there is no steadfast rule, and that, while the failure to object to inadmissible evidence is not always fatal, it cannot be said that it is never so.\nIndeed, as stated by Lord Sankey in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions 92:\n\u2026 the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed and that no rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of the jury fairly trying the true issues. The sanction for the observance of the rules of evidence in criminal cases is that, if they are broken in any case, the conviction may be quashed.\nIn the present case, however, the record, as indicated above, discloses more than a mere omission to object, as it shows a consistent conduct in this respect and a clear and positive intention not to deal with this particular point as being one in controversy in the case.\nIt might be, as it was intimated, that the defence acted in this way to preserve a possible ground of appeal; if so, the open conduct of the defence sufficiently defeats such a purpose, to which I would not find it consonant with the due administration of justice, to give effect.\nWith all these circumstances, there was, in the premises, no principle involved, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThe appeal, in each case, should be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: C.

The road was in a good condition; the appellant was driving between 40 and 50 miles per hour and says that he probably dropped suddenly into sleep. There was no evidence of any other fact or circumstance that would point to any other cause. The action taken by the respondent, who as a passenger was severely injured, was dismissed by the trial judge but maintained by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal on the amount of damages allowed.\nHeld: The appellant had the onus of establishing that the accident which, but for his negligence, should not have happened in the normal course of things, was caused by an extrinsic fact for which he could not be held responsible. Not only has he failed to show any such element to justify the Court to find that the accident was due to a cause out of his control, but he admitted that he probably fell asleep\u2014which would be a fault. (Scott v. St. Katherine Docks (1865) 3 H. & C. 596; Ottawa Electric Co. v. Crepin [1931] S.C.R. 407 and Demers v. Demers Q.R. (1931) 37 R. de J. 161 referred to).\nHeld, also: In the circumstances of this case, the driver's liability was not negatived by the so-called joint venture arising from the fact that the passengers and the driver were going on a shooting trip by automobile, all the expenses, including the cost of the gasoline and oil for the automobile, being borne equally: there was no acceptance of the risk of the culpable act nor renunciation to the right to claim damages resulting from the negligence of the driver. Even if there had been a mandate\u2014which is doubtful\u2014the driver's fault could not be excused under Art. 1710 C.C.\nHeld further: There being a relation causa causans between the accident and the respondent's subsequent hospitalization for tuberculosis, the respondent is not barred from claiming compensation for that by the fact that he had before the accident tuberculosis in a latent state. Any aggravation of a sickness caused by an accident can be the subject of an action in indemnity against the author of the quasi-delict.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1 reversing the decision of the trial judge and maintaining the action. Jacques de Billy, K.C., for the appellant. There is no presumption in favour of the plaintiff, who was a gratuitous passenger. He had the onus of proving the cause of the accident and that such cause was due to the fault, negligence and carelessness of the appellant. Nobody can say how the accident happened. The plaintiff has not discharged that onus and has not proved how the accident happened. I e only proved that the appellant lost control of his car, which is not sufficient to condemn him or even create a presumption of fact against him. The control can be lost for a number of reasons which cannot be blamed on the driver. Loss of control is not a fault or indicative of fault. It cannot be sufficient in an action against a driver to allege that he has lost control of his car without mentioning any fault. (McKenzie v. Meyers 2, Perusse v. Stafford 3, Lacombe v. Power 4 and McLean v. Pettigrew 5).\nThe appellant admits the possibility of his having gone to sleep, but he recalls nothing. The only duty that the driver owed to his passengers was not to do anything negligently and falling asleep in the circumstances of this case was not a fault. Parent & Colonial v. Garneau 6. However, it was not proved that the accident was due to the appellant going to sleep at the wheel. And even if that had been proved, since the evidence proved that he went to sleep suddenly without forewarning, there would be no responsibility (Lajimondiere v. Pritchard & Duff 7). There was no negligence for him to drive at night.\nEven if the appellant was found at fault, he should not be condemned because the trip constituted a common venture of which the plaintiff was part. The trip was a pleasure trip, a hunting trip which had been conceived, prepared, organized and executed jointly by the plaintiff and all the other occupants of the car, all the travelling expenses, including the cost of the gasoline, being shared. In the circumstances, the following jurisprudence should apply: McKenzie v. Meyers (supra), St. Pierre v. Trois Rivieres 8, Trumbower v. Lehigh Valley Ry. 9 and Jensen v. Chicago, Minn. & St. Paul 10. The plaintiff accepted the risk involved in travelling at night after a day of work and after having eaten and drunk, if it should be found that these facts had any relation to the accident.\nAs a corollory of the theory of common venture, the appellant may be said to have been the mandatary of his companions when driving the car. In this connection, Art. 1710 C.C. could apply.\nOn the question of the cross-appeal re the amount awarded, it is submitted that since in Quebec the hospital and medical costs of all persons suffering from tuberculosis are paid by the Province, there was a good reason for the Court not to award any amount on that item.\nL. A. Pouliot, K.C., and G. Mercier for the respondent. The rule res ipsa loquitur is applicable to this case (Scott v. London & St. Katherine Docks 11, Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel 12 and Gauthier v. The King 13). The case of Demers v. Demers 14 is also relied upon.\nThe theory of common venture cannot be sustained. That theory is foreign to our law. A party who travels in a car, driven by his friend or companion, does not in any way assume the risks of a trip brought about by the fault of the driver. On the contrary, he is entitled to ask that the driver will drive him safely to his destination, and will not commit a fault; the more so if he pays his share of the expenses of the trip. The theory of common venture has been rejected by our Court of Appeal in Parent & Colonial v. Garneau 15. The case of Langevin v. Beauchamp 16 is also relied upon. It is useless to say that the case might be different when a party undertakes a trip with a driver manifestly under the influence of liquors and unfit to drive a car, when that is not the case here. The cases of Letang v. Ottawa Electric Co. 17 and Osmond v. McColl Frontenac Oil Co. 18 are also cited. The reduction of the damages claimed on account of previous tuberculosis is wrong on the law and on the facts of the case. In law, whether a party suffers from a latent tuberculosis, he is nevertheless entitled to claim the full damages caused by the birth or eclosion or even aggravation of such sickness. Morin v. C.N.R. 19).\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Je suis d'accord avec mon coll\u00e9gue, M. le Juge Taschereau. Comme lui, je rejetterais l'appel principal, avec d\u00e9pens, et je maintiendrais le contre-appel, \u00e9galement avec d\u00e9pens, en ajoutant au montant d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 au demandeur-intim\u00e9 par le jugement a quo la somme de $2,000, formant en tout une somme de $6,772, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le 15 juin 1950.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014Le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant et quatre autres compagnons, ont quitt\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec vers neuf heures P.M. le 29 octobre 1948, pour se rendre dans le comt\u00e9 de Rimouski, o\u00f9 l'on projetait une excursion de chasse. Le d\u00e9part s'effectua dans l'automobile du defendeur qu'il conduisait lui-m\u00eame, et pr\u00e9s de St-Pascal, dans le comt\u00e9 de Kamouraska, la voiture quitta la route, et apres avoir capot\u00e9 plusieurs fois sur elle-m\u00eame, elle alla s'arr\u00eater dans un champ voisin. Comme r\u00e9sultat de cet accident, quatre des voyageurs furent s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9s, et un autre perdit la vie.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le Juge Gibsone, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a rejet\u00e9 l'action, mais la Cour d'Appel 20, l'a unanimement accueillie, et a accord\u00e9 au demandeur la somme de $4,772, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens. C'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il n'y a eu aucune preuve de n\u00e9gligence de sa part, et que le demandeur a accept\u00e9 tous les risques de ce voyage, qui constituait ce qu'il appelle une \"aventure commune.\"\nVoyons en premier lieu s'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9fendeur dans la conduite de sa voiture. Avant de s'embarquer \u00e0 bord du Traversier pour se rendre \u00e0 L\u00e9vis, les voyageurs se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission des Liqueurs, o\u00f9 ils ont achet\u00e9 deux bouteilles de gin, quarante-huit canistres de bi\u00e9re, et quelques autres douzaines de bouteilles de cette derni\u00e9re boisson. La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e9le pas cependant qu'au cours du voyage entre L\u00e9vis et St-Pascal, le d\u00e9fendeur ait fait un abus exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de liqueurs alcooliques. Il aurait consomm\u00e9 au plus trois canistres de bi\u00e9re, avant de s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 St-Pac\u00f4me avec ses compagnons, vers une heure moins dix du matin, pour prendre un peu de nourriture \u00e0 un restaurant de l'endroit. C'est apr\u00e9s avoir pris ce repas que les cinq compagnons ont repris leur route vers Rimouski, o\u00f9 ils devaient arriver le matin vers cinq heures.\nPeu apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 St-Pac\u00f4me, seul le chauffeur ne dormait pas dans la voiture. Les quatre autres, soit \u00e0 cause de l'heure tardive, soit \u00e0 cause de la bi\u00e9re consomm\u00e9e, ou du repas qu'ils venaient de prendre, dormaient profond\u00e9ment. Mais ils t\u00e9moignent qu'avant de s'endormir ainsi, le d\u00e9fendeur conduisait sa voiture d'une fa\u00e7on prudente, \u00e0 une vitesse moyenne de quarante ou cinquante milles \u00e0 l'heure. Ils n'ont pas eu connaissance de l'accident, et ne peuvent expliquer comment il est arriv\u00e9. Le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame l'ignore; il jure qu'il s'est r\u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. C'est l'une des victimes, moins bless\u00e9e que les autres, qui a r\u00e9ussi, quelque temps apr\u00e9s l'accident, \u00e0 se rendre pr\u00e9s de la route, et \u00e0 attirer l'attention des passants qui ont vu \u00e0 ce que les voyageurs soient hospitalis\u00e9s \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e9re-du-Loup. Roland Lajoie, le premier \u00e0 arriver sur les lieux, t\u00e9moigne que la voiture \u00e9tait dans le champ, \u00e0 environ cinquante pieds de la route, et que la cl\u00f4ture \u00e9tait d\u00e9molie sur une assez grande \u00e9tendue, \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 le chemin fait une courbe.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant que l'accident demeure inexpliqu\u00e9, et que sa n\u00e9gligence, n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 sa responsabilite civile, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Il soumet diverses hypoth\u00e9ses comme l'\u00e9clatement d'un pneu, une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 subite de la voiture, un obstacle sur la route, toutes des causes possibles de l'accident, mais qui lui sont \u00e9trang\u00e9res, et dont il ne pourrait \u00eatre responsable. Mais tous ces facteurs inconnus ne sont que des conjectures, qui n'ont pas la force probante n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre aux tribunaux de tirer une conclusion. C'est par la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que les causes doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, et c'est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e9re de ce que r\u00e9v\u00e9lent les faits les plus probables, que les responsabilit\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies. Il n'y a pas, dans le cas qui nous occupe, de pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale qui p\u00e9se sur le d\u00e9fendeur. Pour qu'il soit tenu responsable des cons\u00e9quences de l'accident dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame une malheureuse victime, sa faute doit \u00eatre, prouv\u00e9e. Il n'est pas essentiel qu'elle le soit par une preuve directe; elle peut l'\u00eatre par les conclusions que les circonstances justifient de tirer, et par les inf\u00e9rences qui d\u00e9coulent des faits \u00e9tablis.\nQuand, dans le cours normal des choses, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne doit pas se produire, mais arrive tout de m\u00eame, et cause un dommage a autrui, et quand il est \u00e9vident qu'il ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 s'il n'y avait pas eu de n\u00e9gligence, alors, c'est \u00e0 l'auteur de ce fait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a une cause \u00e9trang\u00e9re, dont il ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable et qui est la source de ce dommage. Si celui qui avait le contr\u00f4le de la chose r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour, l'existence du fait extrins\u00e9que, il aura droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exon\u00e9ration. C'est ce principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel d'Angleterre, et qui me semble conforme \u00e0 la logique la plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Dans Scott v. London & St. Catherine Docks Co. 21, d\u00e9cision accept\u00e9e par la Cour Supreme, Ottawa Electric v. Cr\u00e9pin 22, il est dit ce qui suit:\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\nC'est aussi l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par M. le Juge Bouffard de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec, dans une cause de Demers v. Demers 23, o\u00f9 il dit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur avait alors le contr\u00f4le de son automobile et qu'il en etait le conducteur et que, pour d\u00e9gager sa responsabilit\u00e9, il devait prouver une force \u00e9trang\u00e9re \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame ou \u00e0 son automobile qui l'a jet\u00e9 dans le foss\u00e9 et que si non, il y a pr\u00e9somption que c'est par la faute du d\u00e9fendeur, comme conducteur, ou par la v\u00e9tust\u00e9 de ses pneus, ou autre cause semblable, si l'automobile a pris cette direction; car, la machine d'elle-m\u00eame ne pouvait prendre la direction du foss\u00e9;\nLes faits dans le litige qui nous est soumis, cadrent bien dans cette r\u00e9gie de droit. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la voiture \u00e9tait en bon ordre, un mod\u00e8le Ford de 1941, et rien ne peut laisser soup\u00e7onner qu'un pneu ait \u00e9clat\u00e9, que le m\u00e9canisme ait fait d\u00e9faut, ou qu'une obstruction sur la route ait fait d\u00e9vier la voiture. Sur ces points, la preuve me para\u00eet dans le sens oppos\u00e9. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment ext\u00e9rieur n'est \u00e9tabli, qui puisse justifier la Cour de penser que cet accident est d\u00fb \u00e0 une cause en dehors du contr\u00f4le du d\u00e9fendeur. Bien au contraire, quand on lui demande comment est arriv\u00e9 l'accident, le d\u00e9fendeur, apr\u00e9s avoir \u00e9limin\u00e9 toutes les causes possibles, est bien oblig\u00e9 d'admettre qu'il s'est endormi au volant. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nJ'en d\u00e9duis personnellement que j'ai d\u00fb m'endormir, je ne peux rien affirmer.\nIl pouvait difficilement expliquer d'une autre mani\u00e9re la fin tragique de ce voyage. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il dise qu'il \"ne peut rien affirmer\", ceci ne d\u00e9truit pas la force de son premier aveu, que d'ailleurs il r\u00e9p\u00e8te plus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nJ'en d\u00e9duis, c'est \u00e7a que je d\u00e9duis, le Coroner \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate a d\u00e9duit \u00e7a.\nIl n'est pas \u00e9tonnant qu'il en f\u00fbt ainsi: le d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail toute la journ\u00e9e; sur la route il avait consomm\u00e9 trois canistres de bi\u00e9re, il avait mang\u00e9 des ''hot dogs\" et des \"hamburgers\" \u00e0 St-Pac\u00f4me, ses quatre compagnons dormaient profond\u00e9ment dans la voiture, il \u00e9tait une heure et demie de la nuit; et sans s'\u00eatre rendu coupable d'exag\u00e9ration depuis Qu\u00e9bec jusqu'\u00e0 St-Pac\u00f4me, il pouvait au proc\u00e9s, facilement conclure qu'il s'etait endormi. C'est l'explication la plus logique et la plus probable. Il semble inutile d'ajouter que c'est une negligence qui fait na\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9, que de s'endormir au volant de sa voiture. Les pi\u00e9tons, les conducteurs des autres v\u00e9hicules sur les chemins publics, de m\u00eame que les passagers payants ou gratuits, ont droit de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que le conducteur d'une voiture soit \u00e9veill\u00e9 quand il est au volant.\nMais l'appelant ajoute qu'il s'agissait au cours de ce voyage, d'une \"aventure commune\", et que s'il comportait des risques, le demandeur les a assum\u00e9s, et qu'il ne peut aujourd'hui r\u00e9clamer les dommages qu'il a soufferts. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que les cinq compagnons, qui partaient en excursion de chasse, partageaient les d\u00e9penses de ce voyage. Leur but commun \u00e9tait de se rendre \u00e0 Biencourt dans le comt\u00e9 de Rimouski, dans la voiture conduite par le d\u00e9fendeur. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois que les m\u00eames compagnons faisaient un semblable voyage. D\u00e9j\u00e0, dans l'automobile d'un autre, aux m\u00eames conditions, les cinq amis \u00e9taient all\u00e9s \u00e0 la chasse ou \u00e0 la p\u00eache. S'ils doivent, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des passagers gratuits, dont le d\u00e9fendeur serait le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, ils peuvent tenir ce dernier responsable, m\u00eame de sa faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re. Dans certaines provinces, la loi d\u00e9nie l'action en dommages au passager gratuit, et dans d'autres, elle exige la faute lourde du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, pour que sa responsabilit\u00e9 soit engag\u00e9e; mais dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 cause de l'absence d'un statut sp\u00e9cial, ces cas sont r\u00e9gis par la r\u00e9gie contenue en l'article 1053 C.C. La levissima culpa engendre la responsabilit\u00e9. (McLean v. Pettigrew 24; Langevin v. Beauchamp 25; Parent v. British Colonial 26). Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, la Cour d'Appel disait:\nLe chauffeur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole est responsable des dommages soufferts par la personne qu'il transporte, dans un accident d'automobile caus\u00e9 par sa faute m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\nMais si d'autre part, il y a v\u00e9ritablement un \"joint adventure\", une aventure commune, Pintim\u00e9 est-il priv\u00e9 de son recours? Je ne le crois pas. Evidemment, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, et il se pr\u00e9sentera encore des cas extr\u00eames o\u00f9 le passager ne pourra r\u00e9clamer, et d'autres o\u00f9 il sera tenu solidairement responsable avec le conducteur, du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 autrui, mais la r\u00e8gie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et les faits de la cause actuelle ne justifient pas une pareille conclusion.\nEn consentant \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Rimouski dans la voiture de l'appelant, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de r\u00e9clamer les dommages dont il pourrait \u00eatre la victime, \u00e0 cause de la n\u00e9gligence du conducteur. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il ait accept\u00e9 de payer sa part des d\u00e9penses, il avait le droit de penser qu'il ne s'engageait pas dans une aventure, o\u00f9, sans recours de sa part, sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 serait en p\u00e9ril. (Gauthier v. le Roi 27). Sans doute, s'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 passager gratuit, sa reclamation serait indiscutable. N'a-t-il pas droit, s'il paye, \u00e0 une protection encore plus grande?\nC'est sur l'article 1710 C.C. que l'appelant base sa pr\u00e9tention que Pintim\u00e9 lui a confi\u00e9 un mandat de conduire la voiture, et que les circonstances, a cause de \"l'aventure commune\", justifient une mitigation de la rigueur de la responsabilit\u00e9. Cet article se lit ainsi:\nLe mandataire, dans l'ex\u00e9cution du mandat, doit agir avec l'habilet\u00e9 convenable et tous les bons soins d'un bon p\u00e9re de famille.\nN\u00e9anmoins, si le mandat est gratuit, le tribunal peut mitiger la rigueur de la responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de la n\u00e9gligence ou de la faute du mandataire, suivant les circonstances.\nJe ne puis admettre ce raisonnement. M\u00eame s'il s'agissait d'un mandat, (ce qui est douteux, car je ne suis pas certain que nous sommes vis-\u00e0-vis un contrat, o\u00f9 la gestion d'une affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne, qui s'est oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuter), il me semble que les devoirs de prudence qu'indique 1710 C.C. excluent la maladresse et l'inhabilet\u00e9 dont l'appelant s'est rendu coupable. Le temp\u00e9rament n'op\u00e8re que dans le cas de mandat gratuit, et ici, il est r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. M\u00eame, s'il s'agissait d'un mandat gratuit, il n'y a pas de circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, qui justifient une mitigation. Pour ces raisons, je suis d'avis que l'appel ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\nMais le demandeur n'est pas satisfait du montant que lui a accord\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi 28, et par moyen de contre-appel, il demande qu'il soit augment\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9, ayant souffert comme r\u00e9sultat de l'accident, de traumatismes cr\u00e2nien, cervical et du pied. Les m\u00e9decins \u00e9valuent son incapacit\u00e9 partielle et permanente \u00e0 8 \u00e0 10%, attribuable aux traumatismes seulement, sans tenir compte de l'\u00e9tat pulmonaire, dont je parlerai plus loin. La Cour lui a accord\u00e9 les montants suivants:\n463.00 pour frais de m\u00e9decin et d'hospitalisation \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital de la Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup;\n1,120.00 perte de salaire;\n44.00 perte d'habits;\n130.00 souffrances;\n3,000.00 incapacite partielle permanente;\n15.00 (sur $17.50), Pharmacie de Giffard;\n$4,772.00\nApr\u00e8s \u00eatre demeur\u00e9 a l'h\u00f4pital, \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, durant environ un mois, le demandeur revint chez lui \u00e0 Giffard, o\u00f9 il s\u00e9journa pendant trois mois, pour ensuite aller a l'h\u00f4pital Laval \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait encore au moment du proc\u00e8s. Il souffre de tuberculose, et il relie \u00e0 son accident la cause ou l'aggravation de cette maladie. La Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \"probl\u00e9matique\" d'\u00e9tablir une relation de cause \u00e0 effet, et a refus\u00e9 cette partie de la r\u00e9clamation.\nAnt\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'accident dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime, le demandeur faisait partie de l'Arm\u00e9e canadienne, et fut licenci\u00e9, nous dit-on, parce qu'il \u00e9tait atteint de tuberculose. Il ne semble pas cependant qu'il en ait senti les effets, car son travail de journalier et de menuisier ne fut jamais interrompu, et ce ne fut qu'apr\u00e8s l'accident qu'il a commence \u00e0 s'en ressentir. Le Docteur Barrette l'a soign\u00e9 \u00e0 Giffard, quelques semaines avant son entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Laval, mais il ignorait son \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur de sant\u00e9. Le Docteur Alphonse L'Esp\u00e9rance, surintendant de l'H\u00f4pital Laval, para\u00eet entretenir des doutes sur la date de l'origine de la maladie, mais affirme qu'un traumatisme est une cause du r\u00e9veil de la tuberculose latente, comme d'ailleurs un refroidissement, tel que celui auquel a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 l'appelant, apr\u00e9s l'accident. Depuis son entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, nous dit encore le Docteur L'Esp\u00e9rance, le demandeur a fait de grands progr\u00e9s. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il soit encore en p\u00e9riode d'evolution, et qu'il reste un foyer d'activit\u00e9, le poumon droit est gu\u00e9ri, et presque la totalit\u00e9 du poumon gauche. Il y a lieu d'esp\u00e9rer \u00e0 la guerison totale, mais \u00e0 cause des al\u00e9as, il est impossible de d\u00e9terminer l'incapacit\u00e9 future.\nLe Docteur Emile Fortier a constat\u00e9 que le demandeur souffrait de tuberculose pulmonaire ancienne. Comme le Docteur L'Esp\u00e9rance, il a constat\u00e9 que depuis son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, la condition de 1'appelant s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, et ajoute que le traumatisme peut sans doute \u00e9tre une cause d'augmentation de r\u00e9action congestive des foyers de tuberculose.\nL'ensemble de cette preuve me convainc que le demandeur souffrait de tuberculose depuis assez longtemps, mais que l'accident a provoque un r\u00e9veil des foyers d\u00e9j\u00e0 atteints. Le violent traumatisme dont l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime, de m\u00eame que cette longue exposition au froid, durant cette nuit de fin d'octobre, sont sans doute les causes du regain de l'activit\u00e9 tuberculeuse. Ce serait admettre une \u00e9trange coincidence que de ne pas voir une relation entre l'accident et l'\u00e9tat subs\u00e9quent de la victime. Si l'on tient compte qu'avant le choc qu'il a subi, l'appelant durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, n'avait jamais perdu une heure de travail, qu'il ne ressentait pas les effets de sa maladie latente, et si l'on consid\u00e8re que les m\u00e8decins indiquent comme causes du r\u00e8veil des foyers tuberculeux, le traumatisme et l'exposition au froid, il faut n\u00e8cessairement attribuer 1'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la maladie \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res influences. Une pr\u00e9disposition \u00e0 une maladie n'est pas une fin de non recevoir. Toute aggravation caus\u00e9e par un accident donne ouverture \u00e0 une action en indemnit\u00e9, dont est responsable l'auteur du quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nLe demandeur a droit \u00e0 un montant additionnel. Au moment o\u00f9 s'est instruit le proc\u00e8s, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Laval depuis au dela d'un an, et malgr\u00e9 une am\u00e9lioration que les m\u00e9decins ont constat\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait encore totalement invalide. Je crois qu'une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire de $2,000.00 pour couvrir les pertes et les inconv\u00e9nients dont il souffre et pour lesquels il r\u00e9clame, est une compensation ad\u00e9quate.\nJe suis en cons\u00e9quence d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, que le contre-appel doit \u00eatre maintenu \u00e9galement avec d\u00e9pens, et que jugement doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 contr\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur pour la somme de $6,772.00, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le 15 juin 1950.\nRand J.:\u2014In this appeal, two questions are raised: whether the Court of King's Bench 29, reversing the Superior Court, was justified in finding the car to have been driven negligently by the appellant; and whether the liability following that finding must be taken to be negatived by the special circumstances of the case.\nThose circumstances are these. A party of five, consisting of the appellant, respondent and three others, arranged to go on a shooting trip by automobile, all of the expenses of which, including the cost of gasoline and oil for the automobile, were to be borne equally. The car was owned and driven by the appellant. The party set out from Quebec late in the evening of October 29, 1948, planning to travel all night and to reach Biencourt, County of Rimouski, in the morning. Shortly after midnight they stopped at St.-Pac\u00f4me and ate a light lunch. About half an hour from that point, with the other members of the party asleep, the car left the road and after turning over several times stopped in a field about 50 feet from the highway. One member was killed and the respondent suffered severe injuries. The road was in ordinary, good condition, the appellant was driving between 40 and 50 miles per hour, and he says that he must suddenly have dropped into sleep. He had drunk two or three small cans of beer but it has been found that he was sober. There was no evidence of any other fact or circumstance that would point to any other cause. Notwithstanding that, Gibsone J. at trial held the cause had not been shown and dismissed the action. On appeal, the Court, taking the view suggested by the appellant, held his act to constitute a fault from which he was not absolved by the fact of the joint purpose of the party.\nThe burden on the appellant is to satisfy this Court that that judgment is clearly wrong, and this, in my opinion, he has not done. From the undisputed facts, the fair inference of the cause cannot be any other than what the Court has drawn, and that, in the circumstances, it could be found to have been a fault is, I think, entirely warranted. Operating such a dangerous agency, an automobile moving at high speed, a speed which, judging from the position and condition of the car, was probably greater than that mentioned, with the lives of four sleeping men in his keeping, the driver was under the highest degree of duty toward them. There is nothing to qualify the simple fact of falling asleep at the steering wheel; and ordinarily, drowsiness sends out its premonitory signals, a warning which in such circumstances is disregarded by a driver at his peril. At any rate, I am quite unable to say that the Court in appeal could not properly reach that conclusion here.\nThen there is the second question. In this we start with the fact of fault and its effect must be disposed of. The so-called joint venture has not, apparently, in this country been directly considered apart from statutory provisions dealing with guests and passengers in automobiles. Such a group action has two aspects: first, the liability of all for the negligence of one towards an outside person, of which there are many cases in the books; and then the relations and liabilities of the members inter se. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the basis of the contention that no liability between the individuals can arise from an act within the scope of their purpose. The controlling consideration is, I think, the acceptance of the risk of the culpable act. There being nothing express of that matter here, it must be evidenced as the presumed understanding between the parties on the footing of which they set about their objective. How, then, is a court to gather what, in any case, that was? What is to be found is the understanding the great majority of people more or less familiar with such relations would, in similar situations, consciously or unconsciously assume or would have assented to if the matter had been broached to them. Relations of that sort range from a gratuitous ride to a person at his own request to common carriage: from accommodation between friends, from acts of hospitality, to a purely economic, business or individual purpose relation. The owner in some of these may be taken, impliedly, as intimating to the guest or passenger that he must take things as they are, including the driving. In the absence of special circumstances, that would not ordinarily contemplate anything grossly, much less wilfully reckless in the driver's conduct; but it might include the oversight or inadvertence of daily experience. There is a limited analogy in giving permission to cross one's property: the person permitted may be understood to take the land as he finds it, or except for known and hidden dangers. These implications arise from habitual reactions to situations generally, as inarticulate judgments expressing themselves in vague intimations and acceptances, which are bound up in acquiescence.\nWhen a number of persons bargain to pay the expenses of the journey as here, they normally feel themselves, I should say, not to be gratuitous beneficiaries of the owner; rather they feel themselves to be in the automobile in some degree of right, certainly as under a much lower degree of obligation to him than if gratuitously. Sensing the commitment of their safety to the driver, they undoubtedly rely upon his appreciation of responsibility. That was certainly the case here. Such a conclusion is a deduction from the total circumstances, which may, of course, in any case, be qualified in any manner or degree or by any special feature. If, for example, when the party sets out, it is seen that the driver is under the influence of liquor, or even of sleepiness, and the members are still content that he should drive, the assumption of such a risk could very well be inferred; but there is nothing of that sort here. I am unable to conclude, therefore, that the respondent can be taken to have contemplated the particular carelessness of the appellant in driving as one of the hazards which were to be assumed by all as involved in their friendly outing.\nThe respondent has cross-appealed on the amount of damages awarded. On that I concur with my brother Taschereau.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, both with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gagnon & de Billy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.

The donors stipulated further that they were not creating a \"vraie substitution\", and each donee was given the right to dispose of his share equally or otherwise or even in favour of one only of his children or, if he had no children, between the children of his co-donee.\nBy his will, one of the donees instituted his two sons his universal residuary legatees and divided between them, by particular legacies his share of the gift. The will contained, inter alia, the stipulation that should either of the sons die without male issue, the properties bequeathed to him should revert to the other son him paying a certain sum of money to the daughters of the deceased son, if any.\nOne of these two sons of the donee having died, leaving two daughters but no male issue, the other son, the appellant, brought action to recover the properties pursuant to the terms of the donee's will. The action was maintained by the trial judge, but dismissed by a (majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: (The Chief Justice dissenting), that the appeal and the action should be dismissed since the testator exceeded the powers vested in him by the deed of donation.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. : The deed of donation created a fiduciary substitution with power to elect one or more substitutes and with even the right to exclude all but one. The institute, by his will, exercised that power of election, but the charge imposed by him to the substitute to return the property if he died wihout male issue, was null and without effect, since the power to elect does not by its own virtue give the right to impose charges and since the donation does not show any intention to derogate from that principle.\nThe argument that the substitute, having accepted the universal legacy, accepted at the same time the conditions attached thereto, is not tenable, because the substitute did not receive the property from the testator, but directly from the donors; and, in any event, there is no evidence as to whether he accepted or refused the succession or if there was in fact a residue.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau and Cartwright JJ.: It is not necessary to decide whether an institute with power of appointment can make his appointment subject to a resolutory condition, since the deed creating the substitution did not permit the institute to impose any conditions at all.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing Marchand and Surveyer (ad hoc) JJ.A. dissenting, the decision of the trial judge and dismissing the action.\nL. E. Beaulieu, K.C., for the appellant. The deed of gift created a fiduciary substitution whereupon the donee was named institute, with the special power of electing one or more substitutes amongst a given class of persons, and that election made by virtue of such special authority could be conditional as well as pure and simple (Arts. 925, 929, 932 C.C.). Although the right to elect is not specifically provided for in the Code, this right has always been admitted by the authors.\nThe institute vested with the right of election can validly attach to his election a resolutory condition. The donee could have excluded completely and absolutely his son Conrad from the very beginning. Why then could he not exclude him only in case a given event should happen. The authority to do more implies the authority to do less.\nThe principle that the right to elect does not include the right to impose a charge upon the person so elected is not disputed. But this principle has no application here, and to draw from that principle the conclusion that no resolutory condition can be attached to the election implies a total misconception of the true nature and character of a resolutory condition as well as of the legal effects of the accomplishment of such a condition (Arts. 1085 and 1088 C.C.).\nAs appears from the authors, there is no similarity between a resolutory condition and a charge, which is nothing else but an obligation. In fact, no authority has been quoted to support the contention that the right to elect a substitute does not include the right to make a conditional election.\nApplying the rules governing the resolutory condition and its effects, it is clear that a person elected as a substitute under a resolutory condition must be deemed to have never been elected if the condition is accomplished; that consequently, if Conrad was elected under a resolutory condition which was accomplished, he never was called upon to return the property, since he never received it, and that there was no addition of a supplementary degree to the substitution since Conrad never occupied a degree in it. If, as contended, he was elected under a resolutory condition which was realized, he was in the same position as if he had been originally excluded.\nThe election made by the institute under resolutory condition was in strict conformity with the text of the deed of donation as well as with the intentions of the donors. The leaving of male issue was \"an event future and uncertain\", upon which the dissolution of the election was made to depend, within the meaning of Art. 1079 C.C. Conrad having died without leaving male children, his election was dissolved with retroactive effect (1085 C.C), with the result that he must be deemed to have never been elected and the appellant, his brother, to have been originally the sole appointee.\nSubsidiarily and at all events, Conrad having accepted the universal legacy made to him by his father, accepted at the same time, the conditions attached thereto, including the proviso that the substituted property would revert to his brother, should he die without male issue (Arts. 641, 645, 651 C.C.). The heir who has accepted a succession is bound to discharge all the debts and liabilities of his \"auteur\". The reason is that the heir then continues the juridical personality of the de cujus: the two form only one juridical person. This obligation was also binding upon Conrad's heirs. These principles are more particularly applicable in the matter of substitution. Under Art. 935 C.C., an institute can impose upon a substitute entitled to get the property in full ownership, the obligation to return it to another person, if such is the condition of a new gift of another property. This is but another application of the principle that a person can bequeath and can substitute a thing belonging to a third party. In fact, Art. 881 C.C. provides that the legacy of a thing which does not belong to the testator \"is however valid, and is equivalent to the charge of procuring it or of paying its value, if such appears to have been the intention of the testator. In such case, if the thing bequeathed belongs to the heir or the legatee charged with the payment of it, whether the fact was known to the testator or not, the particular legatee is seized of the ownership of his legacy\".\nAssuming therefore, that under the deed of donation Conrad was entitled to get the substituted property in full ownership without any obligation to return it to anybody, he became however compelled to return it to his surviving brother when he accepted the universal legacy to which such a condition was attached.\nGustave Monette, K.C., for the respondent. An analysis of the deed of donation clearly reveals that it created a fiduciary substitution. All the authors agree that the right of election given an institute does not allow him to impose to the substitutes elected by him a charge not provided for in the deed creating the substitution. The institute in the present case had no other power than to exercise a pure election. As soon as he made his election, the substitutes could dispose absolutely of the property which they were deemed to have received directly from the donors and not from the institute. Any charge imposed to the substitutes was therefore null and without effect. A reading of the will shows that what was imposed was a charge and not a resolutory condition.\nThe substitution on a substitution is in reality the legacy of a thing belonging to a third party. It is forbidden under our Code, and the case here does not fall within the exceptions contained in Arts. 881 and 935 C.C. The institute cannot impose a new degree to a substitution since the object does not belong to him and comes directly to the substitute from the original grantor. The argument that Conrad accepted the conditions of the will by accepting the universal legacy, is not tenable because it does not appear whether Conrad accepted the succession.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014Le 13 juillet 1905, Joseph Lussier et son \u00e9pouse, Dame Ad\u00e9line Bonneau, firent donation entre vifs et irr\u00e9vocable \u00e0 l'un de leurs fils, Joseph Lussier, de certains biens mobiliers et immobiliers comprenant, entre autres, deux terres, avec maison et b\u00e2tisses ci-dessus construites, formant partie respectivement des lots nos 198 et 199 des Plan et Livre de Renvoi officiels de la paroisse de St-Philippe, dans le comt\u00e9 de Laprairie.\nCette donation comportait, entre autres clauses, les conditions suivantes:\na) Les biens ainsi donn\u00e9s devront rester propres au donataire. Ils n'entreront dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens avec son \u00e9pouse et le donataire ne pourra en aucune fa\u00e7on avantager son \u00e9pouse avec ces biens, soit par testament ou autrement; ces biens doivent rester au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers du donataire, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, nonobstant toute loi ou coutume contraire.\nb) Le donataire aura le droit de faire entre ses enfants, et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants, \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire (d'autres immeubles dans la m\u00eame donation) le partage de ces immeubles, comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement, soit autrement et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin.\nc) Enfin, au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s du donataire sans disposition de ses biens, ceux provenant des donateurs devront \u00eatre partag\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre ses enfants, ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants, \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire.\nPar son testament, en date du 20 octobre 1922, le donataire Joseph Lussier, fils, a institu\u00e9 ses deux fils, Anatole et Conrad, ses l\u00e9gataires universels, en propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais il leur a, en outre, l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 titre particulier les deux immeubles acquis en vertu de la donation sus-d\u00e9crite, savoir: \u00e0 Conrad Lussier, la terre faisant partie du lot n\u00b0 199, et \u00e0 Anatole Lussier (appelant), la terre portant le n\u00b0 198.\nCependant, les legs ainsi faits respectivement \u00e0 l'appelant et \u00e0 Conrad Lussier contenaient les conditions suivantes:\na) Que les terrains ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 mes dits fils leur restent propres et n'entrent dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens d'entre eux et toutes \u00e9pouses avec qui ils pourront contracter mariage \u00e0 l'avenir, et qu'ils ne puissent non plus avantager leurs \u00e9pouses \u00e0 m\u00eame les dits terrains de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit;\nb) que \"si les dits Anatole ou Conrad Lussier d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans enfants m\u00e2les ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e8dent eux-m\u00eames, avant leur majorit\u00e9 sans descendants, les dits terrains \u00e0 eux sus-l\u00e9gu\u00e9s ou ceux acquis en remploi, \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9dera ainsi, de m\u00eame que ces dits enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re co-l\u00e9gataire ou si ce dit fr\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les en remettant quatre mille piastres aux filles du d\u00e9funt, s'il y en a.\"\nJoseph Lussier, fils, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 28 ao\u00fbt 1924 sans avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 le testament dont il vient d'\u00eatre question.\nConrad Lussier est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 2 mai 1944 sans laisser d'enfants m\u00e2les, mais en laissant deux filles alors mineures, savoir: Jovette et Fernande.\nEn interpr\u00e9tant litt\u00e9ralement les clauses du testament que nous venons de reproduire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Conrad Lussier n'a laiss\u00e9 aucun enfant m\u00e2le, les biens mobiliers qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par son p\u00e8re, Joseph Lussier, fils, devaient retourner \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Anatole (appelant) qui en devenait ainsi le propri\u00e9taire absolu et incommutable, \u00e0 l'exclusion de tout autre, \u00e0 la charge de payer aux filles de Conrad une somme de $4,000. Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Conrad, la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e, agissant tant en son nom personnel qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses filles mineures, Fernande et Jovette, s'est empar\u00e9e ill\u00e9galement, d'apr\u00e8s l'appelant, de la terre d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant partie du lot n\u00b0 199, en pr\u00e9tendant qu'elle en avait l'usufruit et que ses deux filles mineures en avaient la nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de l'appelant.\nL'appelant Anatole Lussier, apr\u00e8s avoir somm\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e d'avoir \u00e0 quitter l'immeuble, ainsi que la maison et les d\u00e9pendances, ce que l'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de faire, a poursuivi cette derni\u00e8re et ses filles pour r\u00e9clamer l'immeuble en question, en se d\u00e9clarant pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer aux filles de Conrad la somme de $4,000, d\u00e8s que ses droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la terre ainsi revendiqu\u00e9e auront \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus judiciairement ou autrement.\nL'intim\u00e9e, par sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite, s'est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e de l'acte de donation du 13 juillet 1905 par Joseph Lussier, p\u00e8re, et son \u00e9pouse, entre autres \u00e0 leur fils Joseph Lussier, et a \u00e9mis la pr\u00e9tention que cette donation cr\u00e9ait une substitution \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des biens qui \u00e9taient donn\u00e9s \u00e0 ce dernier, par suite de quoi ses enfants \u00e9taient les appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs et sans obligation de rendre les biens \u00e0 qui que ce soit. Particuli\u00e8rement, les enfants de Joseph Lussier, fils, (Conrad et Anatole) devaient recevoir indivis\u00e9ment, d\u00e9finitivement et directement des donateurs les biens donn\u00e9s \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re. La donation enlevait au grev\u00e9 Joseph Lussier, fils, tout contr\u00f4le sur les biens \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des appel\u00e9s, sauf qu'elle accordait au dit grev\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire entre ses enfants et de leur partager \u00e9galement ou autrement, comme il y est dit, les immeubles donn\u00e9s.\nPar suite de cette facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire Joseph Lussier, fils, pouvait partager les biens entre ses divers enfants, et, par l'effet de ce partage, les enfants appel\u00e9s devenaient propri\u00e9taires absolus et d\u00e9finitifs de ceux des biens qui leur seraient ainsi octroy\u00e9s en partage, mais, alors, ils se trouvaient \u00e0 recevoir ces biens directement des donateurs sans que Joseph Lussier, fils, put attacher aucune condition ni restriction.\nLe testament de Joseph Lussier, fils, ayant fait le partage des biens substitu\u00e9s entre ses deux fils, Conrad et Anatole, ce partage a constitu\u00e9 l'\u00e9lection dont la facult\u00e9 lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9e par la donation, et, par le fait m\u00eame, Conrad Lussier, le mari et le p\u00e8re des intim\u00e9es, devint le propri\u00e9taire absolu de la terre qui lui fut attribu\u00e9e mais qu'il tient directement de la donation de ses grands-parents.\nToutes dispositions du testament de Joseph Lussier, fils, qui pourraient avoir l'effet d'affecter, de diminuer ou de restreindre le droit absolu et d\u00e9finitif de Conrad sont nulles et de nul effet comme outrepassant les pouvoirs du testateur qui ne poss\u00e9dait ces biens qu'\u00e0 titre de grev\u00e9 et suivant les termes de la substitution.\nOr, Conrad Lussier, ainsi devenu propri\u00e9taire absolu et d\u00e9finitif de la terre en question, a le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1943, par testament olographe, laiss\u00e9 tous ses biens en usufruit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, son \u00e9pouse, et en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses deux filles, et, par l'effet de ce testament de Conrad, les filles intim\u00e9es sont maintenant propri\u00e9taires absolues de la terre plus haut mentionn\u00e9e et leur m\u00e8re personnellement en est devenue usufruiti\u00e8re.\nLa d\u00e9fense a donc conclu que le demandeur-appelant n'avait aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de jouissance ou de possession ou autre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'immeuble qui fait l'objet des conclusions de sa d\u00e9claration et son action est mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit.\nA cette d\u00e9fense l'appelant a r\u00e9pondu que le testament de Conrad \u00e9tait inefficace et sans effet pour conf\u00e9rer quelque droit que ce soit aux intim\u00e9es.\nDans ces circonstances, l'appelant a r\u00e9ussi devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), (St-Jacques, Barclay et Casey, JJ.) 2 a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens l'action de l'appelant, Marchand et Surveyer ad hoc, JJ., se d\u00e9clarant dissidents.\nLes termes du testament de Joseph Lussier, fils, en faveur de ses enfants, Conrad et Anatole, sont tr\u00e8s clairs et ne laissent ouverture \u00e0 aucune interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente: il a partag\u00e9 les biens dont il disposait en faveur de ses fils, Conrad et Anatole, qu'il a institu\u00e9s ses l\u00e9gataires universels. En m\u00eame temps, il l\u00e9guait \u00e0 son fils Conrad la terre n\u00b0 199 en particulier.\nIl est admis de toutes parts que le legs ainsi fait tenait heu de l'\u00e9lection que la donation de Joseph Lussier, p\u00e8re, et son \u00e9pouse l'avaient autoris\u00e9 de faire. Les intim\u00e9es pr\u00e9tendent\u2014et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) leur a donn\u00e9 raison sur ce point\u2014que l\u00e0 devait s'arr\u00eater le pouvoir d'\u00e9lection de Joseph Lussier, fils, et que l'exercice de ce pouvoir constituait Conrad propri\u00e9taire absolu de la terre n\u00b0 199 avec le droit d'en disposer comme il l'entendrait.\nToute condition, soumettent les intim\u00e9es, attach\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection ainsi faite, n'\u00e9tait nullement autoris\u00e9e par la donation originaire. En imposant telles conditions \u00e0 Conrad, Joseph Lussier, fils, outrepassait les pouvoirs qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la donation de ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, et, par suite, ces conditions doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ill\u00e9gales et tenues pour non \u00e9crites.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, plaident les intim\u00e9es, les conditions en question \u00e9taient inefficaces pour restreindre le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue qui \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors d\u00e9volu \u00e0 Conrad, non pas par suite de l'acte de son p\u00e8re, Joseph Lussier, fils, mais directement \u00e0 raison de la donation de ses grands-parents, Joseph Lussier, p\u00e8re, et son \u00e9pouse.\nComme on le voit, il ne s'agit donc pas de l'interpr\u00e9tation du texte du testament par lequel Joseph Lussier, fils, a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la terre n\u00b0 199 \u00e0 Conrad. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, ce texte est clair et n'est susceptible d'aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. S'il a pu \u00eatre validement stipul\u00e9 par Joseph Lussier, fils, il doit recevoir tout son effet.\nLa question qui est soumise aux tribunaux n'en est pas une d'interpr\u00e9tation, mais exclusivement celle de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 des stipulations accessoires par lesquelles Joseph Lussier, fils, a entendu affecter l'\u00e9lection que, par son testament, il faisait de Conrad, en lui attribuant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la terre dont il s'agit.\nCe n'est donc pas dans le testament de Joseph Lussier, fils, qu'il faut chercher la solution du litige mais plut\u00f4t dans l'analyse de la donation originaire. En effet, ainsi que l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Auger v. Beaudry 3:\nIt is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and litteral meaning to the actual language of the will. Human motives are too uncertain to render it wise or safe to leave the firm guide of the words used for the uncertain direction of what it must be assumed that a reasonable man would mean. Et ce qui est dit l\u00e0 de l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un testament doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre dit d'une donation, au moins lorsque le donateur est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nOr, si on analyse la donation faite \u00e0 Joseph Lussier, fils, par son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, il faut y remarquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants:\nLe donataire re\u00e7oit pour \"jouir, user, faire et disposer des dits biens en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes\". Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 le langage du Code, \u00e0 l'article 944, en vertu duquel, en mati\u00e8re de substitution:\nLe grev\u00e9 poss\u00e8de pour lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 la charge de rendre et sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de l'appel\u00e9.\nIl y a une diff\u00e9rence \u00e9vidente, m\u00eame si elle est minime, entre jouir, user, faire et disposer des biens en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et poss\u00e9der \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 la charge de rendre. En effet, si le donataire peut, entre autres choses, disposer en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est le contraire de poss\u00e9der \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, \"\u00e0 la charge de rendre\".\nEnsuite, la donation stipule comme \"condition expresse et sous peine de nullit\u00e9\" que les biens donn\u00e9s devront rester propres au donataire et n'entrer dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens entre lui et son \u00e9pouse, les biens donn\u00e9s devant rester \"au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers du donataire, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, nonobstant toute loi ou coutume contraire\".\nLes donateurs d\u00e9clarent express\u00e9ment qu'ils \"n'entendent pas par l\u00e0 cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution\".\nJ'entends bien qu'une substitution peut \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9e sans que le mot lui-m\u00eame soit employ\u00e9 et que, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, c'est d'apr\u00e8s l'ensemble de l'acte et l'intention qui s'y trouve suffisamment manifest\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que d'apr\u00e8s l'adaptation ordinaire de certaines expressions, qu'il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il y a ou non substitution (C.C. 928). Mais, apr\u00e8s tout, les donateurs, qui \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires des biens donn\u00e9s, avaient bien le droit d'en disposer comme ils l'entendaient et c'est tout de m\u00eame une sommaire fa\u00e7on de donner \u00e0 cette clause, o\u00f9 ils d\u00e9clarent formellement qu'ils n'entendent pas cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution, l'interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire qu'ils en ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une. En vertu de cette donation, le donataire a le droit de faire entre ses enfants (et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants, \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire) le partage des immeubles \"comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin\".\nC'est clairement une autorisation absolue \"comme bon lui semblera \u2026 suivant qu'il avisera\".\nLes donateurs donnent aux donataires, \"nonobstant toutes conditions contraires\", le droit de faire entre eux toute vente ou \u00e9change des terrains qui leur sont respectivement donn\u00e9s, aux charges et conditions qui leur conviendront, et sans l'intervention des donateurs qui leur laissent tout pouvoir \u00e0 cette fin.\nCe pouvoir est attribu\u00e9 aux donataires nonobstant toutes conditions contraires et aux charges et conditions qui leur conviendront. N'est-il pas possible d'interpr\u00e9ter cette clause comme voulant dire que, si telle vente ou \u00e9change a lieu, elle pourra se faire sans tenir compte des conditions contraires qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans la donation et seulement en ayant \u00e9gard \"aux charges et conditions qui leur conviendront\"? Qu'adviendrait-il, alors, de la pr\u00e9tendue substitution?\nEnfin, la derni\u00e8re clause de la donation contient les mots suivants: \"L'intention des donateurs \u00e9tant que ce dernier terrain\" (celui qui est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Modeste Lussier) retournera \"aux gar\u00e7ons du dit Joseph Lussier, fils,\" au cas o\u00f9 Modeste Lussier ne laisserait pas de gar\u00e7ons issus de mariage l\u00e9gitime ou que ses gar\u00e7ons d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient en minorit\u00e9 et sans enfants m\u00e2les, \"l'intention des donateurs \u00e9tant que ce dernier terrain appartienne \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire du nom de Lussier tant qu'il sera possible dans leur famille\".\nOn remarquera que cette intention n'est pas que le terrain reste dans la famille, mais il est sp\u00e9cifiquement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il doit appartenir \"\u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire du nom de Lussier\".\nEn pr\u00e9sence de toutes les d\u00e9clarations que nous venons d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer et qui sont contenues dans la donation originaire, on ne saurait se d\u00e9fendre de l'impression que dans son testament Joseph Lussier, fils, s'en est inspir\u00e9.\nIl a \u00e9videmment trait\u00e9 la donation comme n'ayant pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 une \"vraie substitution\" de la terre n\u00b0 199; il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il ne la poss\u00e9dait pas seulement pour lui-m\u00eame \"\u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 la charge de rendre\" (qui est le texte m\u00eame de l'article 944 C.C.), mais comme pouvant en \"disposer \u2026 en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9\", suivant l'expression employ\u00e9e par les donateurs dans la donation originaire.\nIl a tenu compte de la \"condition expresse et sous peine de nullit\u00e9\" que la terre en question lui reste propre, n'entrant dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens entre lui et son \u00e9pouse, et demeure \"au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers du donataire, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, nonobstant toute loi ou coutume contraire\", ainsi que les donateurs l'avaient stipul\u00e9.\nIl a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le droit que lui donnait la donation de faire entre ses enfants le partage des immeubles, \"comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin\", comme lui donnant le droit, relativement \u00e0 la terre n\u00b0 199, d'en disposer par testament, ainsi qu'il l'a fait.\nIl s'est dit que si, \"nonobstant toute condition contraire\", il pouvait, en conformit\u00e9 avec la donation, faire avec son fr\u00e8re Modeste toute vente ou \u00e9change des terrains qui leur \u00e9taient respectivement donn\u00e9s (y compris la terre n\u00b0 199), aux charges et conditions qui leur conviendraient\u2014ce qui in\u00e9vitablement implique le pouvoir de faire dispara\u00eetre l'obligation d'\u00e9lection en faveur de Conrad ou d'Anatole\u2014 il s'ensuivait que rien ne s'opposait donc \u00e0 ce qu'il put faire le moins, \u00e0 savoir: exercer son droit d'\u00e9lection en faveur de Conrad, en y attachant la condition ou restriction qu'il a ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son testament.\nEt, enfin, Joseph Lussier, fils, a tenu compte de l'intention des donateurs (exprim\u00e9s au moins quant \u00e0 l'un des terrains donn\u00e9s), que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartienne aux descendants portant le nom de Lussier\u2014ce qui ne pouvait s'appliquer qu'aux enfants m\u00e2les, puisqu'en contractant mariage les filles prennent le nom de leur mari et leurs enfants ne s'appelleraient pas Lussier.\nJoseph Lussier, fils, pouvait donc trouver dans la donation elle-m\u00eame, \u00e0 mon humble point de vue, toute justification pour faire son testament comme il l'a fait et l\u00e9guer \u00e0 Conrad la terre n\u00b0 199 avec la condition qu'il a ajout\u00e9e. Cette condition, \u00e0 l'effet que, si Conrad d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants m\u00e2les, la terre n\u00b0 199 retournerait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Anatole (ou inversement) n'est pas une charge; elle n'impose \u00e0 Conrad aucune obligation. S'il a des enfants m\u00e2les \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, elle l'autorise \u00e0 disposer de la terre n\u00b0 199 absolument comme il l'entendrait. Si aucun enfant m\u00e2le ne lui survit, par l'op\u00e9ration m\u00eame de la stipulation du testament, la terre va \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Anatole, ou, si ce dernier est alors d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les. Conrad lui-m\u00eame n'a rien \u00e0 y voir; toute la d\u00e9volution r\u00e9sulte des clauses m\u00eames du testament. Elle ne n\u00e9cessite aucun acte de la part de Conrad; ce n'est donc pas une charge, c'est tout simplement une restriction \u00e0 son droit de disposer absolument.\nOn ne peut donc \u00e9carter cette clause du testament de Joseph Lussier, fils, en se basant sur la th\u00e9orie que celui qui a le pouvoir d'\u00e9lection doit l'exercer purement et simplement et qu'il ne peut y superposer une charge quelconque.\nD'autre part, je ne vois pas pourquoi l'on ne saurait appliquer au cas qui nous occupe le principe que \"qui peut le plus peut le moins\". Or, indiscutablement, d'apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont le pouvoir d'\u00e9lection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Joseph Lussier, fils (\"comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement soit autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin\"), il aurait pu ne rien l\u00e9guer \u00e0 Conrad du bien qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re. Il pouvait exercer son pouvoir d'\u00e9lection en faveur d'un seul, comme bon lui semblait et suivant qu'il aviserait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il pouvait \u00e9lire Anatole seul, \"toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin\".\nEn fait, il a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 plus que cela \u00e0 Conrad. Au lieu de l'\u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement, il lui a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour lui-m\u00eame la terre n\u00b0 199, avec la seule restriction qu'il ne pourrait en disposer que si, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, il laissait des enfants m\u00e2les. C'\u00e9tait sans doute moins que s'il lui avait l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la terre sans restriction ; mais c'\u00e9tait plus que ce qu'il avait le droit de faire, \u00e0 savoir: ne pas la lui l\u00e9guer du tout. En tout respect, je cherche encore la r\u00e9ponse que l'on peut faire \u00e0 ce raisonnement. Mais l\u00e0 ne s'arr\u00eate pas l'objection que l'on peut trouver au jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel en l'esp\u00e8ce, et je suis d'accord avec les deux juges dissidents (Marchand et Surveyer, JJ.AA.).\nJoseph Lussier, fils, par son testament, a institu\u00e9 Conrad et Anatole ses l\u00e9gataires universels. Comme le dossier ne d\u00e9montre pas le contraire, ils doivent \u00eatre tenus pour avoir accept\u00e9, car \"la renonciation \u00e0 une succession ne se pr\u00e9sume pas; elle se fait par acte devant notaire ou par une d\u00e9claration judiciaire de laquelle il est don\u00e9 acte\" (C.C. 651). Et, bien naturellement, une pr\u00e9somption n'a pas besoin de preuve (C.C. 1239). Pour qu'elle soit repouss\u00e9e (et pourvu qu'il ne s'agisse pas d'une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure), il faut une preuve contraire.\nEn seule qualit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gataires universels, Conrad et Anatole sont les continuateurs de leur p\u00e8re, Joseph Lussier, fils, et ils sont tenus d'en acquitter toutes les charges et dettes (C.C. 735 et 875).\nIl s'ensuit que, m\u00eame si l'on devait consid\u00e9rer le legs de la terre n\u00b0 199 \u00e0 Conrad comme \u00e9tant affect\u00e9 d'une charge, celui-ci en serait quand m\u00eame tenu, en vertu du legs universel que lui a fait son p\u00e8re, dont il a accept\u00e9 la succession.\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, par cons\u00e9quent, la stipulation par laquelle la terre n\u00b0 199 est d\u00e9volue \u00e0 Conrad, qu'elle soit envisag\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection faite par son p\u00e8re par suite de la donation originaire, ou qu'elle soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'obligeant \u00e0 raison de sa qualit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gataire universel de son p\u00e8re, doit recevoir son application.\nIl faut donc d\u00e9cider que le testament par lequel il a voulu c\u00e9der la terre en question \u00e0 sa femme, en usufruit, \u00e0 ses filles, en propri\u00e9t\u00e9, allait \u00e0 l'encontre du titre m\u00eame d'o\u00f9 il tire son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son vivant. Ce titre \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 par une condition r\u00e9solutoire, c'est-\u00e0-dire, la condition qu'il eut des enfants m\u00e2les. Il n'en a pas eu, et, par l'effet de cette condition r\u00e9solutoire, la terre n\u00b0 199 retournait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Anatole.\nEn plus, comme l'a fait remarquer l'honorable Juge Surveyer, en l\u00e9guant l'usufruit de la terre \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, Conrad agissait directement et express\u00e9ment en violation de la d\u00e9fense qui se trouve contenue \u00e0 la fois dans la dona- tion originaire et dans le testament de Joseph Lussier, fils. Les biens originairement donn\u00e9s par les auteurs de Joseph Lussier, fils, puis l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par ce dernier, ne pouvaient en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 l'\u00e9pouse de Conrad \"de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit\".\nL'intim\u00e9e, Dame Laure Anna Tremblay, ne pouvait donc \u00e9mettre aucune pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'usufruit de la terre en question. Du point de vue pratique, cependant, il se peut que je doive me borner \u00e0 cette remarque, car, si ses filles, Fernande et Jovette, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9es dans l'action qu'elles ont intent\u00e9e, je suppose que, en ce qui concerne l'appelant, cette question serait demeur\u00e9e indiff\u00e9rente.\nD'accord avec les deux juges dissidents et avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je suis d'avis que la demande de l'appelant est bien fond\u00e9e; que le jugement qui l'a accueillie en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 et que, maintenant l'appel du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, celui de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nKerwin J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brothers Taschereau and Fauteux, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014Le 13 juillet 1905, Joseph Lussier, Sr, cultivateur de la paroisse de St-Philippe de Laprairie, et son \u00e9pouse commune en biens, Dame Ad\u00e9line Bonneau, ont fait donation entre vifs et irr\u00e9vocables \u00e0 leurs deux fils, Joseph Lussier, Jr, et Modeste Lussier, de certains biens d\u00e9taill\u00e9s comme suit:\nA Joseph:\na) Une somme de $1,000 payable dans trois ans;\nb) Un roulant de ferme;\nc) Une ferme mesurant environ 109 arpents, \u00e9tant le lot n\u00b0 198 du cadastre de la paroisse de St-Philippe ;\nd) Une autre ferme mesurant environ 96 arpents, \u00e9tant partie du lot n\u00b0 199 du m\u00eame cadastre.

A. Leblanc, notaire, le 20 novembre 1922, et est subs\u00e9quemment d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 28 ao\u00fbt 1924, sans l'avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9. Aux termes de ce testament, il a institu\u00e9 ses deux fils, Anatole et Conrad, ses l\u00e9gataires universels, en propri\u00e9t\u00e9; mais il leur a en outre l\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e0 titre 'particulier, les deux immeubles lui provenant de son p\u00e8re, savoir: \u00e0 Conrad, il a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la terre, \u00e9tant partie du lot n\u00b0 199 des plan et livres de renvoi officiels de la paroisse de St-Philippe, et \u00e0 Anatole, le demandeur dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la terre connue et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le n\u00b0 198 du m\u00eame cadastre.\nLes deux fermes ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es furent cependant l\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 Conrad et \u00e0 Anatole Lussier aux conditions suivantes :\n13\u00b0 Je veux et entends que les terrains ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 mes dits fils leur restent propres et n'entrent dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens d'entre eux et toutes \u00e9pouses avec qui ils pourront contracter mariage \u00e0 l'avenir, et qu'ils ne puissent non plus avantager leurs \u00e9pouses \u00e0 m\u00eame les dits terrains de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit;\n14\u00b0 Je veux et entends que si l'un ou l'autre de mes dits fils, Conrad1 ou Anatole vient \u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e9der \"ab intestat\" et laissant des enfants, les enfants m\u00e2les recueillent le terrain ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re, mais ils devront remettre une somme de quatre mille piastres courant aux filles, leurs s\u0153urs, s'il y en a; et si les dits Anatole ou Conrad Lussier d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans enfants m\u00e2les ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e8dent eux-m\u00eames avant leur majorit\u00e9 sans descendants, les dits terrains \u00e0 eux sus-l\u00e9gu\u00e9s ou ceux acquis en remploi, \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9dera ainsi, de m\u00eame que ces dits enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re col\u00e9gataire ou si ce dit fr\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les en remettant quatre mille piastres aux filles du d\u00e9funt, s'il y en a.

Par son testament olographe fait le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1943, il laissa, apr\u00e8s avoir fait quelques legs particuliers, le r\u00e9sidu de tous ses biens \u00e0 ses deux filles, et l'usufruit \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, Dame Laure Anna Tremblay.\nAnatole Lussier, l'appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, a alors pris action pour se faire d\u00e9clarer propri\u00e9taire de cette partie du lot n\u00b0 199 de la paroisse de St-Philippe de La-prairie, objet de la donation par Joseph Lussier, Sr, \u00e0 Joseph Lussier, Jr, et l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par ce dernier \u00e0 son fils Conrad. Pour se conformer aux termes du paragraphe 14 du testament, il a offert, avec son action, la somme de $4,000 aux deux filles, et l'action est dirig\u00e9e contre la d\u00e9fenderesse, Dame Laure Anna Tremblay, tant personnellement que comme tutrice \u00e0 ses deux filles mineures. Au cours de l'instance, Fernande est devenue majeure, et a repris l'instance en son nom personnel. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action, mais la Cour d'Appel 4 l'a rejet\u00e9e, MM. les Juges Marchand et Surveyer \u00e9tant dissidents. C'est la pr\u00e9tention du demandeur-appelant que l'acte de donation du 13 juillet 1905 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution, en vertu de laquelle le donataire Joseph Lussier \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 de substitution avec pouvoir sp\u00e9cial de choisir et de nommer un ou plusieurs appel\u00e9s parmi une certaine classe de personnes, et que ce choix pourrait \u00eatre conditionnel aussi bien que pur et simple. Il soutient que la nomination par Joseph Lussier, en vertu de son testament du 20 novembre 1922, de ses deux fils, Conrad et Anatole, l'appelant, comme grev\u00e9s de substitution, des deux fermes qu'il avait re\u00e7ues en vertu de l'acte de donation de son p\u00e8re et de sa m\u00e8re, (avec la r\u00e9serve que si un des fils d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants du sexe masculin, la ferme ainsi \u00e0 lui l\u00e9gu\u00e9e retournerait au fr\u00e8re) est un choix fait en vertu d'une condition r\u00e9solutoire, et \u00e9tait en stricte conformit\u00e9 avec l'acte de donation du 13 juillet 1905. Enfin et subsidiairement, l'appelant pr\u00e9tend que Conrad Lussier, ayant accept\u00e9 le legs universel fait \u00e0 lui par son p\u00e8re; a accept\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps les conditions attach\u00e9es au testament, y compris celle que la ferme substitu\u00e9e retournerait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Anatole, si lui, Conrad, d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants du sexe masculin.\nJe crois qu'il ne fait pas de doute que, malgr\u00e9 les termes employ\u00e9s dans l'acte de donation, \"Les donateurs n'entendent pas par l\u00e0 cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution\", il s'agit bien tout de m\u00eame d'une substitution. Les parties l'admettent, et si l'on s'est servi de ces termes, c'est probablement parce que les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution n'\u00e9taient pas individuellement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Il est certain aussi que le donateur ou le testateur qui veut cr\u00e9er une substitution, n'a pas l'obligation de d\u00e9signer d'une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise les appel\u00e9s, et qu'il soit loisible au grev\u00e9 qui est investi de ce pouvoir, de faire ce choix. Cette autorisation n'est pas sp\u00e9cifiquement donn\u00e9e dans le Code Civil, mais il n'est dit nulle part que le donateur ou le testateur ne peut pas d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ce pouvoir au grev\u00e9. Les auteurs le reconnaissent, mais ajoutent que quand ce droit est exerc\u00e9 par le grev\u00e9, ce dernier ne peut pas imposer de charges \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9. La raison est \u00e9vidente, et c'est que le grev\u00e9 ne dispose pas en faveur de la personne qu'il choisit, car cette derni\u00e8re est toujours cens\u00e9e recevoir de l'auteur de la substitution, de qui provient la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9. Ce choix peut se faire par quelque \u00e9crit que ce soit, et il peut m\u00eame se manifester dans un testament, par le legs particulier que le grev\u00e9 peut faire \u00e0 une personne d'un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le donateur ou le testateur originaire, des biens poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par le grev\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, et faisant l'objet de la substitution. Ce choix pourra m\u00eame \u00eatre contenu \"dans un legs universel fait par le grev\u00e9; mais ce legs universel ne vaudra comme legs que par rapport aux biens libres que le grev\u00e9 pouvait avoir d'ailleurs que de la substitution; par rapport \u00e0 ceux compris dans la substitution, il ne vaudrait que comme un acte renfermant le choix dont la facult\u00e9 lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par rapport aux dits biens\". Vide: (Pothier, Vol. 8, (Bugnet) Nos 81-82-83, page 482) (Th\u00e9venot D'Essaule, Trait\u00e9 des Substitutions, N\u00b0 1007) (Mignault, Vol. 5, page 144).\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, quand Joseph Lussier, Sr., a donn\u00e9 par acte de donation certaines terres \u00e0 son fils Joseph, Jr., et qu'il a dit que \"les biens provenant des donateurs devront rester au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers des donataires, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ces derniers\", et que \"si l'un ou l'autre des donataires d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient eux-m\u00eames avant leur majorit\u00e9 ou leur mariage, les immeubles pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9s \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9derait ainsi, de m\u00eame que ses enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son co-donataire ou \u00e0 ses enfants \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres\", et qu'enfin il ajoute que \"Les donateurs n'entendent pas par l\u00e0 cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution, et chacun des donataires aura le droit de faire entre ses enfants et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire, le partage des dits immeubles comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera\", il cr\u00e9ait une substitution dont son fils Joseph Lussier, Jr, \u00e9tait le grev\u00e9, et il lui laissait \u00e9videmment la facult\u00e9 de choisir qui devait d\u00e9finitivement recueillir les biens substitu\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d'appel\u00e9s.\nJoseph Lussier, Jr., a plus tard exerc\u00e9 cette facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lection; par son testament du 20 novembre 1922, il a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 les deux immeubles dont il avait joui \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, en sa qualit\u00e9 de grev\u00e9, attribuant \u00e0 Conrad la terre faisant partie du lot n\u00b0 199, et \u00e0 Anatole la terre connue et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le lot n\u00b0 198 du cadastre de la paroisse de St-Philippe. En faisant ces deux legs, comme l'enseigne la doctrine, il exer\u00e7ait bien le pouvoir de faire le choix des appel\u00e9s, que ses auteurs lui avaient conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'acte de donation de 1905.\nCependant, en l\u00e9guant ses deux terres, \u00e0 titre particulier, \u00e0 ses deux fils et en faisant ainsi le choix des appel\u00e9s, le testateur Joseph Lussier, Jr., s'exprime \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les termes suivants: \"Si les dits Conrad ou Anatole Lussier d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans enfants m\u00e2les\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. les dits terrains \u00e0 eux susl\u00e9gu\u00e9s\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. retourneront \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re co-l\u00e9gataire, ou si son fr\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les, en remettant $4,000 aux filles du d\u00e9funt, s'il y en a\". Et il ajoute ensuite par la clause 15 de son testament: \"Le but que j'ai en vue dans les dispositions de mes dits terrains a \u00e9t\u00e9 de conserver ces dits terrains \u00e0 une personne portant le nom de Lussier si possible\".\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu'en l\u00e9guant \u00e0 ses deux fils les biens substitu\u00e9s, Joseph Lussier, Jr., a exerc\u00e9 son droit d'\u00e9lection qui ne comportait pas d'autres pouvoirs que celui d'exercer un pur choix. Il avait charge de restituer \u00e0 des appel\u00e9s, et d\u00e8s cette restitution, les appel\u00e9s, Conrad et Anatole, pouvaient disposer absolument et d\u00e9finitivement des biens qu'ils \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s recevoir directement du substituant, et non du grev\u00e9. La charge impos\u00e9e par Joseph Lussier, Jr., \u00e0 son fils Conrad, que s'il d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants du sexe masculin, la ferme dont il jouissait comme grev\u00e9 \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, retournerait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, est une charge non pr\u00e9vue par l'acte organisant la substitution, et, en cons\u00e9quence elle serait nulle. Il s'ensuivrait que Conrad serait demeur\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement propri\u00e9taire, et que l'immeuble ne serait pas d\u00e9volu \u00e0 Anatole Lussier, le demandeur-appelant, \u00e0 cause de l'absence d'enfants du sexe masculin dans la famille de Conrad.\nJoseph Lussier, Jr., pouvait-il imposer cette restriction, ou, s'il choisissait de nommer son fils Conrad comme appel\u00e9, ne devait-il pas le nommer purement et simplement? Il est certain que la restriction concernant Conrad ne se trouve pas dans l'acte de donation de 1905. A cette date, une substitution fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e avec droit d'\u00e9lection, mais on ne trouve nulle part que Joseph Lussier, St., et sa femme aient manifest\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir que dans le cas o\u00f9 leurs arri\u00e8re petits-enfants, enfants de Anatole et Conrad, ne seraient pas du sexe masculin, les immeubles, objets de la substitution, devaient retourner \u00e0 l'autre co-donataire. Au contraire, la clause ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9\u2014elle se lit ainsi:\nSi l'un ou l'autre des donataires d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient eux-m\u00eames avant leur majorit\u00e9 ou leur mariage, les immeubles pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9s \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9derait ainsi, de m\u00eame que ses enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son co-donataire ou \u00e0 ses enfants \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres.\nIl semble donc que Conrad devenait le propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9finitif de l'immeuble qui lui \u00e9tait l\u00e9gu\u00e9, du moment qu'il avait une post\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement du sexe masculin. On a cru voir dans une autre clause de la donation, l'intention de l'auteur de la substitution, que les immeubles devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9finitivement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses fils, \u00e0 condition qu'ils eussent un enfant du sexe masculin. Cette clause se lit ainsi:\nLes donateurs stipulent sp\u00e9cialement que si le dit Modeste Lussier ne laissait pas de gar\u00e7on issu de mariage l\u00e9gitime, ou que ces gar\u00e7ons d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient en minorit\u00e9 et sans enfant m\u00e2le, le terrain ci-dessus d\u00e9crit comme partie du N\u00b0 50 du cadastre de St-Philippe retournera aux gar\u00e7ons du dit Joseph Lusiser, fils, l'intention des donateurs \u00e9tant que ce dernier terrain appartienne \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire du nom de Lussier, tant qu'il sera possible dans leur famille.\nCette clause de la donation originaire, comme on le voit, ne se rapporte qu'au lot n0 50, donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Modeste, fr\u00e8re de Joseph Lussier, Jr., et ne peut en cons\u00e9quence laisser supposer que la m\u00eame restriction doive s'appliquer aux autres immeubles affect\u00e9s par la substitution\u2014Indusio unius, exclusio alterius.\nCe litige est n\u00e9 du fait que Joseph Lussier, Jr., a conditionn\u00e9 le droit de Conrad comme appel\u00e9 d\u00e9finitif, \u00e0 la survivance d'enfants m\u00e2les \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et dont l'absence l'emp\u00eacherait d'\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9finitif avec droit de l\u00e9guer le lot n\u00b0 199 \u00e0 ses deux filles, comme il l'a fait. Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent que le grev\u00e9 Joseph Lussier, Jr., pouvait agir ainsi, car, d'apr\u00e8s eux, il n'aurait pas impos\u00e9 de charge \u00e0 Conrad, ce qu'il n'avait pas le droit de faire, mais il aurait simplement impos\u00e9 une condition, qui, si elle ne se r\u00e9alisait pas, annulait l'\u00e9lection faite par Joseph Lussier, Jr., avec effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la date de sa mort. Ceci signifierait que Conrad n'aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi comme appel\u00e9. On cite les articles 1079,1085 et 1088 du Code Civil, qui d\u00e9montrent en effet, que si une condition ne se r\u00e9alise pas, le contrat est r\u00e9solu avec effet r\u00e9troactif. On peut \u00e9videmment r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention que s'il est d\u00e9fendu au grev\u00e9, charg\u00e9 de faire une \u00e9lection, d'imposer une charge ou une obligation \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9, parce qu'il doit choisir ce dernier purement et simplement, il est difficile de justifier l'imposition d'une condition. On dit que Joseph Lussier, Jr., pouvait ne pas choisir Conrad, et que s'il le choisissait, il pouvait en cons\u00e9quence conditionner son choix. Mais le m\u00eame raisonnement s'applique \u00e0 l'imposition d'une charge ou d'une obligation, et pourtant tous les auteurs s'accordent \u00e0 dire qu'on ne peut l'imposer.\nMais il ne semble pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le grev\u00e9 ayant la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lection, peut imposer une condition \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive de l'appel\u00e9, car dans le cas qui nous occupe, je suis d'opinion que l'acte de donation de 1905, qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la substitution, ne permet pas au grev\u00e9 de subordonner ainsi le droit des appel\u00e9s \u00e0 une condition. L'acte de donation, en effet, stipule clairement que ceux qui seront appel\u00e9s le seront d\u00e9finitivement, s'ils ont des enfants quel que soit leur sexe. Comment alors Joseph Lussier, Jr., apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Conrad serait l'un des appel\u00e9s, pouvait-il lui dire que le choix serait r\u00e9solu, s'il mourait sans enfants m\u00e2les?\nDe plus, en faisant ce qu'il a fait, Joseph Lussier, Jr., ajoutait sans aucun doute un degr\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution. En effet, l'auteur de la substitution ne voulait \u00e9tablir qu'un seul grev\u00e9 avec pouvoir de choisir des appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs ayant des enfants du sexe masculin ou du sexe f\u00e9minin. En admettant la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant, il s'ensuit qu'il y aurait eu deux appel\u00e9s qui auraient successivement joui de l'immeuble, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taires, durant toute leur vie, viz: Joseph Lussier, Jr., et Conrad Lussier, et l'appelant, Anatole Lussier serait l'appel\u00e9 d\u00e9finitif. Ceci est \u00e9videmment contraire aux termes m\u00eames de l'acte de donation cr\u00e9ant la substitution. Ce serait cr\u00e9er substitution sur substitution, c'est-\u00e0-dire que par le d\u00e9sir du grev\u00e9, un autre grev\u00e9 apr\u00e8s lui, serait successivement ajout\u00e9, avant que l'immeuble ne devienne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive d'un nouvel appel\u00e9. La Loi ne permet pas de changer ainsi la volont\u00e9 d'un donateur ou d'un testateur. L'article 935 dit bien que l'auteur d'une substitution peut dans une nouvelle donation entre vifs, alors qu'il dispose de d'autres biens \u00e0 la m\u00eame personne, substituer les biens qu'il lui a donn\u00e9s purement et simplement dans la premi\u00e8re ; mais, cette substitution n'a d'effet que par l'acceptation de la disposition post\u00e9rieure dont elle est une condition, et sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits acquis aux tiers. Ceci signifie que lorsqu'un donateur donne purement et simplement des biens \u00e0 un de ses fils, il ne peut pas plus tard d\u00e9clarer que ce fils qui a accept\u00e9 devienne grev\u00e9, et nommer un appel\u00e9 pour recevoir d\u00e9finitivement. Le seul cas o\u00f9 la loi permet de substituer les biens ant\u00e9rieurement donn\u00e9s, est le cas o\u00f9 'le m\u00eame donateur fait une nouvelle donation, accept\u00e9e par le donataire, et dans laquelle il est stipul\u00e9 que les premiers biens sont affect\u00e9s d'une substitution. Cet article cependant n'autorise en aucune fa\u00e7on l'appel\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, de cr\u00e9er un nouveau degr\u00e9 comme on a tent\u00e9 de le faire dans le pr\u00e9sent cas. Il s'ensuit que Joseph Lussier, Jr., grev\u00e9 de la substitution de son p\u00e8re, ne pouvait pas, en choisissant son fils Conrad comme appel\u00e9, imposer la condition qu'il a stipul\u00e9e.\nMais, M. le Juge Marchand de la Cour d'Appel, qui \u00e9tait dissident, a fait un raisonnement diff\u00e9rent, et l'appelant l'a accept\u00e9 devant nous comme moyen subsidiaire. C'est, la pr\u00e9tention de M. le Juge Marchand que Joseph Lussier, Jr., a choisi et \u00e9lu ses deux fils Conrad et Anatole, non pas comme appel\u00e9s, mais comme des grev\u00e9s charg\u00e9s \u00e0 leur tour de rendre, en suivant certaines r\u00e8gles. Joseph Lussier, Jr., ne pouvait pas imposer \u00e0 ses fils cette substitution, mais il pouvait la leur proposer, et si ces derniers acceptaient, elle les liait comme toute autre convention. Joseph Lussier, Jr., ayant par son testament nomm\u00e9 ses deux fils ses l\u00e9gataires universels, non seulement des biens substitu\u00e9s par la donation mais de tous ses autres biens, ceux-ci ont en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 \"les continuateurs de la personnalit\u00e9 juridique de 'leur p\u00e8re, garants et responsables de l'ex\u00e9cution des volont\u00e9s exprim\u00e9es dans son testament\". En acceptant la succession globale, Conrad se trouvait par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 accepter la condition impos\u00e9e par son p\u00e8re Joseph Lussier, Jr., et \u00e0 sa mort, s'il n'avait pas d'enfants m\u00e2les, la terre portant le n\u00b0 199 devait retourner \u00e0 Anatole.\nIl est important de remarquer que, par son testament du 20 novembre 1922, Joseph Lussier, Jr, a divis\u00e9 ses biens en deux parts parfaitement distinctes. En premier lieu, il laisse, comme nous l'avons vu, la partie du lot 199 \u00e0 Conrad, et le lot n\u00b0 198 \u00e0 Anatole, qui sont les lots substitu\u00e9s venant de Joseph Lussier, Sr, par acte de donation. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait d'autres legs particuliers, il l\u00e8gue le r\u00e9sidu de tous ses biens tant meubles qu'immeubles, encore \u00e0 ses deux fils Conrad et Anatole, et enfin, ayant toujours en vue les lots 199 et 198, il fait les d\u00e9clarations contenues au paragraphe 14 de son testament, dans 'lequel se trouve la clause \u00e0 l'effet que, \"si les dits Conrad ou Anatole Lussier d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans enfants m\u00e2les............les dits terrains \u00e0 eux sus-l\u00e9gu\u00e9s (les lots 199 et 198) retourneront \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re co-l\u00e9gataire, ou si son fr\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les, en remettant $4,000 aux filles du d\u00e9funt\". Cette clause, \u00e9videmment, ne s'applique pas au r\u00e9sidu de la succession, mais purement et simplement aux lots substitu\u00e9s par la donation de l'a\u00efeul.\nIl \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, en effet, que Joseph Lussier, Jr, divis\u00e2t ainsi en deux les biens qu'il laissait \u00e0 ses fils Conrad et Anatole. Quand Joseph, Jr, dit qu'il donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Conrad le lot n\u00b0 199, et \u00e0 Anatole le lot n\u00b0 198, il n'emploie pas une expression exacte, car en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il n'y a ni don ni legs de ces deux lots. Le seul pouvoir de Joseph, Jr, \u00e9tait de d\u00e9signer Conrad et Anatole comme appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution, et comme devant d\u00e9finitivement \u00eatre propri\u00e9taires de ces deux lots. A l'ouverture de la succession de Joseph, Jr, Conrad et Anatole ont re\u00e7u chacun son lot, non pas de Joseph, Jr, mais bien de leur grand-p\u00e8re Joseph, Sr, et par cons\u00e9quent, ces deux lots ne faisaient nullement partie du patrimoine transmis \u00e0 ses fils par Joseph, Jr.\nJoseph, Jr, aurait pu de son vivant, par tout \u00e9crit quelconque, faire le choix des appel\u00e9s, et il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il le f\u00eet par testament. En le faisant de cette fa\u00e7on, il ne changeait cependant pas la nature de l'acte qu'il posait, qui demeure un choix pur et simple, ind\u00e9pendant des autres clauses du testament. C'est comme s'il y avait deux documents diff\u00e9rents, un choix et un testament. Comme le dit Pothier (Vol. 8, Bugnet, page 482):\nCe choix pourra m\u00eame \u00eatre contenu dans un legs universel fait par le grev\u00e9; mais ce legs universel ne vaudra comme legs que par rapport aux biens libres que le grev\u00e9 pouvait avoir d'ailleurs que de la substitution; par rapport \u00e0 ceux compris dans la substitution, il ne vaudrait que comme un acte renfermant le choix dont la facult\u00e9 lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par rapport aux dits biens. Je n'ai pas de doute que la condition eut \u00e9t\u00e9 nulle si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e dans un document diff\u00e9rent. Pourquoi penser qu'elle est l\u00e9gale et qu'elle lie Conrad parce qu'on la trouve dans le testament, quand on sait que le choix fait par le grev\u00e9, dans un acte de derni\u00e8re volont\u00e9 ou ailleurs, ne vaut que pour les biens de la substitution, et nullement quant \u00e0 ceux qui proviennent d'autres sources?\nIl me semble difficile de croire que Conrad, malgr\u00e9 qu'il fut h\u00e9ritier r\u00e9siduaire avec Anatole, ait accept\u00e9 cette condition, qui, si elle ne se r\u00e9alisait pas, le d\u00e9pouillait d'un bien qui lui provenait de son a\u00efeul. En prenant possession du lot n\u00b0 199, il recevait comme appel\u00e9 ce que son grand-p\u00e8re lui avait donn\u00e9, et cet acte isol\u00e9, n'ayant aucune relation avec les autres biens, ne peut pas laisser supposer qu'il ait accept\u00e9 conditionnellement l'ensemble de la succession. D'ailleurs, nous ne savons pas s'il a refus\u00e9 ou accept\u00e9 cette succession, et nous ignorons m\u00eame s'il y avait un r\u00e9sidu.\nMais, nous dit l'appelant, Joseph Lussier, Jr, pouvait, en vertu de dispositions de l'article 881 C.C., par son testament, l\u00e9guer conditionnellement \u00e0 Anatole la chose d'autrui, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'immeuble 199 dont Conrad \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitivement propri\u00e9taire comme appel\u00e9. L'article 881 C.C. se lit ainsi:\nLe legs que fait un testateur de ce qui ne lui appartient pas, soit qu'il conn\u00fbt ou non le droit d'autrui, est nul, m\u00eame lorsque la chose appartient \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier ou au l\u00e9gataire oblig\u00e9 au paiement.\nLe legs est cependant valide et \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la charge de procurer la chose ou d'en payer la valeur, s'il para\u00eet que telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention 'du testateur. Dans ce cas si la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e appartient \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier ou l\u00e9gataire oblig\u00e9 au paiement, soit que le fait f\u00fbt ou non connu du testateur, le l\u00e9gataire particulier est saisi de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son legs.\nOn voit donc, qu'en vertu du premier paragraphe de cet article, en principe, le legs de la chose d'autrui est nul. Que Joseph Lussier, Jr, ait su ou non que l'immeuble en question \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Conrad, le legs en faveur de Anatole est frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9. C'est l'application de la maxime bien connue Nemo plus juris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse haberet. Il n'y a qu'un seul cas o\u00f9 cette r\u00e8gle rigide puisse souffrir une exception, c'est lorsqu'il para\u00eet que l'intention du testateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 que l'h\u00e9ritier ou le l\u00e9gataire oblig\u00e9 au paiement soit tenu de se procurer la chose ou d'en payer la valeur. Dans ce cas, si la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e appartient \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier ou au l\u00e9gataire oblig\u00e9 au paiement, soit que le fait f\u00fbt ou non connu du testateur, le l\u00e9gataire particulier est alors saisi de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son legs. Mais, comme le dit Mignault (Vol. 4, page 369) : \"Toutefois, le seul fait que l'h\u00e9ritier ou le l\u00e9gataire serait propri\u00e9taire de la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, m\u00eame \u00e0 la connaissance du testateur, ne fera pas pr\u00e9sumer cette intention\". Dans le cas qui nous occupe, Conrad Lussier, h\u00e9ritier, est propri\u00e9taire de la chose, \u00e0 la connaissance du testateur, et il n'y a aucune intention manifeste de la part de ce dernier, qui nous permettrait d'appliquer l'exception pr\u00e9vue au second paragraphe de l'article 881 C.C.\nCe que je viens de dire supposerait qu'il s'agit d'un legs fait par Joseph Lussier, Jr, legs que le l\u00e9gislateur avait en vue quand il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 l'article 881 C.C. Je crois plut\u00f4t que ce sont les r\u00e8gles de la substitution qui doivent s'appliquer, et qui autrement seraient sans effet. Comme d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale la substitution du bien d'autrui est interdite par nos lois, sauf dans le cas de l'article 935 C.C. qui pr\u00e9voit un cas exceptionnel de substitution apr\u00e8s coup, par la m\u00eame personne, entre les m\u00eames parties, et portant sur une chose pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment donn\u00e9e par le m\u00eame donateur, il s'ensuit que la disposition faite par Joseph Lussier, Jr, est sans effet.\nLa conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9 me dispense de discuter les motifs invoqu\u00e9s par M. le Juge St-Jacques, qui \u00e9tait aussi d'avis de rejeter la pr\u00e9sente action.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'opinion que le jugement majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J. :\u2014Par acte de donation entre vifs, le 13 juillet 1905, Joseph Lussier et son \u00e9pouse, Adeline Bonneau, ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs fils, Joseph et Modeste, acceptant, les biens immobiliers suivants, tous du cadastre de la paroisse de St-Philippe:\nA Joseph, deux terres: l'une formant partie du lot 198, l'autre formant partie du lot 199, avec maison et autres b\u00e2tisses y construites ; A Modeste, trois terres : l'une situ\u00e9e en la C\u00f4te St-Claude, l'autre en la C\u00f4te St-Joseph et la derni\u00e8re\u2014faisant l'objet d'une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 laquelle il sera ci-apr\u00e8s r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9\u2014,en la concession St-Claude, formant partie du lot 50, avec maison et autres b\u00e2tisses y construites.\nCet acte de donation comporte particuli\u00e8rement que les biens donn\u00e9s doivent, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s des donataires, retourner au profit exclusif de leurs enfants. Les donateurs accordent cependant \u00e0 chacun des donataires \"le droit de faire entre ses enfants et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire, le partage des dits immeubles comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin.\"\nC'est par un testament en la forme authentique fait le 20 octobre 1922, et en lequel il instituait ses deux fils, Anatole et Conrad, ses l\u00e9gataires universels, que Joseph Lussier fils, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 28 ao\u00fbt 1924, exer\u00e7ait cette facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire en leur attribuant, dans la forme d'un legs particulier, respectivement la terre 198 et la terre 199. Dans chaque cas, la terre n'est pas donn\u00e9e purement et simplement, et en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais avec certaines prohibitions et, particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 la condition que si l'un des deux fils d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants m\u00e2les, la terre \u00e0 lui ainsi l\u00e9gu\u00e9e retournerait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, \u00e0 charge, par ce dernier, de remettre aux filles du premier, s'il en laissait, une somme de quatre mille dollars.\nEt voil\u00e0 bien l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 qui, s'\u00e9tant produite dans le cas de Conrad, a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige relativement \u00e0 la terre 199.\nEn fait, Conrad d\u00e9c\u00e9dait le 2 mai 1944 sans laisser d'enfants m\u00e2les. Il avait, cependant, par testament olographe fait le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1943 et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le 12 mai 1944, constitu\u00e9 sa femme et ses deux filles, h\u00e9riti\u00e8res de cette terre, respectivement en usufruit et en nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nC'est alors qu'Anatole Lussier, l'appelant, invoquant les dispositions du testament de son p\u00e8re, Joseph Lussier, fils, et 'le fait que son fr\u00e8re Conrad \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans laisser d'enfants m\u00e2les, a, par action p\u00e9titoire, r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la possession et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette terre formant partie du lot 199, apr\u00e8s avoir offert de verser aux filles de Conrad la somme de quatre mille dollars. En d\u00e9fense, les h\u00e9ritiers de Conrad, soit sa femme, Dame Laure-Anna Tremblay, l'intim\u00e9e, personnellement et en qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses filles mineures, Jovette et Fernande Lussier\u2014cette derni\u00e8re devenant \u00e0 sa majorit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e en reprise d'instance\u2014toujours demeur\u00e9es en possession de ces biens immobiliers, ont plaid\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement: Que Joseph Lussier fils ne pouvait, par son testament, accorder plus de droits \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers relativement \u00e0 cette terre qu'il n'en avait lui-m\u00eame en vertu de l'acte de donation ; que, suivant cet acte, les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution dont il \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 devenaient saisis de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble par le choix qu'il en avait fait en son testament et ce, depuis l'instant de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ; que la facult\u00e9 de partager le bien dont il \u00e9tait donataire n'incluait pas le droit d'imposer les prohibitions, conditions et charges apparaissant en son testament.\nAinsi appara\u00eet la question principale \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de cette cause: La facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire les appel\u00e9s donn\u00e9e en la donation comporte-t-elle le droit d'imposer les prohibitions, conditions et charges apparaissant au testament du grev\u00e9?\nA cette question, le savant Juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9pondu affirmativement. En somme, dit-il, l'imposition des prohibitions, conditions et charges ci-dessus constitue une modalit\u00e9 de choix conforme aux termes et \u00e0 l'esprit de la donation. Et l'action fut maintenue en cons\u00e9quence.\nEn appel 5, cette d\u00e9cision fut cass\u00e9e par un jugement majoritaire, MM, les Juges Barclay, Casey et St-Jacques, de la majorit\u00e9, et M. le Juge Marchand, de la minorit\u00e9,\u2014 M. le Juge Surveyer \u00e9tant le seul \u00e0 ne pas traiter de la question\u2014adopt\u00e8rent une vue oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 celle exprim\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance. Les deux premiers en font le ratio decidendi. M. le Juge St-Jacques maintient l'appel en s'appuyant sur un point subsidiaire dont la consid\u00e9ration ici devient non n\u00e9cessaire, vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en arrive sur le point principal. MM. les Juges Marchand et Surveyer, de la minorit\u00e9, renvoient l'appel; le premier d\u00e9cide que si Joseph Lussier fils ne pouvait pas imposer, par testament, une substitution \u00e0 ceux qu'il avait le droit d'appeler \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par son p\u00e8re, il pouvait quand m\u00eame la leur proposer comme condition du legs r\u00e9siduaire qu'il \u00e9tablissait en leur faveur, et, l'ayant accept\u00e9e, ils sont li\u00e9s comme par toute autre convention. Le second renvoie l'appel en disant que le testament de Conrad ne peut pr\u00e9valoir contre les dispositions de celui de son p\u00e8re, Joseph Lussier, Jr.\nIl faut, en premier lieu, r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'acte de donation et noter que les biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s aux donataires aux conditions suivantes, lesquelles sont num\u00e9rot\u00e9es pour fins de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences :\n1. Pour par les dits Donataires, leurs hoirs et ayant cause, jouir, user, faire et disposer des dits biens en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes et en prendre possession imm\u00e9diatement, sous les conditions et aux charges ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s.................\n2. Les pr\u00e9sentes sont consenties sous la condition expresse et sous peine de nullit\u00e9, que les biens pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9s devront rester propres \u00e0 chacun des Donataires et n'entrer dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens d'entre eux et leurs \u00e9pouses, et encore que les Donataires ne pourront en aucune mani\u00e8re avantager leurs \u00e9pouses \u00e0 m\u00eame les dits biens, soit par testament ou autrement, en plus de ce qui a pu leur \u00eatre assur\u00e9 par leur contrat de mariage respectif, les biens provenant des Donateurs devant rester au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers des Donataires, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ces derniers, nonobstant toute loi ou coutume contraires.\n3. Encore \u00e0 la condition que si l'un ou l'autre des Donataires d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient eux-m\u00eames, avant leur majorit\u00e9 ou leur mariage, les immeubles pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9s \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9derait ainsi, de m\u00eame que ses enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son co-donataire ou \u00e0 ses enfants \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres.\n4. Les Donateurs n'entendent pas par l\u00e0 cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution, et chacun des Donataires aura le droit de faire entre ses enfants et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire, le partage des dits immeubles comme bon lui semblera, soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul, suivant qu'il avisera, toute autorisation lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin.\n5. Et au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'un des dits Donataires, sans disposition de ses biens, ceux provenant des Donateurs seront partag\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre ses enfants ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants, \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire.\nJe ne puis douter que ces dispositions contiennent une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire. L'article 928 du Code Civil donne, entre autres, la r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation suivante:\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, c'est d'apr\u00e8s l'ensemble de l'acte et l'intention qui s'y trouve suffisamment manifest\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que d'apr\u00e8s l'acceptation ordinaire de certaines expressions, qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il y a ou non substitution.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, et nonobstant les expressions employ\u00e9es au d\u00e9but de la clause 4: \"Les Donateurs n'entendent pas cr\u00e9er une vraie substitution......\"\u2014lesquelles s'expliquent par la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire qui y est imm\u00e9diatement exprim\u00e9e\u2014, les dispositions ci-dessus \u00e9tablissent manifestement que la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie \"sous la condition expresse et sous peine de nullit\u00e9\" que les biens provenant des donateurs doivent \"rester au profit exclusif des h\u00e9ritiers des Donataires, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ces derniers, nonobstant toute loi ou coutume contraires\". Chacun des donataires est donc ainsi charg\u00e9 de rendre \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ce qu'il re\u00e7oit par l'acte de donation. Et c'est l\u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire (art. 925). Ainsi en a conclu la Cour d'Appel et les parties admettent en leurs factums le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision sur ce point fondamental. Ces vues, peut-\u00eatre est-il utile d'ajouter, ne peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9es du fait de la pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 l'acte d'une clause, non cit\u00e9e ici, accordant aux donataires une libert\u00e9 limit\u00e9e d'ali\u00e9ner (vente ou \u00e9change entre eux). Ni en droit, ni en fait, cette clause n'a ici de port\u00e9e. L'article 952 prescrit que \"le substituant peut ind\u00e9finiment permettre l'ali\u00e9nation des biens substitu\u00e9s; la substitution n'a d'effet, en ce cas, que si l'ali\u00e9nation n'a pas eu lieu\".\nIl est \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel et admis aux factums des parties que, nonobstant le silence du Code sur le sujet, il est loisible \u00e0 celui qui dispose de ses biens par acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 d'accorder\u2014ainsi qu'on l'a fait en la clause 4\u2014aux donataires charg\u00e9s de substitution, la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire le ou les appel\u00e9s parmi ceux qui y sont indiqu\u00e9s. C'est la doctrine expos\u00e9e aux \u0153uvres de Pothier (Bugnet), Vol. 8, p. 481, nos 80 et suivants, au Trait\u00e9 des Substitutions Fid\u00e9icommissaires, de Th\u00e9venot d'Essaule, pp. 317 et suivantes, et dans Migneault, Vol. 5, p. 144.\nDans le cas de Joseph Lussier fils, cette facult\u00e9, tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e par testament. Il convient d'en citer les clauses pertinentes au d\u00e9bat:\n5\u00b0 Je donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Conrad Lussier, l'un de mes fils, une terre..... formant partie du lot 199......\n6\u00b0 Je donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Anatole Lussier, un autre de mes fils, une terre...... formant partie du lot 198......\n12\u00b0 Je donne et l\u00e8gue le r\u00e9sidu de tous mes biens tant meubles qu'immeubles que je d\u00e9laisserai lors de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 mes deux dits fils, Conrad et Anatole Lussier, en parts \u00e9gales, que je fais et institue pour mes l\u00e9gataires g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et universels en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s sous les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es;\n13\u00b0 Je veux et entends que les terrains ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 mes dits fils leur restent propres et n'entrent dans aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens d'entre eux et toutes \u00e9pouses avec qui ils pourront contracter mariage \u00e0 l'avenir, et qu'ils ne puissent non plus avantager leurs \u00e9pouses \u00e0 m\u00eame les dits terrains de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit; 14\u00b0 Je veux et entends que si l'uni ou l'autre de mes dits fils, Conrad ou Anatole vient \u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e9der \"ab intestat\" et laissant des enfants, les enfants m\u00e2les recueillent le terrain ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re, mais ils devront remettre une somme de quatre mille piastres courant aux filles, leurs s\u0153urs, s'il y en a; et si les dits Anatole ou Conrad Lussier d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans enfants m\u00e2les ou que ces enfants d\u00e9c\u00e8dent eux-m\u00eames avant leur majorit\u00e9 sans descendants, les dits terrains \u00e0 eux sus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s ou ceux acquis en remploi, \u00e0 celui qui d\u00e9c\u00e9dera ainsi, de m\u00eame que ces dits enfants comme susdit, retourneront \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re co-l\u00e9gataire ou si ce dit fr\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants m\u00e2les en remettant quatre mille piastres aux filles du d\u00e9funt, s'il y en a. Cependant, mes dits fils pourront et devront faire entre leurs enfants m\u00e2les ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants m\u00e2les au survivant des dits Conrad ou Anatole Lussier, le partage des dits terrains comme bon leur semblera, mais en ce cas si le dit d\u00e9funt des dits Conrad ou Anatole Lussier laisse des filles issues de son mariage, les enfants m\u00e2les qui h\u00e9riteront des dits terrains devront une somme de quatre mille piastres courant aux filles du d\u00e9funt, Anatole ou Conrad Lussier.\n15\u00b0 Je veux et ordonne que mes dits fils ne puissent hypoth\u00e9quer mes dits terrains seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 ils se vendront l'un \u00e0 l'autre, alors celui qui ach\u00e8tera le terrain de son fr\u00e8re pourra hypoth\u00e9quer son terrain pour une somme de quatre mille piastres courant aux fins de donner des garanties \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re ou de faire un emprunt d'un \u00e9tranger pour payer son dit fr\u00e8re. Et quand ils vendront les dits terrains, le prix en provenant devra \u00eatre employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'achat d'autres terrains qui seront soumis aux m\u00eames r\u00e9serves que ceux que je leur l\u00e8gue pr\u00e9sentement;\nLe but que j'ai en vue dans la disposition de mes dits terarins a \u00e9t\u00e9 de conserver ces dits terrains \u00e0 une personne portant le nom de Lussier autant que possible.\nAinsi appara\u00eet-il, des dispositions de son testament, que Joseph Lussier fils a, sans distinction aucune, trait\u00e9 les biens substitu\u00e9s au m\u00eame titre que ses propres, tout comme si l'acte de donation l'en avait constitu\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire absolu: Il a pr\u00e9tendu les donner et les l\u00e9guer; il les a affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des prohibitions et des restrictions; il les a lui-m\u00eame grev\u00e9s d'une nouvelle substitution en chargeant ses fils Conrad et Anatole, petits-enfants des donateurs, de les rendre \u00e0 d'autres. Pareilles dispositions, aussi bien que l'intention les inspirant,\u2014intention r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de la clause 15\u2014, ne laissent aucun doute que Joseph Lussier fils a trait\u00e9 tous ces biens, sans distinction, comme si c'\u00e9tait les siens.\nQu'il ait eu ce droit quant aux biens libres de la substitution, ses propres, la question ne se pose pas.\nMais pouvait-il ce faire quant aux biens substitu\u00e9s qu'il avait re\u00e7us par la donation dont il avait accept\u00e9 les termes, je ne le crois pas. Sans la pr\u00e9sence de cette clause de facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire et de partager, il est certain qu'il ne le pouvait pas. L'intention des donateurs manifeste trop clairement que ce sont les enfants des donataires qui sont les appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs. Aussi bien, dans cette alternative, chaque enfant du donataire, en qualit\u00e9 d'appel\u00e9, et dans les termes m\u00eames de l'article 962, \"re\u00e7oit les biens directement du substituant et non du grev\u00e9. L'appel\u00e9 est, par l'ouverture de la substitution \u00e0 son profit, saisi de suite de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que tout autre l\u00e9gataire; il peut en disposer absolument et il les transmet dans sa succession, s'il n'y a prohibition ou substitution ult\u00e9rieure\". L'acte de donation ne comporte pas de prohibition ou de substitution ult\u00e9rieure applicable en l'esp\u00e8ce, quant \u00e0 la terre 199. Mais il en comporte, relativement \u00e0 la terre 50.\nLa pr\u00e9sence de la clause de facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire et de partager modifie-t-elle, en principe, cette conclusion? Les auteurs s'accordent \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre dans la n\u00e9gative et la raison qu'ils en donnent est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le principe sanctionn\u00e9 dans notre loi par l'article 962. Pothier, Vol. 8 (Bugnet), p. 482:\nLa diff\u00e9rence entre la substitution et la facult\u00e9 de choix, et celle par laquelle on substitue simplement la famille, est que, lorsque le grev\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence de la facult\u00e9 de choisir qui lui-est accord\u00e9e, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son choix en faveur de quelqu'un de la famille, la substitution ne sera ouverte par son d\u00e9c\u00e8s qu'au profit de celui ou ceux qu'il aura choisis, au lieu que, si on e\u00fbt simplement substitu\u00e9 la famille, sans accorder ce choix, la substitution aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte au profit de tous ceux de la famille qui se seraient trouv\u00e9s les plus proches parents du grev\u00e9, lors de l'ouverture.\nLe choix que le grev\u00e9 fait selon la facult\u00e9 qui lui est accord\u00e9e, d'une personne de la famille, n'est point une disposition qu'il fasse envers cette personne qu'il choisit; c'est un pur choix; c'est pourquoi la personne qu'il a choisie, qui en vertu de ce choix recueille la substitution, n'est point du tout cens\u00e9e tenir les biens compris en la substitution de celui qui l'a choisie; mais elle est cens\u00e9e les tenir de l'auteur de la substitution.\nC'est pourquoi le grev\u00e9 qui a fait ce choix, ne peut pas, pour raison de ce seul choix, imposer aucune charge \u00e0 la personne qu'il a choisie; car, en la choisissant, il n'a proprement exerc\u00e9 aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers elle, il ne lui a donn\u00e9 rien du sien. Non enim facultas necessare electionis, propriae liberalitatis beneficium est: quid est enim quod de se videatur deliquisse qui quod relinquit omnimodo reddere debuit? L. 67 S. 1er, ff. de Leg. 2.\nCe choix n'\u00e9tant point une disposition que le grev\u00e9 fasse de ses biens envers la personne qu'il a choisie, il peut le faire par quelque acte que ce soit, pourvu1 que ce soit par \u00e9crit. Th\u00e9venot d'Essaule, Traite des Substitutions, N\u00b0 1013, p. 319:\nLe grev\u00e9, en-\u00e9lisant, n'est point cens\u00e9 exercer une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers celui qu'il choisit. Il ne peut par cons\u00e9quent le soumettre \u00e0 aucune charge de substitution, ni autre quelconque.\nRicard, Des Donations, Vol. 2, p. 448 :\nC'est pourquoi le grev\u00e9 qui a fait ce choix, ne peut pas, pour raison de ce seul choix, imposer aucune charge \u00e0 la personne qu'il a choisie: car, en la choisissant, il m'a proprement exerc\u00e9 aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers elle, il ne lui a donn\u00e9 rien du sien.\nMignault, Vol. 5, p. 145:\nLe choix fait par le grev\u00e9 ne constitue pas une disposition en faveur de la personne choisie; c'est un pur choix et la personne choisie tiendra les biens du substituant et non pas du grev\u00e9. Ce dernier ne peut donc \u00e0 raison de ce seul choix, imposer aucune charge \u00e0 la personne qu'il a choisie, car il n'exerce envers elle aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9.\nPeut-on trouver dans l'acte de donation de 1905, et relativement \u00e0 la terre 199 en particulier, une intention expresse ou implicite des donateurs d'accorder aux donataires, en leur donnant la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire et de partager, le droit de ne pas rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9lu la terre purement et simplement, en pleine et absolue propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et tout comme si ce dernier la recevait des donateurs eux-m\u00eames?\nNotons bien que si les donateurs ont accord\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun des donataires \"le droit de faire entre ses enfants et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants \u00e0 ceux de son fr\u00e8re co-donataire, le partage des dits immeubles comme bon lui semblera\",\u2014discr\u00e9tion n\u00e9cessairement qualifi\u00e9e et restreinte par les mots qui suivent \"soit \u00e9galement ou autrement, et m\u00eame \u00e0 un seul\"\u2014, ils ne leur en ont pas fait une obligation. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ils ont, par la clause imm\u00e9diatement suivante (5), prescrit qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de tel partage\u2014les donataires pouvant juger \u00e0 propos de ne pas le faire\u2014, les biens substitu\u00e9s se partageront \u00e9galement entre les enfants.\nDans tous les cas, le droit accord\u00e9 vise le partage des biens de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale ou in\u00e9gale, au profit de tous, de quelques-uns, ou m\u00eame d'un seul des enfants des donataires. Il faut bien noter que si chaque donataire avait le droit d'exclure un ou plusieurs de ses enfants, il ne pouvait pas tous les exclure. De sorte que, assumant que l'un des donataires n'e\u00fbt eu qu'un seul enfant, un gar\u00e7on ou une fille, peu importe,\u2014les donateurs n'ont pas fait de distinction de sexe et ceci est d'ailleurs immat\u00e9riel au pr\u00e9sent raisonnement\u2014il n'y aurait pas eu lieu \u00e0 partage ou \u00e0 \u00e9lection. La clause 4 serait alors sans effet et, par le jeu exclusif de la clause 2 pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, cet enfant unique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re, comme propri\u00e9taire absolu de tous les biens donn\u00e9s, tout comme si la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire et de partager e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 absente de l'acte de donation. En pareil cas, il devient manifeste qu'aucune restriction, prohibition ou substitution, n'aurait pu \u00eatre impos\u00e9e par le donataire. Il faut tenir ce r\u00e9sultat comme manifestant, en telle occurrence, l'intention v\u00e9ritable des donateurs de donner \u00e0 cet enfant, ainsi alors \u00e9lu par eux-m\u00eames, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue de tous les biens substitu\u00e9s.\nJe ne puis voir dans l'\u00e9tablissement de cette facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire et de partager, l'intention des donateurs d'accorder aux donataires le droit de contr\u00f4ler, par l'\u00e9tablissement de restrictions, prohibitions, ou par la cr\u00e9ation de nouvelles substitutions, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appel\u00e9, que ce soit l'appel\u00e9 choisi par les donateurs eux-m\u00eames dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e alors que la clause 4 est inop\u00e9rante, ou que ce soit le ou les appel\u00e9s, encore choisis par les donateurs eux-m\u00eames, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la clause 5, ou que ce soit l'appel\u00e9 ou les appel\u00e9s choisis par les donataires dans le cas o\u00f9 ils peuvent se pr\u00e9valoir et, de fait, se pr\u00e9valent de la facult\u00e9 \u00e0 eux accord\u00e9e. Nulle part appara\u00eet \u00e0 l'acte d'intention de traiter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'enfant, ou des enfants appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution par le choix des donataires, diff\u00e9remment de celle de l'enfant, ou des enfants qui y sont appel\u00e9s par le jeu exclusif des clauses de la donation.\nDans tous les cas, par le simple appel au partage, les dispositions de l'acte sont satisfaites et si cet appel est fait par les donataires, en vertu du mandat qu'il leur est loisible d'exercer, ce mandat en est, par le fait m\u00eame, \u00e9puis\u00e9.\nLa stipulation particuli\u00e8re, relative au lot 50, donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Modeste Lussier, loin d'aider la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant, illustre bien la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle les donateurs entendent faire exception. Elle se lit comme suit :\nLes donateurs stipulent sp\u00e9cialement que si le dit M. Modeste Lussier ne laissait pas de gar\u00e7ons issus de mariage l\u00e9gitime, ou que ces gar\u00e7ons d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient en minorit\u00e9 et sans enfants m\u00e2les, le terrain ci-dessus d\u00e9crit comme partie du lot num\u00e9ro 50 du cadastre de St-Philippe retournera aux gar\u00e7ons dudit Joseph Lussier fils, l'intention des donateurs \u00e9tant que ce dernier terrain appartienne \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire du nom de Lussier tant qu'il sera possible dans leur famille. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dois ajouter, en conclusion, qu'on ne solutionne pas le probl\u00e8me avec le truisme: \"Qui peut le plus, peut le moins\", auquel on peut r\u00e9pondre comme l'a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e: \"Qui peut le moins, ne peut le plus\". La v\u00e9ritable question est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de savoir si celui qui a la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire \"peut le plus\". A cette question,\u2014tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9\u2014, la doctrine r\u00e9pond dans la n\u00e9gative et rien dans l'acte ne sugg\u00e8re que les donateurs ont entendu y d\u00e9roger.\nMais, dit M. le Juge Marchand, s'il est vrai que Joseph Lussier, fils, ne pouvait pas imposer, \u00e0 ceux qu'il choisissait comme appel\u00e9s, des restrictions, prohibitions ou charges relatives aux biens substitu\u00e9s, il pouvait les leur proposer et c'est ce qu'il aurait fait en leur l\u00e9guant le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens \u00e0 la condition qu'ils acceptent ces prohibitions, restrictions et charges, sur les biens substitu\u00e9s qu'ils recevaient. De sorte qu'en acceptant ce legs r\u00e9siduaire, conclut-il, ils acceptaient, par le fait m\u00eame, la proposition et devenaient li\u00e9s comme dans un contrat.\nVainement ai-je fouill\u00e9 les plaidoiries \u00e9crites pour y d\u00e9celer cette proposition de droit ou les all\u00e9gations de faits sur lesquelles elle doit reposer. Il n'appara\u00eet pas davantage que ce point, sur lequel le savant Juge de la Cour d'Appel d\u00e9cide du litige, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement soumis \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance. Et il semble, au surplus, que si cette proposition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e devant la Cour d'Appel, les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 y auraient r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 dans leurs raisons de jugement.\nA cela, on peut ajouter que le point soulev\u00e9 sugg\u00e8re les questions suivantes: Joseph Lussier, fils, a-t-il, en fait, laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, dans son patrimoine, des biens r\u00e9siduaires? Dans l'affirmative, Conrad Lussier a-t-il accept\u00e9 ce legs r\u00e9siduaire pour sa part? S'il l'a accept\u00e9, a-t-il fait cette acceptation \u00e8s qualit\u00e9s d'h\u00e9ritier testamentaire et en consid\u00e9ration de cette \"proposition\" apparaissant dans le testament de son p\u00e8re sous la forme d'une imposition non permise, ou simplement \u00e8s qualit\u00e9s d'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gal. Le dossier ne l'indique pas. Assumant que le point soulev\u00e9 par M. le Juge Marchand serait bien fond\u00e9 en droit, on ne saurait l'utiliser \u00e0 la disposition de cette cause sans joindre, \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration d'une proposition qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e, la sp\u00e9culation sur des faits qui ne sont ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, ni prouv\u00e9s. Aussi bien, je crois qu'il y a lieu d'appliquer ici la r\u00e8gle reconnue par cette Cour dans The Century Indemnity Company v. Rogers 6; Sullivan v. McGillis and others 7; et, tout r\u00e9cemment encore, City of Verdun v. Sun Oil Company 8, voulant, en principe, que les parties sont li\u00e9es par les positions qu'elles ont prises et soutenues dans la conduite de leur cause.\nJe rejetterais l'appel, avec d\u00e9pens des trois Cours.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Beaulieu, Gouin, Bourdon, Beaulieu and Casgrain.\nSolicitors for the Respondents: Monette, Filion, Meighen and, Gourd.\n1 Q.R.

E. Viau. This Court's jurisdiction is defined by the Supreme Court Act and, as the request for a writ of prohibition was made in 1948, we must refer for our powers to that Act as it stood before the 1949 amendment: Boyer v. The King 2, where the earlier cases are considered. The decision in Boyer was approved by all the members of this Court: see Marcotte v. The King 3. By section 36 of that Act, as it then stood, there is excepted from our jurisdiction any proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition arising out of a criminal charge. The word \"criminal\" in the section and in the context in question is used in contradistinction to \"civil\" and connotes a proceeding which is not civil in its character: Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd. 4, affirming (1921) 62 S.C.R. 118. This was a case of certiorari arising out of a prosecution under the Alberta Liquor Act but Mitchell v. Tracey 5, a case of prohibition arising out of a prosecution under the Nova Scotia Temperance Act was approved. Here, the application for the writ of prohibition arose out of a charge against the respondent of aiding the commission, by another, of the offence of personation contrary to article 302 of the Cities and Towns Act R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233. This appeal, therefore, falls within the exception in section 36 of the Supreme Court Act and it must be quashed with costs as of a motion to quash. The respondent is also entitled to its costs of the application for leave to appeal to this Court made to the Court of King's Bench, which by the latter's order, were to follow the event.\nThe appellant served a notice of motion for special leave to appeal under new section 41 of the Supreme Court Act as enacted by the amending Act of 1949. For the reasons already given, the new section does not apply and that application must be dismissed with costs.\nIt should be added that the leave given by the Court of King's Bench does not avail the appellant as the right to grant leave, conferred on that Court by section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, is confined to \"any case within section thirty-six i.e. except (inter alia) any proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition arising out of a criminal charge: Canadian International Paper v.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1951: November 22, 23; 1952: February 5.\nPresent: Kerwin, Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPrincipal and agent\u2014Principal to pay commission on purchases effected by agent on its behalf subject to terms of written agreement\u2014Agent having fulfilled the terms, principal refused to complete purchase\u2014Measure of Damages.\nUnder a written agreement the respondent undertook to pay the appellant a ten per cent commission on ignition transformers to be purchased by the appellant and laid down in Canada at a price not to exceed $15, and by a further document authorized the appellant to act as its representative in the purchase of transformers. The appellant, as representative of the respondent, entered into an agreement with an English firm for the purchase of 20,000 transformers at a price of \u00a32.5.0d, ten per cent of the purchase price to be paid with the official order. The respondent ultimately refused to proceed with the purchase. In an action brought by the appellant for payment of commission.\nHeld: An agreement to purchase implies a covenant to pay the purchase price. Grieve McClory Ltd. v. Dome Lumber Co. [1923] 2 D.L.R. 154 at 164; Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Gribble [1913] 3 K.B. 212. Where as here, the express agreement to buy is followed only by \u201cterms of payment\u201d including a first payment of ten per cent with \u201cofficial order\u201d and no time is fixed, the law implies a reasonable time but not a condition that it will not be fulfilled except at the buyer\u2019s option, therefore the appellant brought about a binding contract of purchase and sale. Since the appellant did all he agreed to do, and the conduct of the respondent was the cause of there being no deliveries, the former was entitled to damages in the amount he would otherwise have been paid as commission. Whyte v. National Paper Co. 51 Can. S.C.R., followed, Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Cooper [1941] A.C. 108, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Ferguson J.[2] dismissing the action.\nR.A. McMurtry K.C. and D.A. Keith for the appellant. It must be conceded that the appellant earned his commission and is entitled to judgment if he completed a binding contract with the Runbaken Co. with respect to the sale and purchase of 20,000 transformers. It is submitted that the contract entered into by the appellant on Jan. 29, 1947 with the Runbaken Co. is a binding executory contract between the respondent and the Runbaken Co. The trial judge erred in holding that the said contract was not effective or binding unless and until the respondent should sign a further document referred to as an \u201cofficial order\u201d. He erred and misdirected himself on the evidence when he purported to make the said finding on the following grounds:\n(a) That the only evidence of what was meant by \u201cofficial order\u201d was that given by Lome, the president of the respondent company.\n(b) That such a finding was in accordance with the interpretation put on the contract by the appellant himself in his letter to the respondent (Exhibit 9) and subsequent correspondence and\n(c) On the wording of the agreement itself.\nThe above grounds on which the trial judge based his findings are not valid for the following reasons:\n1. As to (a)\u2014Both the appellant and Lome gave evidence which was entirely inconsistent with the finding of the trial judge as to the meaning of the term \u201cofficial order\u201d.\n2. As to (b)\u2014The appellant considered that he had effected a binding contract and this is borne out by the correspondence in the light of the evidence adduced.\n3. As to (c)\u2014The agreement itself is not fairly open to the interpretation adopted by the trial judge. The term \u201cofficial order\u201d as used in the contract was only referable to an administrative act on the part of the respondent company which it was bound to perform in order to fix the time for delivery under the contract and the instalments of payments. It is obvious that from the inception of this action down to a few days before the trial the defendant company itself considered that the plaintiff had effected a binding contract with the Runbaken Co. to the extent of entitling him to the payment of his commission. It is significant that the original Statement of Defence raised no real issue or suggestion that the plaintiff had not earned his commission but relied solely on a plea of accord and satisfaction. On the basis of the reasoning of the trial judge the interpretation placed on this contract by the defendant in its original Statement of Defence may be of some importance in determining the state of mind of the parties, with respect to the contract and its true meaning. Even in its amended Statement of Defence the defendant continued to plead (and not expressed as an alternative plea) that the plaintiff and defendant agreed to a full settlement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for commission upon payment by the defendant to the plaintiff of the further sum of $2,020. That the defendant paid the said sum and the same was accepted in full satisfaction of all claims against the defendant in respect of commissions. Although a great deal of evidence was tendered by the defendant in support of the above allegations, the trial judge rejected the evidence in toto on this point and accepted the plaintiff\u2019s version. The trial judge purports to hold that the contract was not a binding contract solely by reason of there being no \u201cofficial order\u201d signed by the defendant company. It is difficult to understand the validity of this reasoning in view of the fact, on the basis of the trial judge\u2019s express finding, that the plaintiff had full authority to bind the defendant company with respect to the purchase in question so that all the plaintiff had to do was to sign such an order himself, if he deemed it in any way necessary. It is well settled law that an agent is entitled to payment of his commission by his principal once he has fulfilled his obligation by effecting a binding agreement between his principal and a third party. This vested right of the agent to his commission can not be destroyed by reason of any act or default on the part of the principal or the third party. Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. Cooper[3] per Lord Russell at 41, 46; Marshall v. Canada Corn Products[4]; Whyte v. National Paper[5]; Whiteside v. Wallace Shipyards[6].\nJ.J. Robinette K.C. and B. Grossberg K.C. for the respondent. The claim of the plaintiff as set out in the Statement, of Claim is for \u201ccommissions earned\u201d. There is no claim on quantum meruit or for damages nor could either of such claims be sustained in law. Davis v. Trollope[7]. Under the terms of exhibit 1 (Letter from the respondent company to the appellant dated Nov. 28, 1946) the events which must happen before the plaintiff could recover commissions are (a) a purchase; the transformers must be laid down in Canada; the laid down price in Canada must not be in excess of $15; a purchase by the plaintiff himself. There never was a purchase. It is submitted purchase means a legally binding and completed contract of purchase and sale. Exhibit 3 (agreement between respondent and Runbaken Electrical Products signed by appellant) was simply an offer or proposal which required acceptance as therein set out, namely by an official order and a deposit. Before there could be a legal contract there was required an official order from the defendant and a deposit of \u00a31,150 from the defendant.\nNo commission was payable because no transformers were laid down in Canada. This is admitted. Exhibit 3 indicates that the prices were to be reviewed every three months. One could not calculate the commissions until delivery was made. It cannot be said the price would never exceed $15. It is submitted that the words \u201cpurchased by yourself\u201d means the plaintiff was to purchase on his own behalf and ship the transformers to Canada. The defendant could not enforce exhibit 3 against Runbaken nor could Runbaken enforce it against the defendant, nor was any effort made by Runbaken to maintain there was a contract of purchase and sale. The amount involved in Exhibit 3 was approximately $150,000 and it cannot be reasonably said that the plaintiff could bind the defendant for such an amount without the defendant having an opportunity to give its \u201cofficial order\u201d. Runbaken must have realized this when it asked for an \u201cofficial order\u201d and a deposit.\nThere being no completed or legally binding contract of purchase and sale and no transformers having been \u201claid down\u201d in Canada, the plaintiff cannot recover.

Dealing with the alternative defence that a settlement was made, the plaintiff contends that the Runbaken matter was not mentioned when he visited Lome in Toronto in July 1947. It is submitted that such contention is unreasonable and ought not to be accepted. The trial judge made no express finding that he disbelieved Lome or Brooker with respect to the settlement and having found that the words \u201cpayment in full re commissions\u201d were on the cheque when it was received by the plaintiff and the plaintiff having signed underneath these words and cashed the cheque, the plaintiff is bound thereby. The evidence of Brooker corroborated that of Lome and the trial judge did not give proper effect to the endorsement on the cheque and should have held that the plaintiff was bound thereby.\nMCMURTRY K.C. replied. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The parties to this appeal entered into an agreement on the 28th of November, 1946, as follows:\nIt is hereby agreed that you (the appellant) are to receive a 10 per cent commission on ignition transformers purchased by yourself and laid down in Canada at a price not in excess of $15 and a 10 per cent commission on motors purchased by yourself at a price laid down in Canada not in excess of $20.\nAt the same time, the respondent executed and gave to the appellant the following document:\nTORONTO 1, CANADA.\nNovember 28, 1951.\nTo Whom It May Concern\nGreetings:\nThis is to certify that Mr. J.J. Bonnie, whose signature appears hereon, is hereby authorized to act as our representative in the purchase of oil burner ignition transformers, motors and copper wire.\nThe appellant was proceeding to England where the purchases mentioned a bove were to be made. Following a telephone conversation on January 24, 1947, between the appellant, then in England, and one Lome, president of the respondent, in Canada, the appellant, on behalf of the respondent, entered into an agreement in writing on the 29th of January, 1947, with an English firm, Runbaken Electrical Products, for the purchase of 20,000 transformers. The following terms of that agreement are of importance:\nMessrs. Aero Tool Works as represented by Mr. J.J. Bonnie, agrees to purchase 20,000 Transformers as herein specified.\n. . . . .\nOwing to the unstable situation of materials and labour it is agreed that prices will be reviewed at the end of each 3 months period after delivery commences with a view to recosting up or down.\nTERMS OF PAYMENT\nPrice \u00a32.5.0d (TWO POUND, FIVE SHILLINGS) each nett. F.O.B. Manchester Dock. 10 per cent of the purchase price of 5,000 Transformers to be paid with official order that is \u00a31,150. (ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS). Balance against documents which are to be rendered to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, 2 Lombard Street, London, E.C. 3.\nDELIVERY\nTo be 10 weeks from date of official order at the rate of 400 per month to be stepped up to 1,600 per month within 7 months from date of official order.\nOn the day following the telephone conversation already mentioned, the appellant had written to Lome advising him that the agreement with Runbaken would be forwarded to him the following Tuesday. The letter adds,\nI quoted the price to you, which is 9 dollars f.o.b. Manchester\u2014this may on final analysis run to 9 dollars and 10 cents or somewhere in that vicinity, but no more.\nThe appellant sent Lome the executed agreement, by letter of January 30, calling his attention to various provisions, particularly referring to the term with respect to revision of price, and pointing out that work would not commence until the official order and the first payment of the price had been received.\nOn receipt of this letter, Lome cabled the appellant on February 5th that it would be necessary for the respondent to obtain a permit from the Foreign Exchange Control Board in order to send the \u00a31,150, but that the money would be cabled that week. On the same day Lome wrote the appellant stating that he had been advised by the manager of the respondent\u2019s bank that the granting of this permit was \u201cjust a matter of routine.\u201d By letter of the 10th of February, Lome advised the appellant that although a permit had been granted by the Board the previous week authorizing payment for the transformers within a period of six months, a new one had to be applied for as the transformers were to be delivered over a period of two years. The new permit had not yet come to hand. He explained the delay in receiving the permit as \u201capparently caused by some ruling beyond the capacity of ourselves and the bank\u201d, but asked the appellant in this letter if he would\ndo everything possible to keep peace with Runbaken until this export for English funds is obtained, and just mark time until I arrive in England.\nThe appellant complied with these instructions and in a letter of the 25th of February, 1947, to Lome he stated that he was endeavouring to keep the English company \u201cquiet over the question of their initial deposit,\u201d and that the latter was \u201cplaying ball with us to the extent of continuing their tooling up of the process and getting together the necessary materials for our transformers.\u201d This indicates that the appellant\u2019s statement in his letter of the 30th of January, that work would not commence until the official order had been received, meant only that actual manufacture of the transformers would not commence until that time. In the meantime, the English company was readying itself. The implication which the respondent sought to draw from the earlier statement, that the Runbaken company itself did not regard the agreement as a binding contract, is, I think, thus negatived.\nFor reasons of its own, the respondent never sent an order or made any payment, all the while maintaining to the appellant that difficulty was still being experienced in obtaining the permit. That such difficulty was imaginary and put forward for self-serving reasons appears from the evidence of the Toronto manager of the Control Board called by the appellant. He deposed that in February 1947, while a permit for the export of funds was necessary, the chartered banks had full authority as agents of the Board to grant permits for any amount in question under the Runbaken contract. The situation thus disclosed was left unexplained by the respondent, and the learned trial judge found that Lome was not \u201cfrank\u201d in his dealing with the appellant. The evidence of the Board\u2019s manager indicates that the real fact was as Lome had himself stated in his letter of the 5th of February, 1947, that the matter of a permit was, as he had been advised by the respondent\u2019s bank manager, \u201cjust a matter of routine.\u201d Subsequent events had impelled him to change his mind with respect to the desirability of the Runbaken contract. The alleged difficulty as to a permit was merely a convenient excuse.\nIt appears that, about the same time as the Runbaken contract was negotiated, the respondent, without letting the appellant know, had purchased from another English firm the same quantity of transformers as that ordered from Runbaken, and subsequently the market for the respondent\u2019s product, that is, oil burning equipment, had fallen off due to domestic conditions.\nIf anything more were needed to indicate the hollowness of the respondent\u2019s statements with respect to difficulty in obtaining a permit, it is supplied in Lome\u2019s letter to the appellant of the 3rd of March, 1947, in which he advises the latter of the purchase of the additional 20,000 transformers, stating that \u201cdeliveries are starting now.\u201d He does not explain how the funds to make payment for these goods had been obtained apparently without difficulty, while a permit with respect to the Runbaken contract was not forthcoming. On the 12th of March the respondent finally decided it would not go through with the Runbaken purchase because of information received that day with respect to the oil situation in Canada. The appellant was accordingly instructed \u201cto call off any deals that you may have made with Runbaken.\u201d The action here in question for commission was the result.\nIt was the opinion of the learned trial judge, concurred in by the Court of Appeal, that the Runbaken agreement did not constitute a concluded contract, and that as there had been no \u201cpurchase,\u201d the appellant had no right of action. In his opinion, the provision of the agreement with respect to an \u201cofficial order\u201d brought the case within the class of which Spottiswoode v. Doreen[20] (cited by the learned judge) is an example. That was the case of an offer by the defendants to take a lease accepted by the plaintiffs \u201csubject to the terms of a formal lease.\u201d In such cases, of course, there can be no binding contract unless a formal agreement is, in fact, executed. Under the agreement here in question the respondent in express terms \u201cagrees to purchase,\u201d but it has been read as though it: had contained the additional words, \u201cbut only if we subsequently send you 10 per cent of the purchase price and an official order.\u201d With respect, I think that so to construe the agreement is to imply something for which there is no foundation and which contradicts the actual language which the parties have used.\nWhen a person agrees to purchase goods, he agrees to take and pay for them. The ordinary, commercial meaning of the words, \u201cagrees to purchase,\u201d is \u201cagrees to buy;\u201d Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Gribble[21], per the Master of the Rolls and Kennedy L.J. To employ the language of Mignault J. in Grieve McClory Ltd. v. Dome Lumber Company[22], \u201can agreement to purchase implies a covenant to pay the purchase price.\u201d If this obligation is to be conditional only, more is required than is present in the instant case. Here, the express agreement to buy is followed only by \u201cterms of payment\u201d of the price including a first payment of ten per cent with \u201cofficial order.\u201d As no time is fixed for this, the law would imply a reasonable time but not a condition that it would not be fulfilled at all except at the buyer\u2019s option. In my opinion, therefore, the appellant did bring about a binding contract of purchase and sale.\nThe respondent further contends that this purchase was not of the character described by the commission agreement, in that the Runbaken company did not undertake to lay down the goods in Canada throughout the whole period of delivery at a total cost to the respondent, after all charges, not exceeding $15. It is the respondent\u2019s contention that many things, such as ocean freight, the rate of exchange, and customs duties, might have so fluctuated within the period of two years that the cost might have risen in excess of $15. Counsel made it plain that his argument went the length that no purchase was authorized under the commission agreement except one under which a vendor in England would expressly undertake to sell at such a sum from time to time as, notwithstanding future fluctuations in charges of any nature, there would never result a laid down cost to the respondent in Canada of more than $15.\nIn my opinion, such a contention is absurd on its face. No seller in his senses would have agreed to any such term and, therefore, it cannot be said that any two reasonable people would have contracted for the one to pay and the other to receive commissions only upon contracts of such a nature being effected. In my opinion, the agreement between the parties here meant that the price at which purchases were to be made in England would, at the time they should be made, be such that the laid down cost in Canada would not exceed $15. In the case of the Runbaken contract, the respondent was informed, as already shown, England was not more than $9.10, and it was satisfied before the contract was entered into that the price in therewith.\nThe respondent also points to the provision in the contract providing for revision in price, and that increased manufacturing costs might have resulted in an ultimate cost to the respondent of more than $15. This provision might have resulted in decreases in price as well as increases, and in any event, it was specifically called to the attention of the respondent in the letter with which the document was forwarded to it. Whatever might be the effect on the commission payable under the agreement in the event of the price of any of the transformers exceeding a laid down cost of $15, the presence of this term cannot, in my opinion, deprive the appellant of his right to commission.\nIt is next contended for the respondent that the appellant was entitled to commission only as deliveries were made in Canada, and that as no goods were delivered at all, the appellant is not entitled to anything. The law applicable is, I think, concisely laid down in the eleventh edition of Bowstead, p. 131, as follows:\nWhere a principal, in breach of an express or implied contract with his agent, refuses to complete a transaction, or otherwise prevents the agent from earning his remuneration, the agent is entitled to recover, by way of damages, the loss actually sustained by him as a natural and probable consequence of such breach of contract. The measure of damages, where nothing further remains to be done by the agent is the full amount that he would have earned if the principal had duly completed the transaction, or otherwise carried out his contract with the agent. The author points out at p. 127 that where the remuneration of the agent is payable upon the performance by him of a definite undertaking, he is entitled to be paid that remuneration as soon as he has done substantially all that he undertook to do, even if the principal acquire no benefit from his services, or the transaction in respect of which the remuneration is claimed fall through, provided that does not occur through any act or default of the agent. It will be useful, at this point, to consider the judgments of the members of this court who constituted the majority in Whyte v. National Paper Company[23].\nIn that case the appellant sued for commission under an agreement with the respondents by which the latter agreed to give him a commission of five per cent on all \u201caccepted\u201d orders obtained by him in Ontario, to be payable as soon as an order was shipped. Through the instrumentality of the appellant, a contract was entered into whereby a Toronto company \u201cagreed to purchase\u201d from the respondent during the period of a year, a certain description of paper to the value of not less than $35,000, delivery to be made from time to time on receipt of specifications from the purchasers and directions as to destination. When paper to the value of some $5,000 had been shipped, the purchaser refused to furnish further specifications or to take further deliveries on the ground that the paper already delivered had not been satisfactory, and the contract was not further performed.\nThe appellant contended that he was entitled to commission \u201cupon all accepted orders;\u201d that the contract in question was itself such an order; and that the failure of the respondents to supply the purchaser with the full amount of paper contracted for did not affect his right to remuneration as that failure was attributable to the default of the respondents themselves in not living up to their contract with the purchaser. The respondents, on the other hand, contended that no accepted order came into being until specifications were given by the purchaser under the contract and accepted by the respondents, and that no commission was payable unless the goods so ordered had been actually shipped. It was held by the trial judge, Middleton J. (6 O.W.N. 83), that the parties were contracting upon the assumption that each would perform its obligations, and that the respondents could not free themselves from liability to pay commission by breach of contract with the purchaser.\nThis judgment was set aside on appeal (17 D.L.R. 842), but a further appeal to this court was allowed. Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. accepted the view of the trial judge. The latter pointed out that if the word \u201cshipped\u201d meant actual shipment no matter for what reason, it would have been quite competent for the respondents to have dishonoured every order got, no matter how much labour or expense appellant might have put into obtaining it. In his view the parties could not be regarded as having contemplated any such thing and the word had therefore to be given a more reasonable meaning and not as applicable to what might, but for the default of the respondents, have been shipped. Anglin, J., with whom Davies J. agreed, thought that the better view was that the contract was not itself to be regarded as an \u201caccepted order,\u201d but as the fact that no accepted orders were forthcoming was due to the respondents\u2019 own default, the appellant was entitled to damages in an amount equal to the commission, he having done all he had agreed to do.\nIn the present case, taking the view that commission was not to be payable until delivery had been made to the respondent in Canada, I think it was not in the contemplation of the parties that, where a binding contract of purchase and sale had been effected by the appellant, he would not be entitled to be remunerated if the respondent, by its own deliberate act, prevented such contract being carried out. I therefore think that as the appellant had done all that he agreed to do, and the conduct of the respondent was the cause of there being no deliveries, the former is entitled to damages in the amount he would have otherwise been entitled to be paid as commission. This action, although brought for \u201ccommission,\u201d as was the fact in Whyte\u2019s case, was nevertheless brought on the footing that no deliveries had been in fact made. Whether what was claimed was designated as commission or damages equal to the commission made no difference to the dispute. Much reliance was placed by the respondent on the decision in Luxor v. Cooper[24]. That case has, however, no application. There the agent was entitled to a commission only on \u201ccompletion\u201d of a sale. In fact no sale was ever made and it was held that there was no obligation as between the principal and the agent to accept any offer.\nIn the case at bar, however, the appellant did effect a contract of sale and purchase, and there was, as already pointed out, an obligation on the respondent under the commission agreement with the appellant to accept delivery of goods so purchased.\nA point arises under the clause in the contract of purchase providing for a revision of the price in the event of changes in costs. It might have been that, had the contract been duly performed, some of the transformers might have cost the respondent more than $15. The effect of such an event upon the amount of the appellant\u2019s recovery was not discussed in argument, but taking into consideration all the circumstances, I do not think the claim can be reduced, upon the ground of such a possibility, by more than a nominal amount.\nWith respect to the defence that the appellant\u2019s claim had been the subject of a settlement between the parties, the learned trial judge found that the transaction referred to had no connection whatever with the claim sued upon. I see no ground upon which this finding can be disturbed. Although the point was not expressly abandoned on the argument, it was not seriously urged, and no other aspect of the transaction was argued.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and judgment entered in favour of the appellant for the sum of $18,121.90.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slaght, McMurtry, Ganong, Keith & Slaght.\nSolicitor for the respondent: David Sher.\n[1] [1951] O.W.N. 315.\n[2] [1950] O.W.N. 427.\n[3] [1941] 1 All E.R. 33.\n[4] (1925) 28 O.W.N. 320.\n[5] (1915) 51 S.C.R. 162.\n[6] (1919) 45 D.L.R. 434.\n[7] [1943] 1 All E.R. 501.\n[8] [1941] A.C. 108; 1 All.

The action was maintained by the trial judge but dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the contract annulled.\nHeld: In his advertisement of sale and in the negotiations leading to it, the respondent made statements as to the excellent condition of the autobus and of the returns from the route which, the evidence has shown, were false ; the fraudulent man\u0153uvres\u2014which went beyond any permissible moderate exaggerations\u2014had the effect of leading the appellant to enter into a contract which he would not have entered into had he been in possession of the real facts. The declaration in the contract that the autobus was bought in its actual condition of repairs clearly meant that he took it in the condition represented to him by the respondent.\nHeld also: As the defects had only appeared gradually, no acceptance of the situation, can be imputed to the appellant by the facts that he kept the autobus and had repairs done to it and took action only when he found that he had virtually no other recourse; the rule in Art. 1530 C.C. that the action to annull for hidden defects must be taken with reasonable diligence, is not so strict when there is fraud involved and a formal warranty, and in the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that there had been acceptance nor that the action was late. Moreover, acceptance is a question of fact on which the trial judge found in favour of the appellant.\nHeld further: The restitutio in integrum, without which a declaration of nullity for fraud cannot be obtained, is not possible in this case, but as the evidence shows that the deteriorations were not due to the fault of the appellant, the conditions of Art. 1087 C.C. are met and the respondent must receive the objects of the sale in the state in which they are without diminution of the price.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, allowing the appeal from the decision of the trial judge and dismissing an action asking the nullity of a contract for false representations. Gustave Mouette, K.C., and Maurice Gagn\u00e9, K.C., for the appellant. The question whether or not there was fraud is a question of fact and the evidence viewed as a whole justifies the finding of the trial judge that there had been false representations made in order to induce the appellant to purchase.\nThe evidence was rightly permitted by the trial judge. It is recognized doctrine in Quebec that a party may by oral evidence contradict or vary the terms of a written instrument, when the purpose of the oral evidence is to establish fraud of one of the parties (Raleigh v. Dumoulin 2 and Simardv. Tremblay 3). Moreover, the respondent himself introduced the oral evidence by questioning the appellant on discovery upon the representations made by the respondent prior to the sale.\nThere was no acceptance by the appellant of such a nature as to deprive him of the recourse in nullity of the contract. The case of Sirois v. Demers 4, applied by the Court of Appeal to this case, has no application in view of the special nature of the contract and since that case was a case under the legal warranty of latent defects.\nIt is claimed by the respondent that because four months elapsed between the purchase and the action, the action is barred by the operation of Art. 1530 C.C. and that that delay must be interpreted as an acceptance. That is not so, because Art. 1530 C.C. only applies where a contract is attacked for latent defects under the legal warranty. Our case is not one like that. It is an action in nullity based on the fraud and false representations. In these circumstances, Art. 1530 C.C. does not apply (Touchette v. Pizagalli 5, Bernier v. Grenier Motor Co., 6 and Patterson v. Wembley Garage 7).\nMoreover, even if the action could be said to fall under Art. 1530 C.C., under the particular circumstances of this case, the delay is not too long and stays within the conditions of that article (Franc\u0153ur v. Doucet 8). Even if the action were one for latent defects, a delay of four months would be reasonable here in view of the fact that the business could not be tested without having been operated for sometime and without both motors having been given a fair trial.\nTo the contention that the stipulation in the contract to the effect that the autobus is sold in the state of repairs in which it was at the time of the sale, prevents the appellant from claiming the nullity on account of fraud, it is answered that this cannot be the meaning of such a clause, but rather that the autobus was in the condition in which it was represented to be by the respondent. The clause was dictated by the respondent and it cannot be interpreted as a clause excluding any warranty whatever nor as a clause permitting the respondent to deliver to his purchaser something different from what the latter had intended to purchase.\nThe restitutio in integrum was made and any deteriorations cannot be imputed to the appellant but are the sole responsibility of the respondent.\nL. A. Pouliot, K.C., and Rolland Legendre for the respondent. The appellant did not establish false representations giving rise to an action in annulment of the deed of purchase.\nThe verbal evidence, moreover, tendered by the appellant is illegal as tending to contradict or vary the deed of purchase in writing (Art. 1234 C.C.).\nThe appellant's action is ill founded in law because (a) he has utilized the autobus and made acts of acceptance of the thing sold with full knowledge and has acted as absolute master of same, even making changes to the thing; (b) he did not make a restitutio in integrum as he was bound to do to obtain the annulment of the sale, and (c) the action was tardy.\nThe following authorities were cited inter alia by the respondent: Benjamin On Sale, 6th Edition; Digney v. Roberts 9; Desrochers v. Patenaude 10; Lincourt v. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux 11; Sirois v. Demers 12 and Ledoux v. Motors Supply Ltd. 13.

Lors de l'argument, l'appelant s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 du moyen all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9claration, et r\u00e9sultant des d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s de la chose.\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'il n'y a pas eu de fausses repr\u00e9sentations, que l'appelant a accept\u00e9 l'autobus ainsi que tout ce qu'il a achet\u00e9, en toute connaissance de cause, qu'il s'en est servi, que l'action est tardive, et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il n'y a pas de restitutio in integrum, condition essentielle \u00e0 l'annulation de la vente.\nEn vertu du contrat, le demandeur a achet\u00e9 un \"autobus de marque Reo, mod\u00e8le 1933, de 25 places\"\u2026, \"le tout dans son \u00e9tat d'entretien actuel\"\u2026 \"tous les droits quelconques acquis au vendeur de la R\u00e9gie Provinciale du Transport\"\u2026 \"toute la client\u00e8le ou achalandage dudit vendeur comme op\u00e9rateur d'autobus\"\u2026 \"tous les outils et accessoires quelconques dudit autobus\"\u2026 \"l'occupation d'un garage dans le village de St-Gr\u00e9goire \u00e0 raison de $10.00 par mois jusqu'au 1er novembre 1946, et \u00e0 raison de $15.00 \u00e0 partir du 1er novembre 1946 au 1er mai 1947\"\u2026 \"le moteur de rechange qui se trouve dans le garage du vendeur\"\u2026 \"pour et en consid\u00e9ration de la somme de $7,500 pay\u00e9e comptant\". Pour donner suite \u00e0 cette entente, le demandeur a pris livraison de l'autobus le 30 ao\u00fbt 1946, a obtenu le transfert des polices d'assurance de m\u00eame que du permis de la R\u00e9gie Provinciale, l'autorisant \u00e0 op\u00e9rer la ligne entre le village de St-Gr\u00e9goire et le moulin de la Dominion Textile, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des travaileurs qui y sont employ\u00e9s.\nC'est comme cons\u00e9quence d'une annonce parue dans \"L'Action Catholique\", journal de Qu\u00e9bec, que le demandeur qui est de Beauport, est entr\u00e9 en n\u00e9gociations avec le d\u00e9fendeur, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 St-Gr\u00e9goire. Les 8 et 14 ao\u00fbt 1946, ce quotidien publiait:\nAUTOBUS A VENDRE\nAUTOBUS REO, vingt-sept passagers (27), carrosserie neuve deux ans, m\u00e9canisme parfait ordre. Diff\u00e9rentiel, Clutch, Moteur et frein neuf, et aussi permis pour quelqu'un int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Prix int\u00e9ressant pour acheteur prompt et s\u00e9rieux. Cause de sant\u00e9. T\u00e9l.: 4-5091.\nLes deux fr\u00e8res du demandeur, Arthur et \u00c9mile Lortie, furent les premiers \u00e0 prendre connaissance de cette annonce, et apr\u00e8s avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9fendeur, all\u00e8rent le rencontrer \u00e0 St-Gr\u00e9goire le 11 ao\u00fbt, pour obtenir des informations. Ils y retourn\u00e8rent de nouveau, mais cette fois avec le demandeur, une semaine plus tard, soit le ou vers le 18 du m\u00eame mois. Tous deux portaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier \u00e0 cette transaction, car de concert avec leur p\u00e8re, ils songeaient \u00e0 trouver une situation au demandeur, \u00e0 peine \u00e2g\u00e9 alors de 25 ans.\nAu cours de la premi\u00e8re entrevue, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage d'Arthur et d'\u00c9mile Lortie, le d\u00e9fendeur leur aurait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que l'autobus, qui \u00e9tait en parfait ordre, pouvait valoir entre $12,000 et $15,000. Il leur aurait dit qu'il s'agissait bien d'un Reo 1933, 27 places, que la carrosserie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e deux ans auparavant, que les freins, le diff\u00e9rentiel et les pneus \u00e9taient neufs, que le moteur qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 perc\u00e9 une fois, pouvait encore \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour 10,000 \u00e0 15,000 milles, que tout le m\u00e9canisme \u00e9tait en excellente condition. Quant au moteur de rechange, il n'avait servi que tr\u00e8s peu. La client\u00e8le rapportait quotidiennement de $25 \u00e0 $30 les jours de beau temps, et $30 \u00e0 $35 les jours de pluie. De plus, les excursions les dimanches et jours de cong\u00e9 augmentaient substantiellement les revenus. Selon lui, Bouchard d\u00e9tenait pratiquement toute la client\u00e8le de la Dominion Textile, et c'est un nomm\u00e9 Guimont, un comp\u00e9titeur, qui transportait le surplus des voyageurs. Malgr\u00e9 l'excellent \u00e9tat de son autobus, Bouchard aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 le vendre pour $8,500. Les deux fr\u00e8res du demandeur qui ne sont pas des m\u00e9caniciens, et qui n'ont aucune exp\u00e9rience dans l'automobile, n'ont pas examin\u00e9 l'autobus, mais quelques instants avant de quitter le d\u00e9fendeur, ils se sont rendus au garage o\u00f9 Bouchard a fait tourner le moteur, et les a invit\u00e9s \u00e0 monter s'asseoir \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la voiture.\nAu cours de la seconde entrevue \u00e0 laquelle le demandeur \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent avec ses deux fr\u00e8res, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 ses d\u00e9clarations de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente quant \u00e0 la valeur de son autobus et l'excellente condition dans laquelle il se trouvait. Il aurait \u00e9galement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu'il avait auparavant affirm\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et aux revenus qu'il retirait de son exploitation. Il aurait ajout\u00e9 cependant que son autobus \u00e9tait \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un ch\u00e2ssis courb\u00e9, et non pas d'un ch\u00e2ssis droit, qui ne convient pas \u00e0 un v\u00e9hicule de ce genre. Avant de se s\u00e9parer, le demandeur et ses deux fr\u00e8res, accompagn\u00e9s de Bouchard le d\u00e9fendeur, se sont rendus \u00e0 bord de l'autobus au moulin de la Dominion Textile et, apparemment, rien d'anormal ne fut remarqu\u00e9. Le demandeur explique que l'autobus roulait sur de tr\u00e8s beaux chemins et qu'il \u00e9tait \"all\u00e8ge\". Le demandeur a fait une deuxi\u00e8me visite, accompagn\u00e9 de son jeune fr\u00e8re, l'abb\u00e9 G\u00e9rard Lortie, le 22 ao\u00fbt, alors que les m\u00eames repr\u00e9sentations leur auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le d\u00e9fendeur.\nEnfin, durant la journ\u00e9e du 24 ao\u00fbt, M. Napol\u00e9on Lortie, p\u00e8re de l'appelant, qui consentait \u00e0 lui procurer les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour lui permettre de se porter acqu\u00e9reur de l'autobus, rencontra l'intim\u00e9 deux fois. A leur premi\u00e8re entrevue, qui fut tr\u00e8s courte, on a convenu de se rencontrer de nouveau le soir du 24, date o\u00f9 expirait l'offre de vente, car d'apr\u00e8s l'intim\u00e9, si l'acheteur ne signait pas le contrat ce jour-l\u00e0, il vendrait \u00e0 un autre acheteur. Ce soir-l\u00e0, M. Napol\u00e9on Lortie, accompagn\u00e9 du demandeur Roland et de son autre fils, l'abb\u00e9 G\u00e9rard, s'est rendu au garage de l'intim\u00e9, a vu l'autobus, ainsi que le moteur de rechange. L'intim\u00e9 donna \u00e0 M. Napol\u00e9on Lortie \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames informations qu'il avait donn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, sur l'excellente condition de son autobus, et il fut en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 cause de ces repr\u00e9sentations, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de signer un contrat. Un document pr\u00e9liminaire fut sign\u00e9 ce soir-l\u00e0, un acompte de $500 fut vers\u00e9, et le 27, le contrat d\u00e9finitif fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 devant Jobidon, N.P. La vente fut conclue pour un prix convenu de $7,500.\nIl fut aussi entendu que l'intim\u00e9 continuerait \u00e0 op\u00e9rer la ligne pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'appelant durant quelques jours, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que ce dernier puisse se trouver une pension \u00e0 St-Gr\u00e9goire, et jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il ait abandonn\u00e9 le travail qu'il faisait pour son p\u00e8re \u00e0 Beauport. L'appelant arriva \u00e0 St-Gr\u00e9goire le 29 ao\u00fbt dans la soir\u00e9e, et l'intim\u00e9 lui remit alors le produit des op\u00e9rations d'une journ\u00e9e et demie, temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis la signature du contrat. Ces recettes n'\u00e9taient que de $6 ou $7, et l'appelant a imm\u00e9diatement manifest\u00e9 son d\u00e9sappointement, surtout apr\u00e8s les repr\u00e9sentations formelles qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par l'intim\u00e9. L'appelant commen\u00e7a \u00e0 op\u00e9rer personnellement le service le 30 ao\u00fbt, et c'est alors que les troubles se multipli\u00e8rent, de m\u00eame que les d\u00e9fauts de m\u00e9canisme qui ont amen\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action.\nDurant les quatre mois qu'il se servit de l'autobus, l'appelant eut maintes occasions de constater que l'annonce publi\u00e9e dans \"L'Action Catholique\", de m\u00eame que les repr\u00e9sentations faites par l'intim\u00e9, n'\u00e9taient pas l'expression de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et contenaient des affirmations qu'on ne saurait imputer \u00e0 de simples erreurs.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet autobus n'est pas de marque Eeo, mod\u00e8le 1933. Il est un ancien Gotfredson, mod\u00e8le 1928, reconstitu\u00e9 par le rassemblement de vieilles pi\u00e8ces rapport\u00e9es, et provenant de diverses sources. Il n'est pas plus un Reo qu'il n'est un Gotfredson ou un General Motors. La carrosserie est celle d'un ancien Chevrolet; elle n'est pas neuve de deux ans tel que repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, mais elle est une tr\u00e8s ancienne carrosserie, mise au rancart \u00e0 St-Hyacinthe, sur le bord d'une rivi\u00e8re, pour \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement d\u00e9truite \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat de v\u00e9tust\u00e9; elle fut n\u00e9anmoins pos\u00e9e sur le ch\u00e2ssis de l'autobus vendu, en 1943, par un M. Pr\u00e9vost de Ste-Claire, qui y installa les si\u00e8ges de l'ancienne, devenue compl\u00e8tement hors d'usage. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas imperm\u00e9able, et la pluie qui y p\u00e9n\u00e9trait incommodait fort les passagers. Elle vibrait d'une fa\u00e7on anormale aussit\u00f4t que le v\u00e9hicule atteignait une vitesse de quinze milles \u00e0 l'heure. Le ch\u00e2ssis, de marque Gotfredson, au lieu d'\u00eatre courb\u00e9, \u00e9tait droit, et \u00e9videmment cass\u00e9 lors de la vente, car l'appelant dut le faire souder vu que la voiture mena\u00e7ait de s'effondrer sous le poids des passagers. L'essieu d'en avant et d'arri\u00e8re, le volant, le grillage ant\u00e9rieur, \u00e9taient de marque General Motors. L'embrayage, la transmission, le radiateur, \u00e9taient de fabrication Reo. Cet embrayage fut remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de nombreuses d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s, et la transmission n\u00e9cessita plusieurs r\u00e9parations par suite de son usure. Les freins qui perdaient leur huile, ne fonctionnaient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s pas, et les pneus \u00e9taient pratiquement finis. L'arbre de couche \u00e9tait faux, et \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment la cause de la vibration de tout le v\u00e9hicule que j'ai signal\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0. Le moteur qui se trouvait sur l'autobus lors de la prise de possession par l'appelant, \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat extr\u00eame de d\u00e9labrement. Il br\u00fblait une grande quantit\u00e9 d'huile, et la fum\u00e9e de son tuyau d'\u00e9chappement projetait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la carrosserie une fum\u00e9e intol\u00e9rable. Les batteries faisaient d\u00e9faut, tellement qu'il fallut installer un nouveau g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur.\nPar suite des nombreuses difficult\u00e9s qu'il \u00e9prouvait, l'appelant d\u00e9cida, dans le cours du mois d'octobre, de faire enlever le moteur et de le remplacer par l'autre moteur de rechange qu'il avait achet\u00e9, et que l'intim\u00e9 lui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant en parfait ordre. Le garagiste de St-Gr\u00e9goire de Montmorency \u00e0 qui l'ouvrage fut confi\u00e9, M. \u00c9milien Lesage, trouva imm\u00e9diatement que ce moteur n'\u00e9tait pas en ordre et qu'il fallait percer les cylindres. Cet ouvrage, \u00e0 cause de sa nature d\u00e9licate, fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par la maison P. L. Lortie, de Qu\u00e9bec, et l'intim\u00e9 admet dans son t\u00e9moignage que ce moteur n'\u00e9tait pas neuf, mais au contraire, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 perc\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 et qu'il avait servi de 1938 \u00e0 1944, c'est-\u00e0-dire durant environ six ans. Apr\u00e8s les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 ce moteur, il roula de fa\u00e7on assez satisfaisante jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'arriva la saison d'hiver. Durant le mois de d\u00e9cembre, les troubles recommenc\u00e8rent de nouveau puisqu'il y avait des fuites d'eau impossibles \u00e0 r\u00e9parer \u00e0 cause du manque de pi\u00e8ces, et qu'il \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence inutile d'y placer de l'antigel. Il arriva que le moteur gela \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1946. La situation \u00e9tait si mauvaise, que l'appelant a d\u00fb laisser l'autobus au garage \u00e0 maintes reprises, et plusieurs fois durant l'automne, il dut louer de la Compagnie d'Autobus de Charlesbourg un autre v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 raison de $25 par jour, afin de pouvoir continuer son service. Entre le 27 ao\u00fbt, date o\u00f9 fut sign\u00e9 le contrat, et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1946, l'appelant d\u00e9pensa $1,080.67 en r\u00e9parations, et dut payer \u00e9galement $250 pour la location d'un autre autobus.\nDe plus, cet autobus \u00e9tait loin de valoir entre $12,000 et $15,000, tel que l'avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 au demandeur lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 son p\u00e8re et \u00e0 ses trois fr\u00e8res. Il fut achet\u00e9 \u00e0 un encan en 1928 par un M. J. A. Fortier qui, en 1936, le vendit \u00e0 P. L. Lortie pour le prix de $1,300. L'intim\u00e9 luim\u00eame l'acheta en 1937 de P. L. Lortie pour $3,200, pay\u00e9 en partie en argent et en partie par l'\u00e9change d'une autre voiture. M. Omer Forgues qui, en 1946, \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de la Commission des Prix et du Commerce en temps de guerre, et qui repr\u00e9sentait le contr\u00f4leur des v\u00e9hicules-moteurs, nous dit que cet autobus, \u00e0 la date de l'achat, valait au plus $1,500.\nDans le cours du mois de mai 1947, le demandeur fut incapable de louer un nouvel autobus et s'effor\u00e7a, en cons\u00e9quence, d'op\u00e9rer avec l'autobus achet\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, mais la R\u00e9gie Provinciale lui refusa son permis parce que ledit autobus \u00e9tait trop d\u00e9fectueux, et qu'il n'offrait pas des conditions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires pour le transport des passagers. Les compagnies d'assurance refus\u00e8rent le renouvellement des polices pour des raisons identiques. Ces faits, qui sont post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'action, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par l'appelant dans une r\u00e9ponse suppl\u00e9mentaire, avec la permission de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure accord\u00e9e en vertu des dispositions de l'article 199 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nLes revenus \u00e9taient \u00e9galement substantiellement diff\u00e9rents de ce que l'intim\u00e9 avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Jamais les recettes ne furent sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 $15 par jour, quelle que f\u00fbt la temp\u00e9rature, et la moyenne quotidienne \u00e9tait entre $7 et $15. Durant les mois de septembre, octobre, novembre et d\u00e9cembre, les recettes ne furent m\u00eame pas \u00e9gales au co\u00fbt des r\u00e9parations et au prix de location d'un autre autobus, et par suite du mauvais \u00e9tat de la voiture, les excursions du dimanche et des jours de cong\u00e9 furent impossibles.\nNous sommes bien loin des faits repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l'annonce de \"L'Action Catholique\", et au cours des conversations intervenues, o\u00f9 l'on annon\u00e7ait un autobus Reo, carrosserie neuve de deux ans, dont le m\u00e9canisme \u00e9tait en parfait ordre, pourvu d'un diff\u00e9rentiel, d'un embrayage, d'un moteur et de freins neufs, enfin, d'une machine en excellente condition. Les faits ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'appelant, \u00e0 cause des repr\u00e9sentations de l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas obtenu pour son argent, la valeur \u00e0 laquelle il avait droit de s'attendre. C'est d'ailleurs la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s qui qualifie justement de \"fausses et trompeuses\" les repr\u00e9sentations faites par l'intim\u00e9.\nCertes, un vendeur n'est pas tenu de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier sa marchandise; il peut m\u00eame la \"farder\" quelque peu, ou si l'on veut en exag\u00e9rer mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment les qualit\u00e9s existantes, mais la loi interdit les manoeuvres dolosives, celles-l\u00e0 qui font na\u00eetre l'erreur dans l'esprit de l'autre partie contractante, et la d\u00e9terminent \u00e0 agir (C.C. 993). Dans ce cas, il y a clairement dol, et le contrat est en cons\u00e9quence annulable. C'est \u00e9videmment ce qui s'est produit dans le cas qui nous est soumis. Nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence de l'exag\u00e9ration qu'un vendeur honn\u00eate peut se permettre, sans violer les lois qui autorisent la r\u00e9siliation des contrats, mais nous sommes plut\u00f4t devant des affirmations et des repr\u00e9sentations sans fondement, qui ont induit l'appelant en erreur et qui l'ont pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 signer le contrat dont il demande maintenant l'annulation.\nLa Cour d'Appel 15, avec la dissidence de MM. les Juges Casey et Bertrand, qui sont d'avis qu'il y a eu des man\u0153uvres dolosives, base surtout son jugement sur le fait que l'acheteur a acquis l'autobus \"dans son \u00e9tat d'entretien actuel\", que l'acheteur savait qu'il s'agissait d'une ancienne voiture ayant subi de nombreuses transformations, que les d\u00e9fauts existants \u00e9taient de constatation facile, qu'il a gard\u00e9 l'autobus apr\u00e8s les avoir constat\u00e9s et y avoir effectu\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations, que l'action est tardive, et qu'enfin la restitutio in integrum de la part du demandeur \u00e9tait impossible au moment de l'institution de l'action.\nJe ne puis, avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, me rallier \u00e0 ce raisonnement. Il ne s'agit pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'une demande en annulation pour d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s, mais bien d'une demande en annulation pour fausses repr\u00e9sentations. L'acheteur \u00e9tait de bonne foi; il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de croire \u00e0 la parole du vendeur qui vantait les qualit\u00e9s de sa voiture, et il avait raison de penser que la marchandise qu'il achetait \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s de valeur \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle qu'on lui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. S'il avait simplement achet\u00e9 une voiture de \"seconde main\", sans que la vente ne f\u00fbt accompagn\u00e9e de repr\u00e9sentations, la situation des parties eut \u00e9t\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre diff\u00e9rente. Mais tel n'est pas le cas. Quand le demandeur a achet\u00e9 cet autobus et que devant le notaire Jobidon, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 qu'il en faisait l'acquisition \"dans son \u00e9tat d'entretien actuel\", il est certain qu'il r\u00e9f\u00e9rait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de la voiture tel que repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur. Il n'achetait pas une voiture rapi\u00e9c\u00e9e, dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle \u00e9tait, mais bien une voiture dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 le d\u00e9fendeur lui avait dit qu'elle \u00e9tait, avec l'usure normale et ordinaire attach\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat.\nOn reproche \u00e0 l'appelant d'avoir gard\u00e9 l'autobus apr\u00e8s avoir connu les d\u00e9fauts, et d'y avoir fait faire lui-m\u00eame les r\u00e9parations, ce qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une acceptation de sa part, et l'emp\u00eacherait ainsi de r\u00e9clamer maintenant l'annulation de la vente. Il ne faut pas oublier cependant que les d\u00e9fauts se sont manifest\u00e9s graduellement, et qu'au d\u00e9but, les troubles constat\u00e9s par le demandeur n'\u00e9taient pas tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux; ce n'est qu'avec le temps qu'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient plus graves, et chaque fois qu'il en parlait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, ce dernier s'effor\u00e7ait de temporiser et de faire croire \u00e0 l'appelant qu'ils \u00e9taient sans importance. Et c'est comme r\u00e9sultat de l'accumulation de tous ces d\u00e9fauts, qui n'ont pas pris tous le m\u00eame temps \u00e0 se manifester, que le demandeur a enfin institu\u00e9 son action au bout de quatre mois, apr\u00e8s avoir essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9parer les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s qu'il constatait et qui allaient toujours en augmentant. D'ailleurs, ce n'est qu'au mois de novembre, quand il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que le premier moteur fonctionnait mal, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible au demandeur de constater \u00e9galement par le changement qu'il a op\u00e9r\u00e9, que le second moteur n'\u00e9tait pas meilleur, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas tel que repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, et qu'il \u00e9tait inapte au service auquel il \u00e9tait destin\u00e9.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il y ait eu acceptation de l'\u00e9tat de choses par le demandeur, ni que son action soit tardive. Il est entendu, et la jurisprudence reconna\u00eet bien le principe que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une demande en annulation de contrat pour vices cach\u00e9s de la chose, l'article 1530 C.C. doit trouver son application, et l'action doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre institu\u00e9e avec diligence raisonnable. Mais la r\u00e8gle a moins de rigueur quand il s'agit de fausses repr\u00e9sentations, et la m\u00eame c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'est pas une condition essentielle \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de l'action. La cause de Sirois v. Demers 16 n'a pas d'application. Il s'agissait dans cette affaire de l'annulation d'un \u00e9change d'automobile, mais ce recours a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 parce que le demandeur y aurait renonc\u00e9, en faisant faire lui-m\u00eame les r\u00e9parations que le d\u00e9fendeur s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 payer. C'est plut\u00f4t la cause de Bernier v. Grenier Motor Co. Ltd., 17, jugement confirm\u00e9 par cette Cour 18, qui doit nous guider dans la d\u00e9termination du pr\u00e9sent litige. Dans cette cause, la Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'article 1530 C.C. applicable au cas de demande en nullit\u00e9 pour vices r\u00e9dhibitoires, ne l'est pas dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'agit de garantie conventionnelle et formelle, et l'action en r\u00e9solution peut alors \u00eatre intent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par cet article, surtout lorsque le demandeur all\u00e8gue et prouve erreur, dol, fraude et fausses repr\u00e9sentations. (Vide \u00e9galement Silver v. Drennan 19; Lefebvre v. Montpetit 20; Poulin v. Gr\u00e9goire 21.\nIl y aura certainement des cas o\u00f9 une action, intent\u00e9e trop tard apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte de d\u00e9fauts de la chose vendue, m\u00eame s'il y a eu dol ou fausses repr\u00e9sentations, ne pourra r\u00e9ussir, mais dans le cas qui nous occupe, si l'on tient compte des circonstances relat\u00e9es plus haut, je ne puis en venir \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a eu acceptation par le demandeur, ni que son action soit tardive. Il ne faut pas d'ailleurs oublier que la question de savoir si la conduite d'un acheteur peut nous amener \u00e0 conclure qu'il y a eu acceptation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 le priver d'une action r\u00e9dhibitoire, est une question de faits, et dans le cas qui nous occupe, le juge au proc\u00e8s l'a r\u00e9solue en faveur de l'appelant. (Touchette v. Pizzagalli 22).\nIl reste la question de savoir si le demandeur a offert avec son action tout ce qu'il a re\u00e7u, et si la restitutio in integrum de sa part est possible. Ce dernier n'a pas seulement achet\u00e9 un autobus et un moteur de rechange, mais il s'est \u00e9galement port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur de la client\u00e8le du d\u00e9fendeur ainsi que du permis d\u00e9tenu par ce dernier et \u00e9mis par la Commisison de R\u00e9gie Provinciale. Le demandeur ne peut r\u00e9ussir que s'il peut remettre au d\u00e9fendeur tout ce qu'il a obtenu comme r\u00e9sultat du contrat intervenu. Il est en effet de principe, que par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir les parties doivent \u00eatre remises dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat, comme si le contrat n'avait jamais exist\u00e9. Chaque partie doit rendre ce qu'elle a re\u00e7u, et le statu quo ant\u00e9rieur doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. L'article 1000 C.C. stipule que l'erreur, le dol, la violence ou la crainte donnent un droit d'action pour faire annuler ou rescinder les contrats qui en sont attach\u00e9s. L'article 1065 C.C. est \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'effet que quand l'une des parties \u00e0 un contrat ne remplit pas son obligation, la r\u00e9solution du contrat d'o\u00f9 na\u00eet cette obligation peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e. Il est clair cependant que la restitutio in integrum doit \u00eatre possible, mais la r\u00e8gle qui gouverne en ce cas, est la m\u00eame que celle que l'on trouve \u00e0 l'article 1088 C.C., c'est-\u00e0-dire que la condition r\u00e9solutoire, lorsqu'elle est accomplie, oblige chacune des parties \u00e0 rendre ce qu'elle a re\u00e7u et remet les choses au m\u00eame \u00e9tat que si le contrat n'avait pas exist\u00e9. En ce qui concerne les choses qui ont p\u00e9ri ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es, c'est alors la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle que celle contenue \u00e0 l'article 1087 C.C. qui trouve son application, c'est-\u00e0-dire que si la chose ne peut plus \u00eatre livr\u00e9e, ou si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e sans la faute du d\u00e9biteur, le cr\u00e9ancier doit la recevoir dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouve sans diminution de prix. (Vide : Mignault, Vol. 5, pages 241, 448 et 449.)\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, le demandeur a offert dans son action de remettre et livrer au d\u00e9fendeur, sur paiement de la somme de $7,500, tout ce qui est mentionn\u00e9 au contrat Exhibit P.1, ce qui \u00e9videmment comprend l'autobus, le moteur de rechange, la client\u00e8le et les outils. En ce qui concerne le permis d'op\u00e9rations, il d\u00e9clare le maintenir aux frais et d\u00e9pens de m\u00eame qu'aux risques et p\u00e9rils du d\u00e9fendeur, afin que ce permis ne soit pas r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par la R\u00e9gie Provinciale de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir, apr\u00e8s jugement, le remettre au d\u00e9fendeur. Il est possible que l'autobus et le moteur de rechange ne soient pas en aussi bon \u00e9tat que lorsque le demandeur les a re\u00e7us, mais je ne crois pas qu'aucune faute puisse lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e. Quant \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite, et quant au permis, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 au mois de mai 1947, le d\u00e9fendeur ne pourra s'en prendre qu'\u00e0 luim\u00eame. C'est \u00e0 cause du mauvais \u00e9tat de l'autobus que la client\u00e8le a diminu\u00e9, et que le permis a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9. Pour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nFauteux, J.:\u2014Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge Taschereau, je maintiendrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Pr\u00e9vost, Gagn\u00e9 and Flynn.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Lessard, Legendre and Levesque.\n1 Q.R.

Kelly, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 521\nDate: 1952-04-22\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nDame Ethel Quinlan Kelly (Defendant) Respondent.\n1951: November 13, 14; 1952: April 22.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWife\u2014Common as to property\u2014Promissory note for board and lodging signed jointly by husband and wife\u2014Whether debt of the community\u2014Whether wife obliged herself \"with or for\" her husband\u2014Alimentary pension\u2014Natural obligation\u2014Arts. 166,173, 1301, 1317 C.C.\nThe respondent, common as to property, lived with her husband and daughter in the appellant's hotel in Montreal from April 1932 to May 1934. The accounts for board and lodging were rendered weekly in the names of the three who had signed the hotel register. During their stay, the accounts were frequently paid by cheques drawn by the respondent on her own bank account. However, the accounts were not paid regularly with the result that arrears gradually accumulated. Two promissory notes, signed by the respondent and endorsed by her husband, were given to the appellant at different dates, and then on June 20, 1939, a new note, signed jointly and severally by the respondent and her husband, was taken. The action, based on that last note, was maintained against the husband (who did not appeal), and dismissed against the respondent. The judgment dismissing the action as against the respondent was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld (The Chief Justice and Kellock J. dissenting), that the appeal and the action should be dismissed. Per Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The debt, being a liability of the community, was the debt of the husband, and by signing the note\u2014assuming that the wife bound herself ex contractu to pay it\u2014she obliged herself with and for her husband otherwise than as prescribed for by Art. 1301 C.C., since the husband remained at all times the debtor.\nThe argument that in view of the lack of means of the community and of the husband and in view of the capacity of the wife to support that charge of the marriage, the wife became by virtue of Arts. 165, 173 and 1317 C.C. legally obliged, is not tenable because the evidence does not disclose any of the circumstances which would enable the husband to claim from the respondent an alimentary pension, and therefore, even if third parties could invoke the rights of a husband against his wife for alimentary pension (which is doubtful), the appellant could not do so in this case.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, St-Germain J.A. dissenting, the dismissal as against a wife of an action on a promissory note signed jointly and severally by the wife and her husband for the payment of board and lodging.\nL. E. Beaulieu, K.C., and L. G. Pr\u00e9vost, K.C., for the appellant. The promissory note was given in voluntary execution of a natural obligation and is therefore legally binding on the respondent under Art. 1140 C.C. There was a natural obligation morally binding on respondent who voluntarily acknowledged it. By so doing, respondent personally assumed a civil obligation towards the appellant which the respondent undertook to execute and discharge out of her own personal property by means of the promissory note. That such a note was given for a valid consideration cannot be disputed in the face of our doctrine and jurisprudence. It is now too late for the respondent to attempt to repudiate the natural obligation which has been converted into a civil obligation by the mere effect of the respondent's voluntary acknowledgment. Pesant v. Pesant 2.\nThe respondent signed the note in execution of a legal obligation. She had, under Arts. 165, 173 and 1317 C.C, the legal obligation to pay the hotel account. Debien v. Dumoulin 3, Montminy v. Paquet 4, Dubeau v. Greffe 5 and Faucher v. Larue 6. Article 1301 C.C. does not apply in the case of a promissory note given by the wife in execution of a natural or legal obligation. That Article supposes that the wife has entered into a contractual obligation for or with her husband. It does not absolve the wife from an obligation created by law. If it did, it would create an exception to the rule of Arts. 165 and 173, and no such exception is made by these articles. In signing with her husband, she did not bind herself to anything to which she was not already personally subject, as the obligation to supply life's necessaries is a paramount one, imposed on each consort by law and by nature.\nArticle 1301 C.C. does not apply because the respondent did not become surety for her husband debt. The wife has the burden of showing that she bound herself for her husband; that she really became the surety of her husband for his purpose and benefit; that she herself derived no personal benefit from the transaction; and that the debt was not her affair in any way. The evidence shows that although the respondent signed with her husband, she undertook to fulfil her own natural or legal obligation and that she derived personal benefit when she received food and shelter at appellant's hotel with her own minor daughter whom she was naturally and legally bound to support when her husband was not in a position to do so. La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet 7.\nThe appellant is a creditor in good faith and if Article 1301 C.C. applies he is within the exception provided in that article.\nC. M. Cotton, K.C., for the respondent. The consideration for the original note of which the note sued upon is the last renewal, was solely a liability of the community, that is, an obligation of the husband of the respondent as head of the community. This debt falls squarely within the provisions of Art. 1280 C.C.\nIt is established by the authors and by the jurisprudence that for such a community obligation, the respondent could not be personally responsible. Hudon v. Marceau 8, Frigon v. Cot\u00e9 9 and Montminy v. Paquet 10. It results therefore that the respondent, in signing the note, bound herself with and for her husband; and under the provisions of Art. 1301 C.C. and 1374 C.C., no action lies against the respondent on the note, nor can any judgment be rendered against her thereon. There is no article in the Code Napol\u00e9on corresponding to this article, whose provisions are of public order. Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette 11, and Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet 12.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting) : J'ai eu l'avantage de prendre connaissance du jugement pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Kellock, et je concours avec lui.\nJe tiens seulement \u00e0 ajouter les commentaires qui suivent, surtout apr\u00e8s avoir rendu moi-m\u00eame, au nom de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, les jugements dans les causes ant\u00e9rieures, o\u00f9 nous avons eu \u00e0 appliquer l'article 1301 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res 13; Rodrigue v. Dostie 14; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Canette 15 ; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet 16 et Sterling Woollens & Silks Company v. Lashinsky 17).\nD\u00e8s l'abord, il est peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 propos de faire remarquer que dans chacune de ces affaires le jugement de cette Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime.\nPour moi, ce qui distingue toutes ces causes de l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle est que, dans chacune d'elles, il s'agissait d'une femme mari\u00e9e qui avait garanti la dette de son mari, tandis qu'ici, il s'agit tout simplement de la dette de la femme elle-m\u00eame.\nLe billet qui fait l'objet de l'action de l'appelante est sign\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, Dame Ethel Quinlan Kelly. A sa face, elle est donc responsable \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 raison de la promesse de paiement qu'il contient et \u00e0 raison de sa signature.\nPour s'y soustraire, il lui faut n\u00e9cessairement invoquer l'article 1301 du Code Civil et justifier que son cas est couvert par cet article. Il convient tout d'abord de rappeler que par l'expression \"s'obliger\" le Code, dans cet article, vise uniquement le cautionnement de la femme avec ou pour son mari. Comme cette Cour l'a fait remarquer dans la cause de Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet, cit\u00e9e ci-dessus, cette interpr\u00e9tation est maintenant fix\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. La Cour du Banc du Roi l'a affirm\u00e9e dans Lebel v. Bradin 18, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame dans les diff\u00e9rents arr\u00eats auxquels il est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 plus haut.\nJe cite ce passage du jugement re Audet, \u00e0 la page 302:\nIl ne manque pas d'arr\u00eats dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 que son obligation f\u00fbt solidaire avec son mari. Nous pourrions citer maintes et maintes causes o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable pour avoir sign\u00e9 des billets promissoires avec lui. Il suffira de rappeler le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de la Banque d'Hochelaga v. Jodoin (1895 A.C. 612). En cette affaire, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de madame Jodoin poursuivaient la Banque d'Hochelaga en revendication de certaines actions de compagnies transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la banque en garantie de billets promissoires \"signed by the husband in his own name and also in her name as her 'procureur' or attorney\".\nMadame Jodoin \u00e9tait donc oblig\u00e9e solidairement avec son mari. Elle fut condamn\u00e9e sur le motif que \"the whole affair was the wife's affair\u2026 The wife certainly had the benefit of the advances\".\nOn voit que le fait de solidarit\u00e9 n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 sa condamnation; l'existence de la solidarit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e suffisante pour entacher d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 l'obligation qu'elle avait contract\u00e9e.\nEt, encore, page 307:\nIl nous faut \u00e9carter de ce d\u00e9bat l'argument tir\u00e9 des nombreuses d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e, nonobstant le fait qu'elle s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e avec son mari, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable, lorsque l'obligation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e pour ses propres affaires ou, au moins, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle en avait retir\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. (N.B.\u2014La plus notoire est celle de la Banque d'Hochelaga v. Jodoin, d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e.) Tous ces jugements peuvent s'expliquer par le motif que ces cas ne tombent vraiment pas sous l'article 1301 du code civil. Cet article d\u00e9fend \u00e0 la femme de \"s'obliger\", et les codificateurs ne se sont pas expliqu\u00e9s sur le sens qu'ils donnaient \u00e0 ce mot dans leur projet. Mais, d'autre part, il r\u00e9sulte du passage de leur rapport que nous avons reproduit plus haut qu'en employant le mot \"obliger\", ils n'ont pas entendu introduire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard une innovation dans le code. Ils ont soin de d\u00e9clarer que la seule \"extension \u00e0 la loi\" dans leur projet est l'addition du mot \"avec\" aux mots \"pour son mari\". Or, il est conforme \u00e0 l'histoire de cette l\u00e9gislation, depuis le droit romain jusqu'aux statuts ant\u00e9rieurs au code, de comprendre, par l'expression \"s'obliger\" de l'article 1301 C.C., uniquement le cautionnement de la femme avec ou pour son mari\u2026 Il en r\u00e9sulte que l'obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e pour ses propres affaires ou pour son propre compte, qu'elle soit ou non commune avec son mari, n'\u00e9tant jamais, \u00e0 proprement parler, un cautionnement de sa part, ne constitue pas un acte o\u00f9 elle \"s'oblige\" au sens de l'article 1301 C.C. et ne tombe pas sous le coup de cet article.\nLe principe que l'engagement de la femme mari\u00e9e n'est pas nul, bien qu'elle se soit oblig\u00e9e avec son mari, s'il appara\u00eet qu'il a pour objet ses propres affaires, ou que la femme en a tir\u00e9 profit, est de jurisprudence constante. Cependant, pour les raisons que nous venons d'en donner, ce principe ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une exception \u00e0 l'article 1301 C.C. introduite par les tribunaux. C'est plut\u00f4t, dans chacun de ces cas, une constatation que l'obligation n'est pas un cautionnement et que, ne l'\u00e9tant pas, elle n'est pas couverte par l'article du code.\nEn plus, il est tr\u00e8s important de se rappeler que l'article 1302 du code civil suppose le cas o\u00f9 le mari \"s'oblige pour les affaires propres de sa femme\", et fournit donc un exemple d'une obligation de la femme avec son mari, qui n'est pas entach\u00e9e d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Comme nous le fait observer monsieur le juge Monk dans Mailhot v. Brunelle (1870, 15 L.C.J. 197): \"There is nothing in the law which prevents a wife from borrowing money. The mere circumstance of the husband being jointly and severally bound with the wife does not indicate that there is any illegality in the transaction. The wife cannot become security for her husband, except as \"commune en biens\"; but the husband may be jointly and severally bound with the wife where it is her debt.\nJe suis d'avis que, dans ce passage, le Juge Monk a exprim\u00e9 exactement la situation que nous avons \u00e0 envisager ici.\nIl s'agit, en effet, d'une dette exclusivement alimentaire. La somme que repr\u00e9sente le billet sur lequel poursuit l'appelante est pour le logement et la nourriture, pendant deux ans, de l'intim\u00e9e, ainsi que son mari et son enfant.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, comme l'\u00e9tablit abondamment le jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Kellock, l'obligation de l'intim\u00e9e de payer cette somme est d'une nature contractuelle.\nMais, ind\u00e9pendamment de cette raison, c'est une erreur de dire que le mari est seul tenu de l'obligation alimentaire des \u00e9poux et des enfants.\nL'article 173 place le mari et la femme sur le m\u00eame pied: \"Les \u00e9poux se doivent mutuellement fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, secours et assistance\". C'est donc une obligation mutuelle. Et, ant\u00e9rieurement, l'article 165 du Code avait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9: \"Les \u00e9poux contractent, par le seul fait du mariage, l'obligation de nourrir, entretenir et \u00e9lever leurs enfants\". L\u00e0, encore l'article ne dit pas le mari, mais \"les \u00e9poux\". Il serait, je pense, extraordinaire qu'une femme et son enfant puissent se loger et se nourrir dans un h\u00f4tel, pendant deux ans, et que la femme r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 se soustraire \u00e0 l'obligation de payer pour ces services.\nD\u00e8s lors, m\u00eame sans tenir compte du fait que, ainsi que le d\u00e9montre dans ses notes de jugement mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Kellock, le montant que repr\u00e9sente le billet, qui fait l'objet de l'action, a \u00e9t\u00e9 la dette personnelle de l'intim\u00e9e depuis le d\u00e9but, en vertu d'un contrat entre elle et l'appelante, il reste que c'\u00e9tait \u00e9galement sa dette en vertu du Code.\nA vrai dire, par suite des n\u00e9gociations entre le mari de l'intim\u00e9e et les autorit\u00e9s de l'appelante, l'on pourrait dire que l'intim\u00e9e est responsable, m\u00eame si son mari n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 son mandataire, parce qu'elle a donn\u00e9 tous les motifs raisonnables de croire qu'il l'\u00e9tait (C.C. 1730).\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, en vertu de l'article 1317 du Code Civil, \"La femme qui a obtenu la s\u00e9paration de biens doit contribuer, proportionnellement \u00e0 ses facult\u00e9s, et \u00e0 celles de son mari, tant aux frais du m\u00e9nage qu'\u00e0 ceux de l'\u00e9ducation des enfants communs. Elle doit supporter enti\u00e8rement ces frais s'il ne reste rien au mari\". A l'article qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l'on peut ajouter ce qui est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'article 1423 CC. \u00e0 l'effet que \"chacun des \u00e9poux contribue aux charges du mariage, suivant les conventions contenues en leur contrat, et s'il n'en existe point et que les parties ne puissent s'entendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le tribunal d\u00e9termine la proportion contributoire de chacune d'elles, d'apr\u00e8s leurs facult\u00e9s et circonstances respectives\".\nM\u00eame dans le cas des enfants naturels, du moment qu'ils sont reconnus par le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re, l'article 240 C.C. leur donne le droit de r\u00e9clamer des aliments contre chacun d'eux, suivant les circonstances.\nEt il est important de constater que, de l'aveu m\u00eame de l'intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame s'il s'agit d'une dette qui fait partie du passif de la communaut\u00e9, cette dette est en m\u00eame temps une dette personnelle \u00e0 la femme, qu'elle avait tout autant que le mari le droit de contracter pour elle-m\u00eame. Il n'y a jamais eu, que je sache, ni dans le Code Civil ni dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, un principe en vertu duquel la femme mari\u00e9e n'aurati pas le droit de contracter une obligation pour ses affaires personnelles. Ce que la preuve d\u00e9montrait ici, c'est que, non seulement le mari de l'intim\u00e9e n'avait pas de revenus, mais qu'il \u00e9tait m\u00eame insolvable. Dans ces circonstances, c'est sur la femme, qui avait des moyens, que l'obligation alimentaire retombait. Il n'y a pas \u00e0 se demander si le logement et les aliments qu'elle a elle-m\u00eame re\u00e7us \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel de l'appelante doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s par elle; cela va de soi. Mais, en vertu de la loi, telle que nous venons de l'exposer, c'\u00e9tait \u00e9galement elle qui devait acquitter le logement et les aliments fournis tant \u00e0 son mari insolvable qu'\u00e0 son enfant.\nDevant notre Cour, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 l'objection que la femme ne pouvait \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 l'obligation alimentaire, \u00e0 moins qu'un jugement interv\u00eent contre elle \u00e0 cet effet. Je ne vois rien dans la loi qui exige cela. C'est la premi\u00e8re fois que j'entends pr\u00e9tendre qu'une personne qui assume volontairement une dette n'est pas tenue de la payer avant d'y \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e par un jugement. Or, ici, dans les circonstances p\u00e9cuniaires de son mari, l'intim\u00e9e avait l'obligation naturelle de fournir les aliments et le logement \u00e0 son \u00e9poux, en vertu de l'article 173 C.C., et \u00e0 sa fille, en vertu de l'article 165 C.C. En signant le billet qui fait l'objet de l'action elle a tout simplement acquitt\u00e9 volontairement cette obligation naturelle. Si elle avait pay\u00e9 en argent, on ne pourrait s\u00fbrement pas pr\u00e9tendre que ce paiement serait nul et sans effet, en vertu de l'article 1301 C.C, et qu'elle aurait droit \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Ainsi que le dit l'article 1140 C.C.: \"La r\u00e9p\u00e9tition n'est pas admise \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des obligations naturelles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement acquitt\u00e9es\".\nEn fait, l'obligation de l'intim\u00e9e, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait plus qu'une obligation naturelle. C'est une obligation \u00e9tablie par la loi elle-m\u00eame. C'est une obligation l\u00e9gale, \u00e0 laquelle le Code Civil accorde un droit de poursuite contre celui qui doit des aliments, et, ici, cette obligation l\u00e9gale incombait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e tant pour elle-m\u00eame que pour son mari et pour sa fille.\nIl y a un jugement de la Cour de Cassation, rapport\u00e9 dans la Gazette du Palais, 1935, Volume 2, p. 934, \u00e0 l'effet que \"chacun des p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, naturels comme l\u00e9gitimes, est tenu pour le tout de l'obligation de nourrir, entretenir et \u00e9lever les enfants communs\" et que, \"cette obligation unique au regard des enfants qui en sont les cr\u00e9anciers en dehors de toute d\u00e9cision judiciaire consacrant leurs droits, ne s'en divise pas moins entre les parents qui dans leurs rapports entre eux doivent en supporter le poids proportionnellement \u00e0 leurs ressources\u2026 Toutefois, ajoute la Cour de Cassation, ledit recours (contre le parent d\u00e9faillant) serait sans cause si \u00e0 raison de son insolvabilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te l'obligation de ce dernier se trouvait \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre\".\nBaudry Lacantinerie (3e \u00e9d. \"Du Contrat de Mariage\", volume 18, Tome 3, n\u00b0 1490, p. 50) :\nChacun des \u00e9poux est personnellement tenu de l'obligation de subvenir aux d\u00e9penses des enfants communs, et que les tiers ont, de ce chef, non pas seulement l'action de l'article 1166, mais une action directe contre la femme, aussi bien que contre le mari, quel que soit le r\u00e9gime matrimonial adopt\u00e9\u2026 Les deux \u00e9poux sont tenus solidairement envers ces tiers.\nAu num\u00e9ro 1493, p. 54, le m\u00eame auteur ajoute:\nIl r\u00e9sulte de l'article 1448, que les conjoints, le mari comme la femme contribueront aux charges du (m\u00e9nage proportionnellement \u00e0 leurs ressources (cpr. art. 1537). Ceci pos\u00e9, si l'on imagine que l'\u00e9pouse ait pendant un certain temps, en cas de ruine, de son mari, sold\u00e9 toutes les d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage, puis, que ce dernier revienne \u00e0 meilleure fortune, pourra-t-elle, non seulement profiter d'une r\u00e9duction de sa contribution pour l'avenir, ce qui n'est pas douteux, mais encore exercer une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition contre son \u00e9poux? Il faut r\u00e9pondre non, du moins si elle n'a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 que ses revenus sans toucher \u00e0 ses capitaux; car lorsque le mari n'avait rien, la femme, en acquittant avec ses revenus personnels toutes les d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage y compris les frais d'\u00e9ducation des enfants, a sold\u00e9 sa propre dette. En une pareille occurrence, il n'y a place pour elle \u00e0 aucune r\u00e9p\u00e9tition.\nPlaniol & Ripert (Volume 8, n\u00b0 332, p. 374) se demandent si les cr\u00e9anciers peuvent poursuivre la femme en pareil cas. Ils r\u00e9pondent:\nS'il s'agit d'une obligation alimentaire mise par la loi \u00e0 la charge de la femme, on a affaire \u00e0 une dette qui est \u00e0 la fois commune et personnelle \u00e0 la femme: celle-ci peut donc \u00eatre poursuivie.\nEt les m\u00eames auteurs, au volume 9, n\u00b0 1015, p. 437, expriment l'avis:\nqu'il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 r\u00e9partition des charges, quand l'un des \u00e9poux ne poss\u00e8de rien et n'exerce aucune industrie lucrative. Cela est dit express\u00e9ment par l'article 1448, al. 2: si le mari, apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration judiciaire, est sans ressource aucune, la femme doit supporter toutes les charges du m\u00e9nage; mais la solution n'est pas sp\u00e9ciale au cas de s\u00e9paration judiciaire. La femme doit alors payer m\u00eame les d\u00e9penses personnelles du mari, et elle n'a aucune r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e0 exercer contre celui-ci. Il en serait de m\u00eame, dans la situation inverse, o\u00f9 ce serait la femme qui serait priv\u00e9e de ressources.\nIl peut donc arriver que le mari ou la femme ait \u00e0 supporter seul toutes les charges du mariage. Au titre des Personnes, Baudry-Lacantinerie (3e \u00e9d., volume 3, tome 3, n\u00b0 2001, p. 579) explique que l'obligation alimentaire na\u00eet en la personne de chacun des conjoints \"de telle sorte qu'il soit permis d'exiger directement de chacun l'accomplissement de la portion qui lui incombe\". Il ajoute :\nIl para\u00eet donc incorrect de dire que la m\u00e8re ne peut \u00eatre actionn\u00e9e que dans le cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 du mari, puisqu'elle lui abandonne tout ou partie de ses revenus pour subvenir aux charges du mariage, parmi lesquelles figurent les frais d'\u00e9ducation des enfants. En effet, les conventions matrimoniales peuvent bien r\u00e9gler la part contributoire des \u00e9poux dans l'acquittement de cette obligation. Mais elles ne sauraient les soustraire aux poursuites personnelles auxquelles son inex\u00e9cution les expose tous deux, sauf, s'il y a lieu, le recours de la femme contre son mari. D\u00e8s lors, par application de cette doctrine, les tiers doivent \u00eatre admis, m\u00eame durant la communaut\u00e9, \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer le paiement de ces frais tant \u00e0 la femme qu'au mari, mais pour une moiti\u00e9 seulement, si ce dernier est pleinement solvable.\nIl s'ensuit que, si le mari est insolvable, c'est \u00e0 la femme qu'incombe le paiement de ces frais et que les tiers sont admis \u00e0 le r\u00e9clamer d'elle seule.\nVoir encore, dans le m\u00eame sens, Dalloz (Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1890, premi\u00e8re partie, pages 337, 338, 339 et 340) ; Baudry-Lacantinerie (Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, 3e \u00e9d.\u2014Des Personnes\u2014vol. 3, tome 3, De l'Obligation Alimentaire, pages 612, 617, 620, 625, 643, 672, 673, 674 et 892).\nEt que la femme puisse \u00eatre poursuivie seule dans un pareil cas ressort des jugements du Juge Lafontaine dans Debien v. Dumoulin 19, confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision, dont le rapport se trouve au m\u00eame volume, p. 542; de Montminy v. Paquet 20 ; du Cours de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, de Colin & Capitant (7e \u00e9d., vol. 3, p. 268) ; du Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, de MM. Planiol & Ripert (Vol. 8, tome 1er, n\u00b0 289, p. 334) o\u00f9 ces auteurs disent:\nLa communaut\u00e9 n'est pas une personne morale mais une simple indivision: toute dette quelconque a n\u00e9cessairement pour origine le fait personnel de l'un des \u00e9poux, soit un fait ant\u00e9rieur au mariage, soit un fait post\u00e9rieur au mariage, mais ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 sa dissolution. Or, alors m\u00eame que la dette tombe en communaut\u00e9 et que pour ce motif, l'autre \u00e9poux s'en trouve d\u00e9sormais tenu en sa qualit\u00e9 d'associ\u00e9, celui du chef duquel la dette est n\u00e9e ne cesse pas d'en \u00eatre d\u00e9biteur pour le tout. D'o\u00f9 cette premi\u00e8re r\u00e8gle: les cr\u00e9anciers de la communaut\u00e9 demeurent cr\u00e9anciers du mari ou de la femme et ont toujours pour gage, en plus des biens communs, les propres du mari ou de la femme. Les dettes de communaut\u00e9 ne cessent donc pas d'\u00eatre des dettes personnelles. Voir encore Louis Josserand, dans son ouvrage intitul\u00e9: \"Cours de Droit Civil Positif Fran\u00e7ais\", 2e \u00e9d., tome 3, p. 10 (n\u00b0 15) et p. 64 (n\u00b0 110).\nM\u00eame dans la cause de Trust and Loan Company of Canada v. Gauthier 21 et avant l'amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 1301 C.C., pour prot\u00e9ger les cr\u00e9anciers qui ont contract\u00e9 de bonne foi, Lord Lindlay (p. 100) rendant le jugement du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9, avait dit:\nShe (la femme mari\u00e9e) clearly does not infringe art. 1301 by simply disposing of her own property with his concurrence under art. 177. If this is done for her own benefit, the disposition is good.\nL'intim\u00e9e, en signant le billet en vertu duquel elle est maintenant poursuivie, ne s'est nullement port\u00e9e caution pour son mari; elle a simplement reconnu son obligation naturelle et civile ou l\u00e9gale de pourvoir aux besoins de sa famille. S'il est vrai de dire que les prescriptions de l'artice 1301 sont d'ordre public, il l'est \u00e9galement de dire que, dans les circonstances de cette cause, l'obligation de l'intim\u00e9e de fournir les aliments \u00e0 son mari et \u00e0 sa fille \u00e9tait d'ordre public.\nEt, d\u00e8s qu'on en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la femme n'a fait rien autre chose que d'acquitter sa propre dette, il est strictement conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour, dans les diff\u00e9rents jugements qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de mes notes, de dire que l'article 1301 C.C. ne fait pas obstacle au droit de l'appelante de r\u00e9clamer le montant du billet.\nEnvisag\u00e9e seulement comme une obligation naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'intim\u00e9e, sa dette \u00e9tait une consid\u00e9ration suffisante, pour le billet qu'elle a sign\u00e9 en faveur de l'appelante, ainsi que cette Cour l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l'affaire de Hutchison v. The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning 22 et dans Pesant v. Pesant 23.\nJ'ai voulu exposer aussi compl\u00e8tement que possible les vues que j'entretiens sur le droit absolu de l'appelante de recouvrer de l'intim\u00e9e le montant du billet en cause. Mais, j'ajouterai que nous trouvons au dossier un argument qui, pour moi, est in\u00e9luctable et qui dispose de la pr\u00e9tendue objection \u00e0 l'effet qu'avant que l'intim\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 la dette alimentaire vis-\u00e0-vis de son mari il e\u00fbt fallu qu'elle f\u00fbt poursuivie et condamn\u00e9e. Je tiens \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter de nouveau que cette pr\u00e9tention est plut\u00f4t extraordinaire, vu que l'on ne poursuit quelqu'un que dans le cas o\u00f9 il ne consent pas volontairement \u00e0 acquitter son obligation. Or, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le billet en date du 20 juin 1939, pour le paiement duquel l'appelante a poursuivi l'intim\u00e9e, n'a fait que suivre et remplacer un autre billet consenti pour la m\u00eame dette et pour les m\u00eames fins, le 19 mai 1934. Ce premier billet \u00e9tait au montant de $3,776.97. Le billet actuel est pour $3,026.97. Certains acomptes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s sur le premier billet et le second repr\u00e9sente la balance.\nOr, le fait capital, c'est que le billet du 19 mai 1934 est sign\u00e9 uniquement par l'intim\u00e9e. Si l'appelante lui avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le montant de ce billet, l'intim\u00e9e n'eut eu aucune base pour invoquer l'application de l'article 1301 et refuser de le payer. En donnant ce billet sign\u00e9 par elle seule, elle reconnaissait vis-\u00e0-vis de l'appelante, s'il en \u00e9tait besoin, son obligation personnelle d'acquitter les cr\u00e9ances alimentaires de l'appelante contre elle, pour elle-m\u00eame, pour son mari et pour sa fille. Elle a donc reconnu la dette et il s'ensuit qu'en donnant, m\u00eame avec son mari, le billet du 20 juin 1939, non seulement elle ne s'est pas oblig\u00e9e avec ou pour son mari, suivant les exigences de l'article 1301 C.C., mais, au contraire, elle n'a fait qu'acquitter sa dette personnelle; c'est plut\u00f4t son mari qui s'est oblig\u00e9 \"pour les affaires propres de sa femme\", pour employer les termes m\u00eames de l'article 1302 du Code Civil.\nMais, toutes ces raisons ne viennent que s'ajouter \u00e0 celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 exprim\u00e9es par mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Kellock, et, comme lui, pour ces diff\u00e9rents motifs, de m\u00eame que ceux expos\u00e9s par M. le Juge St-Germain, dans son opinion dissidente en Cour du Banc du Roi, je maintiendrais l'appel ainsi que l'action de l'appelante contre l'intim\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014L'intim\u00e9e et son \u00e9poux, John Thomas Kelly, ainsi que leur jeune fille Kathleen, ont habit\u00e9 l'h\u00f4tel Place Viger \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante, depuis le 24 avril 1932 jusqu'au 19 mai 1934. Le compte hebdomadaire \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, aussi, M. et Mme Kelly ont-ils d\u00fb consentir plusieurs billets promissoires en reconnaissance de la cr\u00e9ance de l'appelante, dont le montant n'est pas contest\u00e9. Le 25 novembre 1933, un premier billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Mme Kelly, et endoss\u00e9 par M. Kelly, pour une somme de $3,742.79, et comme \u00e0 la date de leur d\u00e9part de l'h\u00f4tel, il \u00e9tait encore en souffrance, il fut renouvel\u00e9. Mme Kelly signa alors un nouveau billet, endoss\u00e9 par son mari, mais cette fois pour $3,776.97, la cr\u00e9ance ayant augment\u00e9 de $34.18. Le 20 janvier 1939, apr\u00e8s que deux acomptes de $375.00 chacun, soit $750.00, furent vers\u00e9s, un dernier billet fut consenti au montant de $3,026.97, sign\u00e9 conjointement et solidairement par M. et Mme Kelly, et c'est ce billet qui fait la base de la pr\u00e9sente action. M. le Juge en chef Tyndale de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accueilli cette r\u00e9clamation contre M. Kelly, mais l'a rejet\u00e9e quant \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, et la Cour d'Appel 24, avec la dissidence de M. le Juge St-Germain, a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Comme Kelly n'a pas appel\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, ni devant cette Cour, il se trouve \u00e0 y avoir chose jug\u00e9e quant \u00e0 lui.\n\u00c9tant mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que cette dette a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e personnellement par son mari, que c'est une dette de la communaut\u00e9, pour laquelle sa responsabilit\u00e9 n'est pas engag\u00e9e, et que c'est en violation des dispositions de l'article 1301 C.C. qui lui d\u00e9fend de s'obliger pour ou avec son mari, qu'elle a sign\u00e9 ce billet dont on lui r\u00e9clame maintenant le paiement.\nD'autre part, l'appelante soutient que le cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, riche h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de feu Hugh Quinlan, que sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle est engag\u00e9e, m\u00eame s'il s'agit d'une dette de la communaut\u00e9; et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, l'intim\u00e9e en signant ce billet n'a fait que reconna\u00eetre l'obligation l\u00e9gale de fournir \u00e0 son mari, incapable de se les procurer, et \u00e0 sa fille mineure, les aliments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie. Dans l'alternative, s'il ne s'agit que d'une obligation naturelle, celle-ci aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 convertie en obligation civile, susceptible de justifier la pr\u00e9sente action, par la signature du billet qu'elle a consenti avec son mari. Que l'obligation soit ex lege ou naturelle, l'article 1301 C.C. ne trouverait pas son application.\nIl est n\u00e9cessaire en premier lieu de d\u00e9terminer qui a contract\u00e9 cette dette vis-\u00e0-vis de l'appelante. A la lecture des t\u00e9moignages de M. et Mme Kelly, des employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie Cashman, Derouville et Cooper, il me semble qu'on ne peut entretenir de doute que c'est bien M. Kelly lui-m\u00eame qui a fait avec l'h\u00f4tel, les n\u00e9gociations pr\u00e9liminaires et les arrangements d\u00e9finitifs pour lui et sa famille. C'est d'ailleurs la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle est arriv\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s, confirm\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour d'Appel. M. le Juge en chef Tyndale s'exprime ainsi:\nThe Court can find nothing in the evidence to show even an implied contract with Mrs. Kelly. Consequently, the Court reaches the conclusion that Mrs. Kelly could not be held liable ex contractu.\nM. le Juge en chef L\u00e9tourneau, avec qui a concouru M. le Juge Casey, dit:\nJoignons \u00e0 cela que la demanderesse-appelante n'a nullement \u00e9tabli que cette dette repr\u00e9sente le billet, base de l'action, f\u00fbt en fait celle de la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e. L'ensemble de la preuve est \u00e0 l'effet que ni quant \u00e0 un engagement, ni m\u00eame quant \u00e0 un cr\u00e9dit, l'appelante n'a eu affaires \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Tout, \u00e0 ce sujet, s'est transig\u00e9 avec le mari.\nEnfin, M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9 est non moins explicite sur ce point:\nIl ne faut pas oublier, cependant, que dans ce cas-ci, la dette contract\u00e9e envers l'appelante l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 par le mari seul, sans aucune participation de l'\u00e9pouse.\nLes repr\u00e9sentations que le d\u00e9fendeur Kelly a pu faire sur la situation financi\u00e8re de son \u00e9pouse, les possibilit\u00e9s futures d'un substantiel h\u00e9ritage provenant de la succession Quinlan qu'il a sans doute fait miroiter, ont peut-\u00eatre induit l'appelante, non pas \u00e0 ouvrir le cr\u00e9dit, mais \u00e0 le prolonger. Mais tout cela ne peut lier l'intim\u00e9e qui est demeur\u00e9e \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux n\u00e9gociations, et n'a pas eu pour effet de cr\u00e9er entre elle et l'appelante des relations contractuelles entra\u00eenant sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de cette d\u00e9termination de faits, amplement justifi\u00e9e par la preuve, que la dette originaire \u00e9tait la dette du mari, et ainsi la dette de la communaut\u00e9, dont il est le chef, et l'unique administrateur. (C.C. 1292.) Que cette dette soit la dette de la communaut\u00e9, ne peut faire de doute, devant le texte pr\u00e9cis du Code (C.C. 1280, para. 5), qui est \u00e0 l'effet que les aliments des \u00e9poux, l'\u00e9ducation et l'entretien des enfants font partie du passif de la communaut\u00e9. Delorimier (Droit Civil, Vol. 2, page 129\u2014Citation de Pothier) (Laurent, Vol. 3, n\u00b0 4, Principe de Droit Civil) (Gregory & Odell 25), (Fuzier & Herman, Code Civil Annot\u00e9, Vol. 1, page 276) (C.C. 1371). Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 la dissolution de cette communaut\u00e9, que l'\u00e9pouse supportera sa part, mais si elle y renonce, elle n'aura aucune responsabilit\u00e9. M\u00eame dans le cas d'acceptation, elle ne sera tenue des dettes de la communaut\u00e9 que jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu'elle en retire, s'il y a eu un fid\u00e8le inventaire, et si elle a rendu compte de ce qu'elle a re\u00e7u. (C.C. 13701374.) Vide: Proulx v. La Caisse Populaire de Rimouski 26. Quand les parties sont mari\u00e9es sous un autre r\u00e9gime alors ce sont les articles 1317 et 1423 C.C. qui d\u00e9terminent leurs obligations respectives. (Fuzier & Herman, Code Civil Annot\u00e9, Tome 1, 1935, art. 203.)\nIl se pr\u00e9sente certes des cas o\u00f9 une femme commune en biens peut \u00eatre poursuivie conjointement avec son mari, mais il faut alors distinguer entre les dettes dont il s'agit. Si la dette est une dette personnelle de la femme, et est \u00e9galement devenue une dette de la communaut\u00e9, elle pourra \u00eatre poursuivie personnellement; mais si au contraire la dette ne lui est pas personnelle, mais est uniquement une dette commune, le mari, ma\u00eetre de la communaut\u00e9, seul pourra \u00eatre poursuivi.\nLa doctrine est bien expos\u00e9e par M. le Magistrat en chef Ferdinand Roy, dans la cause de Montminy v. Paquet 27, o\u00f9 il d\u00e9cide que la femme:\na) peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fenderesse, s'il s'agit d'une dette qui lui est personnelle, tout en \u00e9tant aussi une dette de communaut\u00e9;\nb) qu'elle ne peut \u00eatre poursuivie seule, puisqu'elle ne peut pas m\u00eame l'\u00eatre avec son mari, s'il s'agit d'une dette exclusivement de communaut\u00e9.\nDans Hudon v. Marceau28, la Cour d'Appel avait ant\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 :\n1. That a wife, \"commune en biens\", who purchases necessaries for the family of her husband and herself, only binds the community and in no way binds herself personally, unless she afterwards accepts the community, and then only to the extent of one half, or (where there is an inventory) to the extent she may have profited by the community.\nC'est aussi la doctrine des auteurs fran\u00e7ais. Ainsi, Baudry-Lacantinerie (Courtois & Surville) 3e \u00e9d., \"Du contrat de mariage\", Vol. 1, page 439, n\u00b0 499:\nNous verrons plus tard sur quels biens les tiers peuvent recouvrer ce qui leur est d\u00fb par le mari, et comment tout cr\u00e9ancier du mari a action tant sur les biens de l'\u00e9poux que sur les biens communs. N'insistons ici que sur ce seul point, \u00e0 savoir que les cr\u00e9anciers pour d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage n'ont pas d'action sur les biens de la femme. Pothier, \"Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9\", Vol. 7, n\u00b0 574, page 301 :\nA l'\u00e9gard des dettes auxquelles la femme ne s'est pas oblig\u00e9e en son nom, la femme et ses h\u00e9ritiers n'en sont pas tenus, m\u00eame envers le cr\u00e9ancier, quand m\u00eame ce seraient des dettes dont il pourrait sembler que la femme a profit\u00e9; telles que sont celles du boulanger, du boucher, du marchand qui a vendu les \u00e9toffes dont elle s'est habill\u00e9e. Denisart rapporte un arr\u00eat du 22 juillet 1762, qui a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une veuve qui avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, cong\u00e9 de la demande du boucher, pour fourniture de viande jusqu'\u00e0 la mort de son mari, en infirmant une sentence du Ch\u00e2telet qui avait fait droit sur la demade. (Denisart, verbo \"renonciation de la communaut\u00e9\", N\u00b0 26.)\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence sont m\u00eame all\u00e9es plus loin, et il est aujourd'hui unanimement admis que m\u00eame si la femme agit personnellement, et ach\u00e8te les n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s de la vie pour les besoins du m\u00e9nage, elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme mandataire de son mari, et ne peut \u00eatre tenue personnellement responsable. C'est une dette de la communaut\u00e9 pour laquelle seul le mari pourra \u00eatre recherch\u00e9. Cette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise dans la cause de Hudon v. Marceau (supra), et c'est aussi ce qu'enseigne Fuzier-Herman, Vol. 12, \"Communaut\u00e9 conjugale\", n\u00b0 941:\nAu lieu d'\u00eatre expr\u00e8s le mandat de la femme peut, disons-nous, n'\u00eatre que tacite. La th\u00e9orie du mandat tacite, admis par la plupart de nos anciens auteurs, est \u00e9galement accept\u00e9e aujourd'hui par la jurisprudence et la doctrine. Le principe du mandat tacite s'applique notamment, aux obligations contract\u00e9es par la femme pour subvenir aux besoins du m\u00e9nage. Ainsi la femme est cens\u00e9e avoir re\u00e7u mandat de son mari pour l'achat des aliments et autres fournitures du m\u00e9nage, les linges et v\u00eatements. Par suite les dettes contract\u00e9es pour l'acquisition de ces divers objets doivent \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9es par le mari et la communaut\u00e9 sans que la femme en soit tenue elle-m\u00eame.\nLaurent, (Vol. 21, n\u00b0 430, page 493) exprime ses vues de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nLorsqu'au contraire la femme contracte comme mandataire du mari, elle ne s'oblige pas personnellement, c'est le mandat qui s'oblige; c'est donc le mari qui est d\u00e9biteur et par cons\u00e9quent, la dette comme dette du mari, devient dette de la communaut\u00e9, sans que le cr\u00e9ancier ait action contre la femme, car les dettes de la communaut\u00e9 ne sont pas dettes de la femme; celle-ci n'est tenue que pour sa part quand elle accepte la communaut\u00e9, non comme d\u00e9bitrice personnelle,\u2014elle ne l'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9,\u2014mais comme femme commune.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il s'agit clairement d'une dette de la communaut\u00e9, pour laquelle seul le mari peut \u00eatre tenu. Il en est responsable \"ex contractu\" vis-\u00e0-vis l'appelante, et il le serait \u00e9galement si c'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 sa femme agissant comme son mandataire, qui l'eut contract\u00e9e. Il s'agit d'une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la vie dont la femme commune n'est pas responsable, m\u00eame si elle en a profit\u00e9.\nLes obligations du m\u00e9nage sont tellement la responsabilit\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9, qu'en vertu de l'article 1311 C.C., la femme peut demander la s\u00e9paration de biens, lorsqu'elle est forc\u00e9e de voir seule ou avec ses enfants aux besoins de la famille. En outre, lorsqu'en 1931 la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a amend\u00e9 le Code Civil pour donner une plus grande protection aux biens r\u00e9serv\u00e9s d\u00e9 la femme mari\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que les cr\u00e9anciers de la pourraient poursuivre le paiement de leurs cr\u00e9ances sur ces biens r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, mais seulement pour les dettes du m\u00e9nage. Il est \u00e9vident que cette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite dans la loi, parce que les dettes du m\u00e9nage sont une dette de la communaut\u00e9, et que par suite de la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation, la communaut\u00e9 \u00e9tant appauvrie jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence du montant des biens r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, ceux-ci devaient garantir les dettes de la masse, comme s'ils en faisaient encore partie. Il est bon de remarquer cependant, que cette l\u00e9gislation ne s'applique qu'aux biens r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire au produit du travail personnel de la femme, et non aux propres de l'\u00e9pouse qui se sont jamais entr\u00e9s dans la communaut\u00e9. (1425 (c) C.C.)\nLe billet sign\u00e9 conjointement et solidairement par les deux d\u00e9fendeurs n'est qu'une reconnaissance de cette dette, et n'a pas op\u00e9r\u00e9 de novation. En le signant, \u00e0 la demande de son mari, Mme Kelly s'est \"oblig\u00e9e pour ou avec son mari\" pour une dette de ce dernier, et comme le constate une jurisprudence uniforme, son acte est frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue, comme \u00e9tant une violation de l'article 1301 C.C. qui est d'ordre public. Cet article 1301 se lit ainsi:\nLa femme ne peut s'obliger avec ou pour son mari, qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute obligation qu'elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, (sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi).\nSur ce point, on pourra r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux causes suivantes: Lebel v. Bradin 29 ; Hamel v. Panet 30 ; Trust & Loan v. Gauthier 31 ; Joubert v. Turcotte 32 ; Laframboise v. Vali\u00e8res 33 ; Rodriguez v. Dostie 34 ; Poulin et Carette v. Banque Canadienne Nationale 35; Audette v. Banque Canadienne Nationale 36 ; Daoust Lalonde v. Ferland 37, enfin, \u00e0 la cause de Larocque v. Equitable Life Ins. Co.38, o\u00f9 le Tr\u00e8s Honorable Juge en chef T. Rinfret a fait une compl\u00e8te revue de la jurisprudence dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nL'article 1374 est \u00e0 l'effet que la femme qui, pendant la communaut\u00e9, s'oblige avec son mari, m\u00eame solidairement, est cens\u00e9e ne le faire qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune; en acceptant, elle n'est tenue personnellement que pour moiti\u00e9 de la dette ainsi contract\u00e9e, et ne l'est aucunement si elle renonce. Le r\u00e9sultat de ces deux articles combin\u00e9s, (1301 et 1374 C.C.), est que, si la femme est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, elle ne peut jamais s'obliger avec son mari, sauf pour ses affaires personnelles, mais si elle ne l'est pas, elle ne peut s'engager qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune, c'est-\u00e0-dire que, lors de la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9, elle sera responsable pour la moiti\u00e9 de la dette de la communaut\u00e9, et ne le sera pas si elle y renonce. Dans l'intervalle, avant que ne s'ouvre la communaut\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire avant sa dissolution, date o\u00f9 na\u00eetront ses droits et ses obligations, selon qu'elle acceptera ou refusera, elle ne peut \u00eatre poursuivie, car ce n'est pas elle qui a li\u00e9 la communaut\u00e9. Elle n'en a pas le droit.\nMais l'appelante pr\u00e9tend que l'article 1301 ne s'applique pas lorsque la femme s'oblige avec son mari comme cons\u00e9quence d'une dette \"ex lege\", ou d'une obligation naturelle, \u00e0 la merci de la conscience du d\u00e9biteur, mais qui se transforme en obligation civile, par la signature d'un billet promissoire qui a l'effet de nover la dette. Pour appuyer cette th\u00e9orie ing\u00e9nieuse sans doute, l'appelante cite les articles suivants du Code Civil:\n165. Les \u00e9poux contractent, par le seul fait du mariage, l'obligation de nourrir, entretenir et \u00e9lever leurs enfants.\n173. Les \u00e9poux se doivent mutuellement fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, secours et assistance.\nDans son factum, elle reproduit la d\u00e9finition que donnent Aubry & Rau (Vol. 4, Cours de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, page 5) de l'obligation naturelle:\nOn d\u00e9finit assez ordinairement les obligations naturelles en disant que ce sont celles qui d\u00e9rivent de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou de la conscience, ou bien encore celles qu'imposet la d\u00e9licatesse ou l'honneur. On a cit\u00e9 la cause de Pesant v. Pesant 39, pour \u00e9tablir qu'une obligation naturelle peut servir de consid\u00e9ration valide \u00e0 un billet promissoire. Cette proposition \u00e9videmment ne saurait laisser de doute dans l'esprit. Mais ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans cette cause, ne peut aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la pr\u00e9sente, o\u00f9 c'est un tiers qui r\u00e9clame.\nIl est possible et m\u00eame tr\u00e8s probable qu'en certains cas, une dette qui r\u00e9sulte de la loi, ou qu'une dette naturelle, qui est devenue une dette civile, puisse \u00eatre l'objet d'une obligation conjointe du mari et de la femme vis-\u00e0-vis un cr\u00e9ancier, sans qu'intervienne l'article 1301 C.C., pour la d\u00e9clarer nulle quant \u00e0 la femme. Mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer cette question car nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d'un d\u00e9biteur vis-\u00e0-vis un cr\u00e9ancier, \u00e0 qui serait due l'obligation l\u00e9gale ou naturelle mais bien en pr\u00e9sence d'un tiers qui voudrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier personnellement des relations l\u00e9gales ou naturelles qui existent entre le mari et la femme, et la m\u00e8re et sa fille, et qui d\u00e9coulent des articles 165 et 173 C.C.\nJ'entretiens des doutes s\u00e9rieux sur les droits que peuvent avoir les tiers d'invoquer \u00e0 leur profit les articles 165 et 173 C.C. Ces articles me paraissent plut\u00f4t d\u00e9terminer les relations entre \u00e9poux et entre les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et leurs enfants. C'est d'ailleurs ce que la Cour d'Appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Ainsi, parlant pour la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, Sir A. A. Dorion a dit dans Bruneau v. Barnes et vir 40 :\nQuant aux articles 165 et 173 du Code Civil, ils n'ont rien \u00e0 faire \u00e0 la question qui nous occupe.\nCes articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s dans les chapitres du Code qui traitent du mariage et des conventions matrimoniales pour r\u00e9gler les droits des conjoints entre eux, et non pour d\u00e9terminer les droits que les tiers pourraient avoir contre eux.\nLes \u00e9poux se doivent mutuellement secours et assistance, mais les tiers n'ont pas d'action pour obliger un \u00e9poux \u00e0 secourir l'autre, de m\u00eame qu'ils n'ont pas d'action pour forcer la femme \u00e0 supporter seule toutes les d\u00e9penses de la famille lors m\u00eame que le mari n'aurait rien.\nEntre les \u00e9poux et les enfants, il y a des obligations l\u00e9gales r\u00e9ciproques d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par les articles du Code, mais entre les \u00e9poux et les tiers il n'y a que celles qui r\u00e9sultent des conventions d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles expos\u00e9es au trait\u00e9 des obligations. D'autre part, dans une cause de Fecteau v. Brousseau 41, la Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un tiers peut r\u00e9clamer contre le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re d'un enfant quand il a accompli l'obligation de ces derniers. C'est parce qu'on a reconnu que ce tiers agissait en qualit\u00e9 de \"negotiorum gestor\" en pourvoyant \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation d'un enfant mineur aux lieu et place de son p\u00e8re. Mais tel n'est pas le cas qui nous est soumis, car il n'appara\u00eet nulle part que l'appelante ait volontairement assum\u00e9 la gestion d'affaires de monsieur ou de madame Kelly sans la connaissance de ces derniers. (C.C. 1043). Aucun quasi-contrat n'est intervenu entre les parties et l'appelante n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus la mandataire de l'intim\u00e9e, ce qui aurait peut-\u00eatre donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une action de mandat.\nM\u00eame en admettant, ce qui ne me para\u00eet pas probable, que les articles 165 et 173 du Code Civil conf\u00e8rent des droits aux tiers, encore faudrait-il que ces derniers soient dans les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour pouvoir r\u00e9clamer. Ils ne peuvent \u00e9videmment pas avoir plus de droits que ceux en faveur de qui sont \u00e9dict\u00e9s ces articles 165 et 173. Par analogie, on peut citer l'article 1031 du Code Civil qui, en certains cas, permet \u00e0 un tiers d'exercer les droits et actions de son d\u00e9biteur. Mais semblable action n'est ouverte \u00e0 un tiers que s'il peut d\u00e9montrer que son d\u00e9biteur a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d'exercer son recours. Comme le dit justement M. le Juge MacKinnon, parlant pour la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, dans la cause de Harris v. Royal Victoria Hospital 42 :\nI consider that the plaintiff, by its action as drawn, can get no comfort from these articles. It is clear that under article 1031 C.C. a creditor in order to avail himself of the rights and action of his debtor can only do so when to his prejudice the debtor neglects or refuses to do so. There is no allegation that defendant's mother-in-law has ever been put in default to exercise any claim she might have against her son-in-law or that she has neglected or refused to do so.\nIl me semblerait \u00e9trange qu'il appart\u00eent \u00e0 l'appelante dans l'esp\u00e8ce de faire d\u00e9clarer que le mari et la jeune fille ont droit de r\u00e9clamer des aliments de l'intim\u00e9e (condition essentielle \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de la pr\u00e9sente action), quand ceux-ci leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Kelly lui-m\u00eame, qui en est personnellement responsable et contre qui jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu. Comme le dit d'ailleurs mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Fauteux, il n'est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Kelly aurait eu le droit de r\u00e9clamer des taliments de son \u00e9pouse, et rien n'indique qu'elle ait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 de lui en fournir, ou qu'il fut incapable de travailler. L'inactivit\u00e9 n'a jamais donn\u00e9 ouverture \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation pour pension alimentaire.\nIl est bon, je crois, de signaler le danger qu'il y a dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, de s'inspirer des auteurs et des arr\u00eats des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais pour d\u00e9terminer les droits respectifs des parties. En effet, en France, l'article 1301 C.C. n'existe pas, et bien des opinions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9es qui sans doute ne l'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9, si en France, il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendu \u00e0 la femme de s'obliger pour ou avec son mari.\nPour r\u00e9sumer, je suis d'opinion que la dette originaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e par le mari, qu'elle \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence une dette de la communaut\u00e9, pour laquelle seul le mari pouvait \u00eatre poursuivi, et que quand l'intim\u00e9e a sign\u00e9 le billet promissoire dont on lui r\u00e9clame le paiement, elle s'est, en reconnaissant cette dette, \"oblig\u00e9e pour ou avec son mari\", en violation de l'article 1301 C.C. S'il fallait admettre la th\u00e9orie de l'appelante, qu'en souscrivant ce billet, Mme. Kelly remplissait une obligation \"ex lege\" ou naturelle qu'elle devait \u00e0 son \u00e9poux, et qu'elle en est responsable vis-\u00e0-vis la demanderesse, ce serait permettre \u00e0 celle-ci d'exercer indirectement un recours que la loi lui d\u00e9nie. Ce serait en outre conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 des tiers plus de droits contre l'un des \u00e9poux que ceux-ci n'en ont l'un vis-\u00e0-vis de l'autre. L'article 1301 C.C. a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 dans notre Code pour que le mari ne profite pas de son autorit\u00e9, et dissipe ainsi les propres de son \u00e9pouse, en exigeant d'elle la garantie de ses dettes. Cette l\u00e9gislation serait illusoire, et la protection accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la femme inefficace, si la pr\u00e9sente action devait \u00eatre maintenue.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je crois que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nKellock, J. (dissenting):\u2014The pertinent facts out of which this appeal arises are extremely simple.\nThe respondent, her husband and daughter, registered at the appellant's hotel in Montreal on April 24, 1932, the husband having previously telephoned with reference to the accommodation. A cheque of the respondent for $163.86, in payment of the account for the first week, which, like all accounts, was made out to the three who had signed the hotel register, was returned n.s.f. on May 13. The attention of Mr. Hooper, the appellant company's auditor, was drawn to the matter, and on his instructions one of his subordinates, Griffith, telephoned the respondent and asked her for payment of the cheque. Griffih's evidence, which was accepted by the learned trial judge, is as follows:\u2014\nQ. And what did she say?\u2014A. She simply said that it would be a matter of days before it would be taken care of.\nQ. She said that, did she?\u2014A. Yes, she said give her time and the cheque would be mailed.\nHooper himself testified that shortly after his attention had been drawn to the non-payment of the cheque, respondent's husband came in to see him, and the following occurred:\u2014\n\u2014A. And he told me that Mrs. Kelly was a daughter of the late Hugh Quinlan, and he proved to me that it was a very wealthy estate, and on the strength of this I allowed credit to Mrs. Kelly, but not to Mr. Kelly.\nQ. Did he speak to you about the Robertson case?\u2014A. Yes, he told me about the Robertson case. He said it was before the Court, and might be decided at any time, and which meant a great amount of money if they won, and they fully expected to win.\nQ. Did he speak to you about his own personal affairs? Did he give any reason why he could not pay the hotel bill?\u2014A. Well, Mr. Kelly told me he had been working in the Robertson case; that he had no occupation, that he had no assets, and that he had practically nothing. He gave me to understand that the account, if it was ever paid, would be paid by Mrs. Kelly.\nQ. Did he mention the fact that he owed money also?\u2014A. He told me he had some accounts\u2014I will not say that he told me, at that time, the names of the people he owed the accounts to, but it was mostly in Westmount, about $5,000.00. I think it was at that time.\nThis evidence is also accepted by the learned trial judge, who finds with respect to the evidence of the husband, who was called for the respondent, that\nKelly admitted in substance his interview with Hooper as recounted by the latter, and that the community between Mrs. Kelly and himself had had no assets since 1931.\nThe learned judge further finds that Kelly had \"no prospects\" and \"might almost be considered therefore as bankrupt.\"\nIn that state of affairs, the only means of the husband and wife from the day they first entered the hotel consisted of the interest of the respondent in the estate of her father, the late Hugh Quinlan. By the terms of the will of the latter, this interest was excluded from the community of property subsisting between the respondent and her husband.\nWhen the family took up residence at th\u00e9 hotel, the respondent was in receipt of a monthly income from the estate of $166, but she was entitled, on the death of her mother, which took place in fact in the following October, to a much larger income, and in addition to that, it was confidently hoped, as stated by Kelly in his interview with Hooper, that the litigation then proceeding between the estate and Robertson, who had been a partner of the testator in large undertakings, would produce a substantial increase in the assets of the estate and hence a corresponding increase in the income of the respondent. As the maintenance of the family at the hotel averaged in the neighbourhood of $465 per month, it is evident that the hotel, in allowing the family to remain, was extending credit on the basis not only of the respondent's actual income but of its increase. On the death of the respondent's mother on October 8, 1932, the income of the respondent increased to $6,500 in 1933 and $7,575 in 1934. The litigation with Robertson continued throughout the period.\nIn these circumstances, the first question which arises is the question as to whom credit was given. Hooper said, as above mentioned, that on the strength of his interview with Kelly, he had \"allowed credit to Mrs. Kelly but not to Mr. Kelly,\" and that \"after what he told me himself I could not possibly allow him any credit.\" No doubt this is not \"evidence,\" but I think, with respect, it merely states the only rational conclusion to which any ordinary business man would have come in such circumstances.\nOn the day they entered the hotel, husband and wife knew what the husband stated to Hooper, namely, that if the hotel \"was ever paid (it) would be paid by Mrs. Kelly.\" That being so, as honest people they must be taken to have themselves intended that it was the wife to whom credit would be given and by whom the liability would be incurred, and that the husband in his dealings with the hotel throughout was nothing but her mandatory. No doubt the hotel, not knowing the real situation when the family first arrived, would have been entitled to look to the husband, but the respondent was also liable; Article 1716. When the real situation was, however, disclosed to the appellant, the respondent alone became responsible; Article 1715. That the respondent fully understood the position is confirmed by the very first act which occurred with reference to the account, namely, her act in giving her cheque in payment followed by her request to Griffith for time to pay, and her promise to pay.\nIt is provided by s. 407 (3) of the Criminal Code that\nEvery person is guilty of an offence\u2026 who fraudulently obtains food, lodging or other accommodation at any hotel\u2026 ; and proof that a person obtained food, lodging or other accommodation at any hotel\u2026 and did not pay therefor and\u2026 knowingly made any false statement to obtain credit or time for payment, or offered any worthless cheque in payment\u2026 shall be prima facie evidence of fraud.\nIt is not to be presumed that either the respondent or her husband, when they entered the hotel, intended to defraud, or that the respondent, in what she said to Griffith, was stating other than her true intent. Nor is it to be presumed that Kelly, in stating to Hooper that if the appellant were to be paid at all it would not be by him but by the respondent, was stating other than a fact well understood by both him and his wife.\nWhen, therefore, the account having been allowed to run into a substantial figure on the strength of these facts, the respondent made the note of November 25, 1933, in favour of the appellant and her husband endorsed it, this again fully confirms the position as well understood by all concerned, namely, that she was the debtor, her husband being merely her surety, for whatever that might be worth.\nI am therefore, with respect, in this very plain situation, unable to accept or understand the finding of the learned trial judge, concurred in, as it was, by the majority in the Court of Appeal43, that there is\nnothing in the evidence to show even an implied contract with Mrs. Kelly.\nIn my view, St. Germain J., in his dissenting judgment, accurately assesses the position as follows:\u2014\nSi maintenant nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons \u00e0 la preuve, voici certains autres faits qui nous permettent de d\u00e9duire que dans toutes les relations du mari de la d\u00e9fenderesse avec la compagnie relativement \u00e0 la fourniture du logement et de la pension par ladite compagnie, tant au d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse et \u00e0 leur fille Kathleen, le d\u00e9fendeur a agi comme mandataire de son \u00e9pouse, et ce \u00e0 la connaissance et du consentement au moins tacite de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nOn May 19, 1934, a new note was taken, again signed by the actual debtor, the respondent, as maker, and again endorsed by Kelly as surety. On June 20, 1939, some payments having been in the meantime made, a new note was taken. This was signed by the respondent and Kelly jointly, but there is no evidence and no suggestion on the part of anyone that the previously existing relation between the parties was to be changed. It is well settled, of course, that the relationship as between joint makers of a promissory note may be shown to be that of principal debtor and surety; Greenough v. McClelland 44. The respondent in the present case remained the principal debtor and the husband the surety.\nThere is further express evidence that the respondent clearly understood the arrangement which had been made on her behalf by her husband as mandatary for her. At the time of the signing of the last note mentioned above, which is the note sued on, Griffith, who was present, testifies that on that occasion Kelly told him in the respondent's presence that\nwhen the money that was expected to accrue to Mrs. Kelly from the Quinlan estate would come, we could expect payment of our account.\nThis is the clearest corroboration of her recognition of her husband as her mandatary in his previous dealing with Mr. Hooper, and that she herself was the debtor.\nIn the present case, in my view, the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have not only failed to draw the proper inferences from the facts proved, but appear either to have overlooked completely or failed to give due weight to the evidence which I have set out above. Both courts appear to have stopped in their appraisal of the evidence at the mere fact that it was the husband who made the original reservations and his hand that made physical delivery of cheques or cash to the hotel. One would expect he would at least do that much, but that cannot determine with whom the hotel contracted once the real facts were disclosed to it. The present is one of those cases, in my view, which \"turn on inferences from facts which are not in doubt,\" to use the language of Lord Wright in Powell v. Streathan Manor 45. Lord Wright added:\nin all such cases the Appellate Court is in as good a position to decide as the trial judge.\nI am satisfied, with respect, that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses is not sufficient either to explain or justify his conclusion as above. In my opinion, it unmistakably appears from the evidence to which I have referred, that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses. The matter is therefore at large; Watt. Thomas 46, per Lord Thankerton at 587.\nI do not wish to part with the facts without refering to the disingenuous evidence of the respondent in her endeavour to put forward the pretence that everything done by her husband was completely detached from herself, while she, as she said, \"hoped he would pay\" the hotel.\nWhen called as a witness on her own behalf, the following rather leading question was put to her. I give her answer and some of what followed:\u2014\nQ. Mrs. Kelly, have you been able to save any money out of your houseekeping allowance?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Have you saved any money out of your personal earnings?\u2014A. No, I have never had any personal earnings.\nSubsequently, when put on the stand by the appellant, she said:\u2014\nQ. Mr. Cotton has asked you whether you have saved any money from your housekeeping allowance. Did you ever have any housekeeping allowance from your husband?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When was that?\u2014A. I cannot remember.\nQ. Was that during the last few years?\u2014A. No.\nQ. When would that be? Would you say, roughly, it would be ten years ago?\u2014A. I really cannot remember.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nQ. Did your husband give you any personal allowance when you were living at .the Place Viger Hotel?\u2014A. Yes, he often gave me money.\nQ. How much did he give you?\u2014A. I do not know; he did not give me any special allowance.\nQ. You do not remember whether he gave you five or ten dollars per month?\u2014A. I cannot remember.\nQ. Would it be about that?\u2014A. He did not give me any special amount. Q. You had no regular monthly allowance from your husband?\u2014A. No.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nQ. You said that your husband gave you an allowance?\u2014A. I did not say that he gave me an allowance, I said that he often gave me money.\nQ. Do you know whether that money was out of your own cheques which you gave him in blank?\u2014A. I really never asked him.\nQ. It might have been?\u2014A. I do not know. I did not ask him.\nAs to the suggestion that she entertained any idea that her husband could pay, I quote the respondent as follows:\u2014\nQ. Where did you expect your husband to get the money to pay off the notes if you knew that he had judgments outstanding against him?\u2014A. Do I have to answer that question?\nMr. Cotton: I will object to that question.\nThe Court: I will allow the question.\nA. Well, as far as I know, he always said he would have the money; I do not remember him telling me where he was going to get it.\nMr. Pr\u00e9vost: You hoped that he was going to get it somewhere, some way?\u2014A. He told me he would get it.\nThe Court: Did he tell you where he would get it?\u2014A. No, he did not.\nMr. Pr\u00e9vost: You do not know, or you did not know where your husband was working, or how much he was earning?\u2014A. No, I did not.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nQ. Did you know that your husband, at the time, had judgments against him?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You knew that?\u2014A. Yes.\nWith evidence of this character the courts are very familiar. Such evidence admits what it is intended to deny. It should not deceive anybody, nor distract attention from the conclusion with which the really significant facts are pregnant. I agree fully with the view of St. Germain J. as to the respondent's evidence when he said:\u2014\nLes r\u00e9ticences dans les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par la d\u00e9fenderesse aux questions qui lui sont pos\u00e9es d\u00e9montrent, \u00e0 mon humble avis, une enti\u00e8re mauvaise foi de sa part.\nBefore considering the result in law, it is necessary to refer to certain other evidence given by the husband. The record of the account shows that on November 2, 1932, the sum of $2,000 was paid to the hotel, and on June 30 and July 31, 1934, payments of $375 each were also made. When called as a witness for the respondent, Kelly claimed that these sums had been paid out of his own funds. Although he admitted that he had had no bank account, he claimed that he had deposited moneys of his own in the account of his wife and that, from time to time, she gave him cheques on that account signed by her in blank.\nOn being cross-examined as to this story, Kelly stated that in 1932 he had received $10,000 from the Northern Construction Company which he said he had earned in connection with the negotiating for that company of a construction contract, and that he had borrowed an additional $5,000 by way of discount of a note which a friend had given to him.\nHe testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. And when you went to the Place Viger Hotel in April 1932, you had severed your connection with the firm you spoke of, the Northern Construction Company?\u2014A. I never was working or associated with them; I just negotiated this one contract.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nQ. Now, referring to that $10,000.00. When you arrived at the hotel, in April 1932, did you still have that money?\u2014A. No, I had not received it all, I had received some of it previously, in fact I received some more while I was at the hotel. As to the exact amount I would have to check that up, but I think that I received $7,000.00, and then I received $3,000.00 previous to that. At the time I would say that I had approximately $7,000.00.\nThis answer is not entirely unambiguous, but it is at least plain that the alleged negotiation of contract by which the money was said to have been earned, had taken place prior to the time the family went to the hotel on April 24, 1932. If this story be, for the moment, taken at face value, what is said is that on April 24, Kelly was in funds to the extent of some thousands of dollars. He himself, however, furnishes the refutation, in that he also deposed that during this same period he had no bank account of his own but had used that of his wife. The evidence with respect to this account is in the record and it discloses that on May 7, when the respondent gave her first cheque to the hotel in the sum of $163.86, there were not sufficient funds in the account to meet it. Comment would appear to be unnecessary. Further, Kelly's story is completely contradicted by his statement to Hooper, which the learned judge accepts as representing his true position at the time, namely, that he had \"no assets\" and \"no prospects\".\nIn stating, therefore, that Kelly's evidence at trial with respect to these alleged funds was uncontradicted, the learned judge overlooked this direct contradiction of Kelly himself and his own finding. Kelly himself did not attempt an explanation. If it be a fact that Kelly was able subsequently to induce a friend to give him a note which Kelly was able to discount, that is quite irrelevant to the issues here in question, as no such possibility entered into the considerations placed before Mr. Hooper when the appellant agreed to give credit.\nIt is a fact that $2,000 was paid on the account on November 2, 1932. As already observed, the respondent's mother had died on October 8 previously, resulting in a large increase in the income to be received by the respondent. This fact may not be unconnected with the ability of the husband to induce a friend to lend the money, but however that may be, all of this is completely irrelevant, in my view, with respect to the question as to the person with whom the hotel contracted in the previous May, for all of it was quite unknown to the hotel and was not even in \"prospect\" so far as Kelly himself was concerned. The same applies to the two payments of $375 each in June and July, 1934. Accordingly, I do not pursue the subject further. The fact that the appellant took judgment against Kelly contributes nothing to the discussion. He became liable as surety on the very first note, as already pointed out.\nThe defence put forward on behalf of the respondent and given effect to below was that, being common with her husband as to property, the liability for maintenance of husband and family is thrown once and for all by Article 1280 (5) upon the community, and that by reason of Article 1301, the respondent was unable to contract the debt here in question. The argument is that the liability placed upon a married woman by Articles 165 and 173 is satisfied under all circumstances in the case of a married woman common as to property, by the mere fact of the community itself, regardless of the fact as to whether or not the community or the husband have any assets, or whether or not the wife herself has assets. If sound, it would follow from this proposition that in the case of a husband and wife common as to property, even if the former be insolvent while the latter has substantial assets, the wife is under no legal obligation to provide for either her husband or children. It is said that the only alternative to starvation so far as the position at law is concerned is that the husband, if able-bodied, can go to work at some employment. What the children are to do in the meantime the argument does not say. Such a contention would seem to require careful consideration.\nBy Article 165, husband and wife come under an obligation, by the mere fact of marriage, to maintain their children. By Article 169, however, maintenance is only granted in proportion to the needs of the party claiming and the means of the parent, while Article 170 makes it clear that if the parent has no means he is discharged from all liability to maintain. It is further provided by Article 173 that husband and wife owe each other mutual succour and assistance, and Article 175 obliges the husband to supply his wife with all necessaries of life \"according to his means and condition.\"\nSo far as these Articles are concerned, it would seem to follow, from their plain language, that where a husband has no means and, accordingly, in the words of Article 1311 (3), \"the wife is forced to provide alone\u2026 for the wants of the family\" in fact, she has also the sole legal obligation to do so. For myself, I see no ground upon which one is to be driven to the view that this obligation, placed upon all married women, is to be taken as satisfied from the day of her marriage, in the case of a woman common as to property, by mere reason of the fact that Article 1280 (5) includes maintenance of the family among the liabilities of the community.\nArticles 165 and 173 are not, in terms, limited to regimes other than the regime of community, and to construe 1280 (5) in the way above suggested would be to introduce an exception into these Articles which the legislature has not placed there. In my opinion, no such limitation is to be read into either of these Articles, and that being so, it cannot be said that a married woman common as to property, who finds herself, to use again the language of Article 1311 (3), \"forced to provide\u2026 for the wants of the family,\" is precluded by the terms of Article 1301 from carrying out her obligation in the only way which, at times, may be open to her, namely, by pledging her credit. In view of the co-existence in the Code of all these Articles, the provisions of Article 1301 are to be limited to cases where a wife incurs an obligation not already binding in law upon her. With respect, the contrary view accepts, without looking farther, such statements as that in Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Vol. 8, para. 736, where, in commenting on Article 203 C.N. which corresponds to Article 165 of the Civil Code, the author says:\u2014\nElle doit \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e par le mari sous le r\u00e9gime de communaut\u00e9; \u2026elle est acquitt\u00e9e dans la proportion fix\u00e9e par la loi\u2026\nThis paragraph, however, is immediately followed by para. 737 which reads as follows:\u2014\nSi l'un des \u00e9poux est dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire \u00e0 cette charge, ou ne peut y satisfaire que partiellement, elle incombe \u00e0 l'autre int\u00e9gralement ou dans la mesure o\u00f9 son conjoint ne peut la supporter.\nAmong the authorities referred to in support of the last mentioned paragraph is the judgment of the Cour de Cassation of the 21st of May, 1890, reported in Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale 1890, p. 337, which also reproduces the comment upon the judgment by M. de Loynes of the Faculty of Law of Bordeaux.\nThe case referred to was that of a claim by a third person for the maintenance of a child of the defendant husband and wife, common as to property. It was there held that the obligation created by Article 203 was a liability of each of the spouses and that the third party had an action even during the community against the wife as well as against the husband.\nIn his comment upon this judgment, M. de Loynes says at p. 338:\u2014\nIl est m\u00eame un cas dans lequel, comme nous venons de le rappeler, l'un des \u00e9poux doit supporter toute la dette, et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 pour le tout, c'est lorsque l'autre \u00e9poux est insolvable. Alors la dette se transforme; elle cesse d'\u00eatre une dette conjointe; il n'y a plus qu'un seul d\u00e9biteur.\nIn Gibeau v. Varin 47, it was held again by the Cour de Cassation that the obligation to maintain their children rests upon both parents. If one has discharged more than his proper share, the other must contribute, except in the case of the insolvency of the latter. As there stated,\nAttendu\u2026 qu'il suit de l\u00e0 que, si l'un d'eux s'est soustrait \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ce devoir \u00e0 la fois l\u00e9gal et moral, vis-\u00e0-vis des enfants hors d'\u00e9tat de se prot\u00e9ger eux-m\u00eames, celui qui en a forc\u00e9ment assum\u00e9 la charge a, en principe, un recours contre le d\u00e9faillant; Attendu toutefois que ledit recours serait sans cause si, \u00e0 raison de son insolvabilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te, l'obligation de ce dernier se trouvait \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre ;\nAccording to these authorities, there is no basis for reading into Article 165 any exception in the case of a married woman common as to property. If the community and the husband have no assets, but the wife has, she is liable, just as in the case of a woman separate as to property, for the entire maintenance of the children. In such circumstances, the obligation of the husband has disappeared, not only with respect to the maintenance of the children, but also with respect to that of the wife, this latter liability of the husband being conditioned upon his means; Article 175. The wife also becomes liable for the entire support of the husband; Article 173.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, Article 1301 can have nothing to say in the case of an obligation placed upon the wife by other sections of the Code, and must be limited, as I have already pointed out, to cases where she is under no such liability. As pointed out by their Lordships in Gauthier's case 48, the object of Article 1301 is to protect a wife against her husband and herself. It can have no application, therefore, where she is contracting for the purpose of carrying out an obligation which the law itself has already placed upon her. It is obvious that one of the ordinary ways in which a married woman, or anyone else, could carry out such an obligation would be by the pledge of her credit.\nThe authorities cited above further show that a married woman common as to property is, in the circumstances described, liable to an action at the suit of third parties. If that be so, there is all the more reason for saying that she may contract for the maintenance for which she may in any event be sued, not only by her husband and children, but also by third parties. Articles 1031 and 1043 recognize that third parties have a right of action whether or not they have also the right to sue directly under Articles 165 and 173. It matters not that in the case at bar the action is not founded on either of these Articles. The point is that the Code itself recognizes that a liability exists. The view of the Court of Queen's Bench in Bruneau v. Barnes 49, with respect to the right of action of creditors under Articles 165 and 173, would appear to be out of harmony with the authorities to which I have referred and was given without any discussion of the authorities. It appears also to take no account of other provisions of the Code such as Articles 1031 and 1043. The actual decision has no application to the case at bar, as the debt in the case was purely a debt of the husband alone.\nWhere the liability of the husband has disappeared, a wife, in contracting for food and lodging for herself and family is not binding herself either \"with\" her husband or \"for\" him. In truth she is simply dealing with her own property for her own responsibility. In a case such as the case at bar, where, owing to lack of means on the part of a husband, the wife is thrown upon her own resources, she is free to provide for herself as she sees fit and to pledge her children also, she keeps them with her and in so doing goes beyond that which could be demanded of her in the way of provision if she were being sued by them, this is again a matter of her own responsibility. The husband being without means and, therefore, having no liability towards wife or children, her contracts in connection with the maintenance of herself and children are matters to which Article 1301, even upon its litteral terms, cannot apply.\nWhere the husband is in need, the wife is bound to succour him, and where that obligation exists, Article 1301 can have no application to contracts entered into by her in furtherance of an obligation placed upon her by the Code itself. She is certainly entitled, if husband and wife so desire, to provide for him in the same establishment which she has set up for herself and their common children. In this connection it is to be remembered that the measure of the liability under consideration, once the need is established, is the means of the person liable. As pointed out in Planiol & Ripert, Tome 2, \u00e9dition 1925, \"Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais\", p. 31,\nun changement dans la situation de fortune du d\u00e9biteur pourra avoir pour cons\u00e9quence de faire mettre la pension \u00e0 un taux sup\u00e9rieur\u2026 It is clear on the authorities, also, that mere physical capacity on the part of the husband to do some kind of work does not affect the matter.\nIn dealing with Article 208 (C.C. 169) which provides that maintenance is only granted \"dans la proportion du besoin\" of the person claiming, Planiol & Ripert, in the volume to which I have just referred, state at p. 25 that the need of a person ought to be appraised according to the income of such person, whatever its origin, rather than on the basis of the value of his property. They go on to say that an individual who can provide for himself by working, has no claim for support, although he has no property, and that it is not even necessary that such profitable employment be exercised in fact if its exercise be \"possible\". The exact statement of the authors is as follows:\u2014\nLe besoin d'une personne doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les revenus qu'elle a, quelle qu'en soit l'origine, et non d'apr\u00e8s la valeur de ses biens. Un individu qui peut se procurer de quoi vivre en travaillant n'a pas droit \u00e0 des aliments, quoiqu'il n'ait pas de biens; il n'est pas m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire que cette profession lucrative soit exerc\u00e9e en fait, il suffit que son exercice soit possible.\nIn support of the text, the authors refer in the first place to a judgment of the Cour de Cassation of the 7th of July, 1863, Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale 1.400. In that case, the Paris court had refused the claim of a son against his father and mother for maintenance, it appearing that the main cause for the position of want in which the son found himself was his \"instabilit\u00e9 dans les divers emplois qu'il a occup\u00e9s, ses habitudes de d\u00e9sordre et d'oisivet\u00e9, sa r\u00e9pugnance \u00e0 s'employer utilement pour lui-m\u00eame\". This decision was upheld by the Cour de Cassation on the same grounds.\nThe authors also refer to the judgment of one of the Cours Imp\u00e9riales of the 15th of December, 1852, reported in Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1853, 2.88, where a similar claim was rejected on the ground that the claimant was in a position to provide for himself by carrying on his former employment if he were so minded.\nIt is clear, therefore, from the above that where a claimant is in a position to maintain himself by his own efforts but for some fault of his own, he may not enforce a claim for maintenance. Planiol & Ripert, in the same paragraph, go on to say that, conversely, an individual, although in possession of substantial property but from which he receives no income, is still entitled to maintenance, and that the person obliged to provide such maintenance cannot avoid his obligation by saying that the claimant should sell his property and thereby provide himself with revenue. The authors add the significant sentence that \"le besoin du cr\u00e9ancier consiste dans le manque actuel de revenus. Il faut toutefois qu'il n'y ait dans ce cas aucune faute \u00e0 ne pas ali\u00e9ner les biens improductifs\".\nIt has not been shown in the case at bar that the husband's lack of means was in any way due to fault on his part. Nothing of the kind was argued on behalf of the respondent who, in maintaining her husband in the common m\u00e9nage with herself and her children, lived up to her legal obligation to him and, at the same time, kept the family circle unbroken.\nTo my mind, the suggestion that Article 1301 is to be construed as prohibiting contracts by a wife for such purpose, and that she is under legal obligation, whatever her means, to force her husband to the street so long as he is able, from the physical standpoint, to do some kinds of work, is something which, with respect, I cannot think the provincial law, with its regard for family life, ever contemplated. In any event, I find nothing in the Article in question which compels such a view. On the contrary, I think the relevant provisions of the Code taken as a whole, as well as the authorities to which I have referred, dictate a contrary conclusion. In such case as that here under consideration, the wife is acting neither with nor for her husband, but for her own responsibility.\nIn Moha v. Genis 50, it was held that a married woman, common as to property, was liable for the rent of an apartment which had been demised to the husband, he having thereafter become insolvent and left his wife. The court held that it made no difference that the wife had not entered into the lease and therefore was not liable in contract. The landlord could sue her under the provisions of Article 203.\nIn a learned comment on this judgment, M. Raynaud of the Faculty of Law of Toulouse criticizes the judgment on the ground that as the husband was no longer living in the apartment with his wife but had established a separate abode of his own, there could be no liability on the part of the wife to the husband under Article 203, as he had no need. Had the consorts been living together, however, the learned author would have considered the judgment correct.\nM. Raynaud, in his commentary, deals with the effect of Articles 203 and 212 (165 and 173 C.C.) both as between the spouses themselves as well as with regard to third parties. He denies that a wife, common as to property, is forever acquitted of her liability toward her husband and her children by the mere fact of community where, as in the case at bar, she has personal assets. He says:\u2014\nNul ne pourrait raisonnablement soutenir qu'une femme ayant des biens personnels importants soit en droit de laisser p\u00e9rir de faim un mari insolvable, sous pr\u00e9texte qu'elle s'est acquitt\u00e9e de sa contribution. Lorsque celle-ci s'av\u00e8re pratiquement insuffisante ou que le r\u00e9gime matrimonial ne fonctionne pas, par exemple par suite de la s\u00e9paration de fait des \u00e9poux, l'obligation alimentaire entre \u00e9poux, qui rev\u00eat la forme du devoir de secours, repara\u00eet parce qu'elle n'est pas remplie. Si le contrat de mariage peut am\u00e9nager \u00e0 la guise de ses auteurs la contribution des conjoints aux charges de la vie du foyer, il ne saurait dispenser un des \u00e9poux de l'obligation de secours qui est certainement d'ordre public ni en diminuer l'intensit\u00e9. Il se peut que la femme ait rempli compl\u00e8tement le devoir que lui impose le r\u00e9gime matrimonial de participer aux frais du m\u00e9nage, cela ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement qu'elle en est quitte avec le devoir de secours.\nL'obligation alimentaire peut donc ne pas \u00eatre satisfaite par le jeu du r\u00e9gime matrimonial qui normalement envisage et assure son ex\u00e9cution par la contribution des \u00e9poux aux charges communes, les articles 203 et 212 ont alors une occasion de s'appliquer directement pour assurer l'accomplissement du devoir de secours.\nThe truth is that the obligation cast upon the community by Article 1280 (5) does not exhaust the liability of the wife, there being always in the background the liability created by Articles 165 and 173 so that where neither the community nor the husband has any assets, but the wife has, she must support the family on the footing of these Articles.\nIn concluding that the creditors themselves as well as the children and the husband may prefer a claim directly against the wife under Articles 203 and 212 (165 and 173 C.C.), M. Raynaud summarizes his conclusions as follows:\nEn r\u00e9sumant ce que nous venons de dire nous pourrons appr\u00e9cier notre arr\u00eat. En cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 du mari ses cr\u00e9anciers peuvent poursuivre directement la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens dans la mesure de la part contributive de celle-ci, lorsqu'ils se pr\u00e9valent d'une dette m\u00e9nag\u00e8re; ils peuvent aussi r\u00e9clamer paiement \u00e0 la femme, quel que soit le r\u00e9gime matrimonial adopt\u00e9, dans la mesure de la dette alimentaire de celle-ci, \u00e0 condition que la fourniture ait un caract\u00e8re non seulement m\u00e9nager, mais alimentaire. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est sur ce dernier terrain seulement que pouvait se rechercher une justification de la condamnation de la femme.\nThe view to which I have come was earlier expressed by Boyer J. in an earlier phase of this litigation reported in 79 K.B. 121. That learned judge, after referring to Gauthier's case, said at p. 122:\u2014\nLa dette encourue pour la subsistance du mari et de la femme et de leur enfant est bien une dette de la communaut\u00e9, mais d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 173 C.C., les \u00e9poux se doivent assistance mutuelle et ils sont tous deux tenus \u00e0 nourrir et entretenir leurs enfants d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 165 C.C., et lorsque le mari est sans moyens et ne gagne rien et que l'\u00e9pouse a les moyens d'y subvenir et c'est le cas ici, cette obligation lui est personnelle et elle peut s'engager avec le concours de son mari, art. 177 C.C., comme elle l'a fait dans les circonstances.\nOn a cit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents arr\u00eats de part et d'autres rendus presque tous avant l'amendement et pour la plupart des jugements d'esp\u00e8ce, mais il ne s'agit pas d'appliquer strictement la lettre de la loi, il faut aussi en consid\u00e9rer l'esprit et le but.\nLe but, dans ce cas, est de prot\u00e9ger la femme qui, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ne conna\u00eet point les affaires et subit trop facilement l'influence du mari, m\u00eame au point de sacrifier ses int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nOr, l'appliquer \u00e0 la lettre dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait pas \u00e0 la femme, mais lui nuirait en l'emp\u00eachant d'obtenir les choses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie. Car alors personne ne voudrait la nourrir et loger par crainte de n'\u00eatre pas pay\u00e9 ou de se voir r\u00e9clamer la pension d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9e.\nD'ailleurs, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ce n'est pas la femme qui s'est engag\u00e9e avec son mari, mais le mari qui s'est engag\u00e9e avec sa femme, car aucun cr\u00e9dit n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 au mari et rien n'emp\u00eache le mari de s'engager pour ou avec sa femme.\nAu surplus, la demanderesse, non seulement, \u00e9tait de bonne foi, mais le logement et la nourriture ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse elle-m\u00eame et \u00e0 ceux pour lesquelles elle \u00e9tait responsable.\nAccordingly, as I have said, Article 1301, in my view, has no application in such a case as the present where the respondent was, in the circumstances, bound in law to provide for her family.\nI have not overlooked that part of the account which was for guests. All items of this character were authorized by the husband, who told the appellant's employee that \"we\" would be responsible. This the appellant accepted. Such items were all incurred after May 1932, and I think that on the evidence to which I have referred, the appellant was entitled to rely on the husband as having the authority from his wife which he purported to have and which she recognized in the manner I have already indicated. In the foregoing I have not specifically referred to authorities cited by the respondent in support of the contention put forward on her behalf that the consideration for the original note was solely a liability of the community for which the respondent was not personally responsible.\nIn his factum, counsel for the respondent cites from Baudry-Lacantinerie (Courtois & Surville) 3rd edition, \"Du contrat de mariage\", Vol. 1, p. 439, as follows:\u2014\nNous verrons plus tard sur quels biens les tiers peuvent recouvrer ce qui leur est d\u00fb par le mari, et comment tout cr\u00e9ancier du mari a action tant sur les biens de l'\u00e9poux que sur les biens communs. N'insistons ici que sur ce seul point, \u00e0 savoir que les cr\u00e9anciers pour d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage n'ont pas d'action sur les biens de la femme.\nThe authors are, however, speaking here only of the liability imposed on the community by Article 1409 (5) C.N., 1280 (5) C.C., and are not dealing with the case of insolvency of one of the spouses. The situation, of course, is quite clear where that element is not present. In Baudry-Lacantinerie (Houques-Fourcade) \"Droit Civil\", Vol. 3, p. 577, Article 1997, where the authors are dealing with the obligation with respect to the education of the children, it is stated:\u2014\nQuant aux parents l\u00e9gitimes, ces frais constituent une des charges du mariage. Elle doit, comme telle, \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux stipulations des conventions matrimoniales, c'est-\u00e0-dire par la communaut\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale (art. 1409-5)........ Mais ces frais retombent toujours \u00e0 la charge d'un des \u00e9poux dans toute la mesure o\u00f9 l'autre ne peut pas les supporter, quelles que soient sur ce point les dispositions de leur contrat de mariage.\n2001. Mais, si l'obligation n'est ni solidaire, ni m\u00eame in solidum, du moins na\u00eet-elle en la personne de chacun des conjoints, de telle sorte qu'il soit permis d'exiger directement de chacun l'accomplissement de la portion qui lui incombe. Il para\u00eet donc incorrect de dire que la m\u00e8re ne peut \u00eatre actionn\u00e9e que dans le cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 du mari, puisqu'elle lui abandonne tout ou partie de ses revenus pour subvenir aux charges du mariage, parmi lesquelles figurent les frais d'\u00e9ducation des enfants. En effet, les conventions matrimoniales peuvent bien r\u00e9gler la part, contributoire des \u00e9poux dans l'acquittement de cette obligation. Mais elles ne sauraient les soustraire aux poursuites personnelles auxquelles son inex\u00e9cution les expose tous deux, sauf, s'il y a lieu, le recours de la femme contre son mari. D\u00e8s lors, par application de cette doctrine, les tiers doivent \u00eatre admis, m\u00eame durant la communaut\u00e9, \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer le paiement de ces frais tant \u00e0 la femme qu'au mari, mais pour une moiti\u00e9 seulement, si ce dernier est pleinement solvable. The respondent also quotes from Planiol & Ripert, Vol. 8, p. 374, No. 332 last part, as follows:\u2014\nS'il s'agit du contraire de l'entretien de la femme qui incombe personnellement au mari (art. 214 C.N., 175 C.C.) ou les d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage, on admet en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que les dettes contract\u00e9es par la femme ne peuvent \u00eatre poursuivies contre elle, la femme agit comme mandataire du mari.\nIt will be observed that the authors state the above to be true \"in general.\" Earlier in the same paragraph they had already said:\u2014\nLes charges du mariage \u00e9tant une dette de la communaut\u00e9, les cr\u00e9anciers ont certainement une action contre celle-ci et, par cons\u00e9quent, contre le mari (292). Peuvent-ils \u00e9galement poursuivre la femme? Il faut distinguer.\nS'il s'agit d'une obligation alimentaire mise par la loi \u00e0 la charge de la femme, on a affaire \u00e0 une dette qui est \u00e0 la fois commune et personnelle \u00e0 la femme: celle-ci peut donc \u00eatre poursuivie. Il en est ainsi des aliments dus aux enfants communs (art. 203),......\nThe respondent further quotes from Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, No. 2545, as follows:\u2014\nLes aliments fournis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 et dont la femme a profit\u00e9 donnent-ils une action contre elle en cas l'insolvabilit\u00e9 du mari? Non, selon la doctrine des anciens auteurs.\nThis paragraph is, however, under the heading, \"Des effets de la renonciation \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9\". Article 1494 C.N., 1382 C.C., deals with that situation and provides that the wife who renounces is released from all contribution to the debts of the community, except that\nshe remains liable towards the creditors when\u2026 the debt which has become a community debt was one for which she was originally liable.\nAs I have already pointed out, the obligation for maintenance of the family is thrown by Articles 165 and 173 entirely on the wife where the husband is insolvent, and is therefore a debt \"for which she was originally liable\" or \"attributable to herself\", to use the language of the Criminal Code. Dalloz, in R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Vol. 8, para. 737, which I have cited earlier in this judgment, deals expressly with the situation which exists in the case at bar.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, and direct the entry of judgment in favour of the appellant for the sum of $3,026.97 and interest from June 23, 1940. Cartwright, J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brothers Taschereau and Fauteux, I agree with the conclusion at which they have arrived and I wish to add only a few words.\nAfter a perusal of the complete record I find myself quite unable to say that the findings of fact made by the learned Chief Justice at the trial, concurred in as they have been by the Court of Appeal, should be set aside. Particularly I can not find in the evidence support for the view that at any stage of the dealings between the officials of the appellant and Mr. and Mrs. Kelly it was agreed that the respondent should become the principal debtor of the appellant in place of her husband. On the contrary, as my brother Fauteux points out, the appellant always retained Kelly as its debtor. It received payments from him personally from time to time as indeed it pleads in paragraph 5 of its \"Answer to Amended Plea of Female Defendant\" and it has taken judgment against him.\nI am equally unable to say that the evidence would justify a finding that Kelly was entirely without means during the period that he and his family stayed at the Place Viger Hotel. The uncontradicted evidence, which appears to have been accepted in both courts below, is that during this period he received payment of moneys due him of $7,000 and borrowed a further $5,000.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nFauteux, J.:\u2014En avril 1932, et \u00e0 la suite d'une entente intervenue entre le mari de l'intim\u00e9e et l'un des officiers de l'appelante, propri\u00e9taire de l'h\u00f4tel Viger, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, les \u00e9poux Kelly \u00e9tablissaient, \u00e0 toutes fins, \u00e0 cet endroit, leur foyer familial. Suivant l'usage, la demande de paiement des frais encourus pour chambres, pension, et autres services, \u00e9tait faite chaque semaine, par la remise du compte hebdomadaire aux Kelly. Mais le d\u00e9faut d'y satisfaire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement for\u00e7a \u00e9ventuellement les \u00e9poux \u00e0 s'y engager par billets. Et c'est ainsi qu'au cours et par suite de cette r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel de l'appelante pendant une p\u00e9riode de vingt-cinq mois, fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e la dette au paiement de laquelle les \u00e9poux Kelly se sont engag\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement par le billet produit au soutien de l'action. Ce billet fut donn\u00e9 en renouvellement de billets ant\u00e9rieurs sign\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e, endoss\u00e9s par son mari et remis \u00e0 l'appelante tant au cours qu'apr\u00e8s la fin du s\u00e9jour des Kelly \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel.\nL'action contre le mari a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; lequel est, depuis lors, pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e.\nL'intim\u00e9e, pour sa part, invoquant qu'elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de biens\u2014ainsi qu'elle est d'ailleurs d\u00e9crite au bref d'assignation\u2014, plaida avec succ\u00e8s devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, aussi bien que devant la Cour d'Appel51\u2014seul, M. le Juge St-Germain \u00e9tant dissident\u2014la nullit\u00e9 des engagements pris par elle et ce, en vertu des dispositions de l'article 1301 du Code Civil. L'appel devant cette Cour est de ce dernier jugement.\nL'article 1301 prescrit:\nLa femme ne peut s'obliger avec ou pour son mari, qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute obligation qu'elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, (sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi).\nIl ne peut faire aucun doute que la dette contract\u00e9e envers l'appelante repr\u00e9sente une charge du mariage. Comme telle, elle fait partie du passif de la communaut\u00e9 (1280, para. 5) et devient, en principe, mais sujet \u00e0 ce qui suit quant \u00e0 l'obligation de la payer, pour moiti\u00e9 \u00e0 la charge de chacun des \u00e9poux (1369).\nDe par la loi, et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'appelante, l'\u00e9poux de l'intim\u00e9e y est tenu pour la totalit\u00e9, sauf son recours contre sa femme au cas d'acceptation de la communaut\u00e9 (1371). Kelly a, d'ailleurs, ainsi que d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la payer int\u00e9gralement.\nDe par la loi \u00e9galement, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'appelante aussi bien qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son mari, l'intim\u00e9e n'est tenue de la payer que si elle accepte la communaut\u00e9 (1370).\nDe plus, et m\u00eame au cas d'acceptation, la responsabilit\u00e9 de la femme, \u00e9dict\u00e9e aux deux articles ci-dessus, n'est, sujet \u00e0 l'accomplissement des conditions prescrites, engag\u00e9e que dans la mesure y indiqu\u00e9e.\nAucun des faits, mentionn\u00e9s en l'article 1310, susceptibles de provoquer la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9 n'\u00e9tant survenu, l'occasion, pour l'intim\u00e9e, d'accepter cette communaut\u00e9 ou d'y renoncer, ne s'est jusqu'\u00e0 date encore jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Cons\u00e9quemment, l'obligation de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'appelante, aussi bien qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son mari, n'est pas encore n\u00e9e. Son existence future reste al\u00e9atoire.\nQu'elle ait personnellement, mais pour partie seulement, profit\u00e9 des services qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette dette, la chose est certaine. C'est l\u00e0, cependant, un avantage que la loi, \u00e0 raison du r\u00e9gime matrimonial sous lequel elle s'est mari\u00e9e, lui assurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout en d\u00e9niant contre ses propres, le recours des tiers aussi bien que celui de son mari, recours devenu par la loi, dans son principe et sa mesure, assujetti aux conditions ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9es. Les biens du d\u00e9biteur sont le gage du cr\u00e9ancier. C'est l\u00e0 un principe d'\u00e9l\u00e9mentaire justice sanctionn\u00e9 par le texte m\u00eame de la loi (1981). Mais le d\u00e9biteur, en l'esp\u00e8ce, n'est pas encore la femme; c'est la communaut\u00e9, c'est le mari. Et, \u00e0 l'actif de cette communaut\u00e9, la femme, on peut le rappeler, apporte d\u00e9j\u00e0 sa contribution. La loi d\u00e9signe ceux de ses biens qui entrent dans cette communaut\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre du passif (1272), comme elle indique ceux qui en sont exclus\u2014ses propres\u2014(1275 et s.)\u2014pour prot\u00e9ger la femme contre les abus possibles de la ma\u00eetrise absolue et exclusive accord\u00e9e au mari sur les biens de cette communaut\u00e9 (1292).\nDe ce chef, l'action de l'appelante contre l'intim\u00e9e ne saurait \u00eatre maintenue puisque, de par la loi m\u00eame, elle n'est pas encore tenue de payer et qu'il rest\u00e9, en fait, probl\u00e9matique de savoir si elle le sera jamais. (Hudon et al v. Marceau 52; Bruneau et vir et Barnes et vir 53; Globensky v. Boucher 54 ; Proulx et vir v. Caisse Populaire de Rimouski 55.\nMais les arguments suivants avanc\u00e9s par l'appelante doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nOn pr\u00e9tend d'abord que l'intim\u00e9e s'est engag\u00e9e personnellement vis-\u00e0-vis l'appelante\u2014i.e., qu'elle a engag\u00e9 ses propres\u2014\u00e0 supporter cette charge du mariage, et, que ce soit la dette \u00e0 venir ou pass\u00e9e en r\u00e9sultant, elle serait li\u00e9e ainsi ex contractu.\nIl est av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'origine, c'est le mari, le chef de la communaut\u00e9, qui fit l'entente avec l'appelante. Nulle part appara\u00eet-il en preuve que, subs\u00e9quemment, un contrat soit intervenu de fa\u00e7on expresse entre l'intim\u00e9e et l'appelante. Et le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, aussi bien que les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, n'ont pu d\u00e9duire de tous les faits prouv\u00e9s en cette cause, aucun tel contrat, m\u00eame implicite. Sur ce point, il y a donc concurrence de vues des deux Cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nIl est manifeste, cependant, que les repr\u00e9sentations faites \u00e0 l'appelante par le mari\u2014subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l'arrangement intervenu entre eux et post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'apparition des appr\u00e9hensions de l'appelante sur le paiement de ses services\u2014sur les expectatives financi\u00e8res de l'intim\u00e9e, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 assurer aux Kelly le prolongement de leur s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel et la continuation des avantages qu'ils en ont retir\u00e9s. Quoi qu'il en soit de cette circonstance ou des autres, en l'esp\u00e8ce, pouvant avoir une port\u00e9e sur cette question, et assumant qu'on en puisse d\u00e9duire que l'intim\u00e9e aurait, subs\u00e9quemment et pour les raisons ci-dessus, implicitement consenti \u00e0 s'engager\u2014i.e., \u00e0 engager ses propres\u2014\u00e0 l'endroit de l'appelante, pour le paiement de cette charge du mariage\u2014que ce soit la dette future ou pass\u00e9e en d\u00e9coulant, peu importe\u2014, la v\u00e9ritable question est de savoir si, en prenant tel engagement dans les circonstances de cette cause, soit pour avoir du cr\u00e9dit pour l'avenir ou payer la dette existante, l'intim\u00e9e s'est oblig\u00e9e avec ou pour son mari autrement qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune et ce, en violation de la prohibition contenue en l'article 1301.\nIl faut bien observer d'abord que m\u00eame si, en fait, tel engagement fut pris par l'intim\u00e9e, son \u00e9poux n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, pour cela, lib\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de l'appelante, de l'obligation qu'il avait, d\u00e8s l'origine, en fonction de la m\u00eame charge ou de la m\u00eame dette, de par la loi, aussi bien que par contrat. Nulle part en la preuve pouvons-nous retrouver l'intention de l'appelante de l'en d\u00e9charger. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et bien au contraire, cette derni\u00e8re n'a jamais renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ses droits et recours contre lui, mais a constamment recherch\u00e9 et obtenu sa signature, aussi bien que celle de sa femme, sur les billets qu'elle exigeait. Et elle a obtenu jugement contre lui. De sorte qu'\u00e0 l'endroit de l'appelante,\u2014aussi bien, d'ailleurs qu'ex lege \u00e0 l'endroit de l'intim\u00e9e\u2014, Kelly, d\u00e9biteur de l'obligation \u00e0 l'origine, l'est toujours demeur\u00e9 et ce, ex contractu aussi bien qu'ex lege.\nEt voil\u00e0 bien un facteur juridique d'importance \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de l'applicabilit\u00e9 ou non de l'article 1301. En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, cette Cour, dans Rodrigue et Dostie 56, r\u00e9affirmait, \u00e0 la page 570, le principe suivant:\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Trust & Loan v. Gauthier, ont \u00e9tabli que la r\u00e8gle d'ordre public contenue dans l'article 1301 C.C. ne saurait \u00eatre frustr\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re indirecte et que, quels que soient les moyens d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s employ\u00e9s pour l'\u00e9luder, d\u00e8s que les faits viendront \u00e0 la connaissance du tribunal, il annulera toute obligation contract\u00e9e directement ou indirectement par la femme en violation de cet article. C'est un principe que cette cour a elle-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin. En pareille mati\u00e8re, l'enqu\u00eate du juge ne saurait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e par les \u00e9nonciations du contrat, ni se laisser arr\u00eater par les expressions contenues dans les actes. Au del\u00e0 des termes, il recherchera si la convention ne constitue pas une violation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e.\nEt, \u00e0 la page 571 du m\u00eame rapport:\nQuelles que soient les voies indirectes qui sont employ\u00e9es pour obtenir l'obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e, la nullit\u00e9 d'ordre public \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 1301 C.C. doit recevoir tout son effet du moment qu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante que les parties contractantes ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 enfreindre la loi.\nCons\u00e9quemment, il importe peu que l'intim\u00e9e, co-signataire avec son mari du billet produit au soutien de l'action, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment seule signataire de ce billet alors que son mari en \u00e9tait l'endosseur. La m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e ou les formes suivies pour engager, pour l'avenir, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 satisfaire avec ses propres une dette qui n'\u00e9tait pas la sienne, quel qu'ait \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, l'accord de volont\u00e9 de toutes les parties concern\u00e9es, ne peuvent entrer en consid\u00e9ration si on a, de cette fa\u00e7on, fait indirectement ce que la loi d\u00e9fend de faire directement. On ne peut davantage pr\u00e9tendre corriger la position en sugg\u00e9rant que ces billets sign\u00e9s par elle et endoss\u00e9s par son mari, ou le billet o\u00f9 les deux sont cosignataires, aient op\u00e9r\u00e9 novation et modifi\u00e9 les rapports juridiques des parties. La novation suppose la validit\u00e9 de la dette nov\u00e9e et ne peut, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, servir \u00e0 couvrir une nullit\u00e9 d'ordre public si telle nullit\u00e9 frappait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'obligation initiale.\nOr, dans Trust and Loan Company of Canada v. Gauthier 57, le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil priv\u00e9 d\u00e9clarait, \u00e0 la page 100 :\nThe language of art. 1301 renders it necessary to distinguish between obligations of a wife for her husband and other obligations contracted by her. The object of the article is evidently to protect her against her husband and against herself. Except in dealing with their common property, she is not to bind herself with him, i.e., she is not to join him in any obligation which affects him. But she clearly does not infringe art. 1301 by simply disposing of her own property with his concurrence under art. 177. If this is done for her own benefit, the disposition is good. If, however, she disposes of it for her husband, she immediately falls within art. 1301. What then is meant by \"for him\"? Does it mean jointly with him, or as his surety and nothing more? or does it mean for him generally, i.e., in any way for his benefit?...............\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces questions appara\u00eet \u00e0 la page 101 :\nBut their Lordships gather from the decisions referred to in the argument and in the published commentaries on the Code Civil that the words \"for her husband\" are now judicially held to mean generally in any way for his purposes as distinguished from those of his wife;\nIl ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter la question de savoir si l'avantage (benefit) que l'intim\u00e9e a, de fait et pour sa part, retir\u00e9 de cet engagement all\u00e9gu\u00e9, est v\u00e9ritablement un avantage de la nature de celui dont parle Lord Lindley dans la citation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Et il faudrait bien noter, dans la d\u00e9termination de cette question subsidiaire si elle se pr\u00e9sentait, n\u00e9cessairement, que l'avantage retir\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e lui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 assur\u00e9 par la loi sur les biens de la communaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de son mari.\nDe toutes fa\u00e7ons, le moins qu'on puisse dire\u2014et ceci suffit pour disposer de la question principale\u2014, c'est que l'obligation qu'aurait alors contract\u00e9e l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit de l'appelante, n'\u00e9tait pas uniquement pour sa propre affaire, mais qu'elle aurait ainsi \u00e9galement engag\u00e9 ses propres pour l'avenir, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de son mari, aussi bien que pour le sien. Dans Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audette 58, cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 310:\n\u2026que l'obligation contract\u00e9e par la femme avec son mari est sans effet lorsqu'elle n'est pas uniquement pour sa propre affaire, mais l'est \u00e9galement pour le compte de son mari.\nLe m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans la cause de Sterling Woollens and Silk Co. Ltd. v. Lashinsky 59, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9 en plus que, m\u00eame la fraude d'un des \u00e9poux ne peut entrer en consid\u00e9ration pour emp\u00eacher la nullit\u00e9 des conventions faites en violation des dispositions de l'article 1301. Ce qui prime, c'est la fraude \u00e0 la loi.\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il me faut ajouter que je ne puis voir ici d'application \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de La Banque d'Hochelaga v. Jodoin et autres 60. Il est certain que si la loi d\u00e9fend ainsi \u00e0 la femme de s'obliger avec ou pour son mari, autrement qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune, elle permet cependant au mari de s'obliger pour les affaires propres de sa femme. La validit\u00e9 de tel engagement s'inf\u00e8re des dispositions de l'article 1302. Et dans cette cause, on a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment jug\u00e9, en fait, que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la femme qui s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e pour son mari mais bien ce dernier qui s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 pour elle. En somme, et dans les termes m\u00eames du jugement, \"The whole affair was the wife's affair\".\nDans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause, je dois donc conclure que si, comme on le pr\u00e9tend, l'intim\u00e9e s'est engag\u00e9e personnellement \u00e0 supporter cette charge du mariage ou \u00e0 en payer la dette en r\u00e9sultant, c'est l\u00e0 un engagement par lequel elle s'obligeait avec et pour son mari, autrement qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune, et c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cas vis\u00e9 par l'article 1301.\nCette conclusion para\u00eet conforme \u00e0 la doctrine. Lange-lier, Cours de droit civil, vol. 4, page 395, commentant sur les articles 1373, 1374 et 1375 du Code Civil:\nQue faut-il entendre par dettes de la communaut\u00e9 qui proviennent du chef de la femme? Il y en a deux esp\u00e8ces: les dettes qu'elle devait lors de son mariage et qui sont tomb\u00e9es dans la communaut\u00e9, et celles qu'elle a contract\u00e9es pendant son mariage avec l'autorisation de son mari.\nQuant aux dettes qu'elle devait lors de son mariage, il va de soi, comme je viens de vous le dire, qu'elle en reste tenue envers ses cr\u00e9anciers. Ils peuvent donc s'adresser \u00e0 elle pour se les faire payer. Mais, si elle les paie, elle a droit de s'en faire rembourser pour moiti\u00e9 par la communaut\u00e9 si elle l'accepte, et pour le tout si elle y renonce.\nQuant aux dettes qu'elle a contract\u00e9es pendant la communaut\u00e9, vous avez vu dans l'article 1280, le paragrape 2, que la communaut\u00e9 en est tenue si elle les a contract\u00e9es avec le consentement de son mari. Mais les cr\u00e9anciers envers lesquels elle les a contract\u00e9es peuvent-ils se les faire payer par elle? Il faut distinguer: ou elle les a contract\u00e9es pour elle-m\u00eame, ou elle les a contract\u00e9es pour son mari. Si elle les a contract\u00e9es pour elle-m\u00eame, ses cr\u00e9anciers peuvent se les faire payer par elle. Si, au contraire, elle les a contract\u00e9es pour son mari ou pour la communaut\u00e9, ce qui revient au m\u00eame, ils n'ont pas droit de se les faire payer par elle, car, comme vous l'avez vu lorsque nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l'article 1801, une femme mari\u00e9e ne peut s'obliger avec ou pour son mari que comme commune, et toute obligation qu'elle contracte en contravention \u00e0 cette disposition est nulle.\nMignault, Droit civil canadien, Vol. 6, page 329, traitant du passif de la communaut\u00e9 et de la contribution aux dettes:\nSi les deux \u00e9poux se sont oblig\u00e9s solidairement, le mari pourra \u00eatre poursuivi pour le tout, mais la femme, par application de l'article 1374, qui est une cons\u00e9quence de l'article 1301, ne pourra \u00eatre poursuivie que pour moiti\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 de commune. L'auteur ajoute la note suivante apr\u00e8s citation de l'article 1374:\na) Cet article est, comme l'article 1301, contraire \u00e0 l'ancien droit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 par notre l\u00e9gislation provinciale (statuts refondus du Bas-Canada, ch. 37, s. 55) ; il est aussi oppos\u00e9 au code Napol\u00e9on (art. 1487) qui a reproduit l'ancien droit et qui permet de poursuivre la femme pour le tout, si l'obligation est solidaire, et pour moiti\u00e9, si elle n'est que conjointe.\nEt l'auteur continue:\nSi la femme s'est oblig\u00e9e conjointement avec son mari, elle sera tenue pour moiti\u00e9 seulement (art. 1374) : ce n'est en effet, que comme commune et dans cette limite qu'elle a jou\u00e9 le r\u00f4le de d\u00e9bitrice. Quant au mari, il sera tenu pour le tout: car, en faisant intervenir sa femme au contrat, il a entendu, non pas s'obliger pour moiti\u00e9 seulement, en rejetant l'autre moiti\u00e9 sur sa femme, mais donner au cr\u00e9ancier une garantie de plus.\nA cela, la note suivante est jointe:\nb) Je suppose que la dette n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la femme, et alors on peut dire que les deux \u00e9poux se sont oblig\u00e9s comme communs en biens. Partant, c'est une dette de la communaut\u00e9, et le mari la devrait en entier par application de l'article 1371.\nDes conclusions diff\u00e9rentes sont adopt\u00e9es en France, o\u00f9 les commentateurs signalent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que le s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien, inspiration de notre article 1301, est depuis longtemps disparu du droit fran\u00e7ais, droit dans lequel on ne retrouve pas, d'ailleurs, de dispositions correspondantes \u00e0 notre article 1374, corollaire de l'article 1301.\nColin et Capitant, Droit civil fran\u00e7ais, Tome 3, 1950, p. 180, n\u00b0 284:\nLorsque le mari et la femme s'obligent solidairement, ils sont, sans contestation possible, tenus l'un et l'autre pour la totalit\u00e9 de la dette, non seulement pendant la communaut\u00e9, mais apr\u00e8s sa dissolution, aussi bien sur leur part de communaut\u00e9 que sur leurs biens propres. Aussi, en fait, les cr\u00e9anciers qui traitent avec un homme mari\u00e9 ne manquent-ils jamais d'exiger, nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, cet engagement solidaire. Nul texte n'interdit du reste \u00e0 la femme de prendre un engagement de ce genre, car le s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien a depuis longtemps disparu de notre Droit.\nQuant \u00e0 l'exception de bonne foi pr\u00e9vue en l'article 1301, il est manifeste que l'appelante ne peut l'invoquer. Ses appr\u00e9hensions sur le paiement \u00e9tablissent suffisamment la connaissance qu'elle avait de la situation financi\u00e8re du mari et le but v\u00e9ritable de ces engagements subsidiairement obtenus par elle de la femme, \u00e0 la suggestion du mari. De plus, elle devait, ou au moins elle pouvait conna\u00eetre le r\u00e9gime matrimonial des \u00e9poux et les cons\u00e9quences l\u00e9gales en r\u00e9sultant. Mais, invoquant les dispositions des articles 165, 173 et 1317 du Code Civil, l'appelante soumet un autre argument. En somme, dit-on, vu l'absence de moyens de la communaut\u00e9 et du mari, l'existence des moyens de la femme, pour supporter cette charge du mariage, l'intim\u00e9e est devenue, \u00e0 raison de ces faits et par la force des dispositions ci-dessus, actuellement et l\u00e9galement oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 ce faire. En s'engageant, comme on le pr\u00e9tend, \u00e0 l'endroit de l'appelante, elle ne faisait, dit-on, que reconna\u00eetre et d\u00e9charger l'obligation alimentaire,\u2014civile ou naturelle, peu importe, ce qui lui \u00e9tait devenue propre de par la loi.\nNotre Code reconna\u00eet particuli\u00e8rement deux sources d'obligations relativement aux aliments: D'une part, l'obligation purement l\u00e9gale, existant ind\u00e9pendamment de toutes conventions matrimoniales, et, d'autre part, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l'obligation conventionnelle arr\u00eat\u00e9e par les futurs \u00e9poux aux fins de leur union. La premi\u00e8re est d'ordre public et on n'en peut \u00e9carter le principe dans les conventions matrimoniales; et, en ce sens, elle prime sur celles-ci. Mais puisque, sous cette r\u00e9serve, l'obligation conventionnelle est non seulement autoris\u00e9e mais que la loi elle-m\u00eame, suppl\u00e9ant \u00e0 l'absence de contrat de mariage, veut que les \u00e9poux soient tenus comme ayant convenu d'accepter le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, il faut donner effet \u00e0 cette obligation conventionnelle. Autrement, les dispositions de la loi qui y sont relatives, deviennent inutiles. Dans ce sens pratique, l'obligation conventionnelle prime donc sur l'obligation l\u00e9gale qui ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 titre exceptionnel et subsidiaire. Il appartient donc \u00e0 celui qui veut s'en pr\u00e9valoir de justifier de son droit \u00e0 ce faire en d\u00e9montrant, par la preuve de circonstances particuli\u00e8res, l'inefficacit\u00e9 de l'obligation conventionnelle pour assurer le minimum garanti par l'obligation l\u00e9gale.\nTraitant de la contribution aux charges du mariage dans le cas de s\u00e9paration de biens, Mignault, Droit civil canadien, Vol. 6, page 397, ayant cit\u00e9 l'article 1423, dit:\nDonc la premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 consulter c'est le contrat de mariage. S'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que le mari seul subviendra aux d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage, et qu'il soit en \u00e9tat de le faire, la, femme ne peut \u00eatre forc\u00e9e d'y contribuer, ni par son mari, ni par ses cr\u00e9anciers. Si elle s'est personnellement oblig\u00e9e, son obligation para\u00eet \u00eatre une violation de la prohibition de l'article 1301, car la femme s'est oblig\u00e9e pour son mari, seul d\u00e9biteur dans ces circonstances. C'est l\u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re exceptionnel et subsidiaire de l'obligation l\u00e9gale dans le cas o\u00f9 on a convenu de la s\u00e9paration de biens. A fortiori, la m\u00eame conclusion s'impose sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale.\nEn la pr\u00e9sente cause, je ne puis trouver au dossier la preuve de ces circonstances n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en jeu de l'Obligation l\u00e9gale par d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 l'obligation conventionnelle. Et il devient alors \u00e9vident que si, ni Kelly, ni sa fille ne pouvaient, sur la base des faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve, invoquer avec succ\u00e8s, contre l'intim\u00e9e, cette obligation l\u00e9gale, l'appelante, invoquant les droits de Kelly et sa fille,\u2014assumant qu'elle en ait le droit,\u2014ne peut davantage r\u00e9ussir.\nSous le r\u00e9gime de l'obligation l\u00e9gale, le droit aux aliments se conditionne et se mesure par la relation existant entre les besoins de celui qui les r\u00e9clame et les moyens de celui \u00e0 qui on les demande.\nSans doute, Kelly avait contre lui des jugements pour la satisfaction desquels il paraissait afficher peu de souci. Il \u00e9tait, cependant, en bonne sant\u00e9 et pouvait travailler. Et, dans les termes de Planiol et Ripert, tome 2, \u00e9d. 1926, Trait\u00e9 de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, page 25:\nUn individu qui peut se procurer de quoi vivre en travaillant n'a pas droit \u00e0 des aliments, quoiqu'il n'ait pas de biens; il n'est pas m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire que cette profession lucrative soit exerc\u00e9e en fait, il suffit que son exercice soit possible.\nEn fait, la preuve \u00e9tablit que Kelly avait, par son travail, touch\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment une somme de dix mille dollars. Cette preuve n'est pas contredite et le dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune tentative, qu'il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 l'appelante de faire, pour la v\u00e9rifier et l'\u00e9carter. Il aurait, \u00e9galement, obtenu par un emprunt un montant de cinq mille dollars. Ceci, non plus, n'est pas contredit.\nQuant aux moyens de l'intim\u00e9e, il appert que les seuls argents dont elle disposait dans les premiers mois de leur s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel Viger, \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par une somme de $166 par mois.

Il est vrai qu'\u00e9ventuellement, le revenu mensuel de l'intim\u00e9e s'\u00e9leva \u00e0 cette somme, laquelle, suffisante pour couvrir le compte mensuel d'h\u00f4tel pour les \u00e9poux et leur enfant, demeurait insuffisante au paiement de toutes les autres charges du mariage, et des dettes accumul\u00e9es.\nIl para\u00eet \u00e9vident, en somme, que les Kelly n'avaient pas, alors, les moyens de vivre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel de l'appelante.

Si, en l'esp\u00e8ce, ce principe devait pr\u00e9valoir contre les dispositions d'ordre public de l'article 1301, ces derni\u00e8res deviendraient absolument sans effet. Il suffit bien de consid\u00e9rer tous les cas o\u00f9 les tribunaux ont appliqu\u00e9 cet article pour se convaincre que, dans la majorit\u00e9, les d\u00e9biteurs poursuivis\u2014sans succ\u00e8s, \u00e0 raison du principe de l'article 1301\u2014s'\u00e9taient enrichis aux d\u00e9pens du cr\u00e9ancier poursuivant.\nPour ces raisons, je renverrais le pr\u00e9sent appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Grossman And Gussun (Suppliants) Appellants;\nand\nHis Majesty The King, (Respondent) Respondent.\n1951: October 10, 11, 12, 15; 1952: February 5.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nAirports\u2014Operated by Crown\u2014Duty to make safe for aircraft\u2014Warnings of Danger\u2014Crown\u2014Whether breach of duty by servant acting within scope of his employment, renders Crown liable under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, as amended.\nOn July 19, 1948, the appellant Grossman, piloting a light aircraft approached the Saskatoon airport, operated by the Department of Transport. Preparatory to landing he had observed workmen on the concrete runways, and diverted his course to a grass runway. While taxiing to a stop he suddenly noticed some distance in front an open ditch which cut across the runway. In attempting to take-off again he was unsuccessful in avoiding the ditch with the result that his aircraft was damaged beyond repair and his passenger and fellow appellant, Sun, was injured. The ditch in question, was not, in the view of the Court, sufficiently marked by a number of posts on which red flags had been placed by one Nicholas, the airport maintenance foreman, and they had not been seen by Grossman. The appellants' action to recover damages under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act as amended, was dismissed in the Exchequer Court where the damages of Grossman were assessed at $7,003.90 and those of Sun at $440.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J., dissenting) that:\n1. The open ditch across the grass runway constituted an obstruction and was recognized as such by Nicholas. In failing to provide adequate warning of the danger he failed in his duty to persons such as the appellants, and this breach of duty was negligence for which the Crown under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act was responsible. The King v. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. [1927] S.C.R. 69 and The King v. Hochelaga Shipping & Towing Co. Ltd. [1940] S.C.R. 153, followed.\n2. No negligence could be attributed to Grossman.\n3. As the total amount claimed by Sun was $440, the Court under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act, had no jurisdiction to hear his appeal which should therefore be quashed.\nPer (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J., dissenting). The claim was not for an act of misfeasance but of alleged non-feasance. If there was failure on the part of Nicholas to cause adequate measures to be taken to warn aviators and such failure caused or contributed to the accident, Nicholas was not personally liable and accordingly the action against the Crown should fail.

The matter was not affected by the Air Regulations enacted under the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 3, which were not expressed as applying to the Crown.\nAPPEAL from the Exchequer Court of Canada 1 dismissing a petition of right against the Crown with costs.\nJ. M. Cuelenaere K.C. for the appellants. The suppliants bring their action pursuant to the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34 and in particular under s. 19(c) of that Act as amended by 1938 (Can.) c. 28, and seek to recover damages suffered by them as a result of an accident as outlined in the Statement of Facts. It is admitted in the pleadings and it was found by the learned trial judge that the Saskatoon Airport was constructed by the Crown as a Public Work and is being maintained and operated as a licensed airport for the use of the public. Such maintenance and operation is under the general supervision and direction of Earl Hickson, District Inspector of Airways, and managed by Philip R. Nichols. Both are servants of the Crown. The fact that the accident took place and the nature of the injuries suffered, it is submitted, were well established.\nBroadly the question to be determined is whether the loss or damage suffered by the suppliants was due to the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duty or employment, so as to make the Crown liable in damages under s. 19(c).\nIt is submitted the trial judge was right in finding as he did that the officers of the Crown in charge of the airport were negligent and that the negligence consisted in the officers' failure to give or provide adequate warning. It is submitted they were negligent in the following respects: (1) Allowing the ditch in question to remain open after it became known that it constituted an obstruction or hazard to flying.\n2. Allowing the ditch to remain without being clearly marked. The general and accepted practice at airports and the Air Regulations require that any obstruction existing at a landing area be marked. (s. 12, Air Regulations.)\n3. Allowing grass and weeds to grow and debris to accumulate in the ditch, making it difficult, if not impossible, to sight the ditch from the air.\n4. Having allowed land markers visible from the air to remain on the grass runways, and the word \"Airport\" to remain on a building adjacent to such runways; failure to mark the end of such runways or to give adequate warning of the obstruction or hazard to any person using such runways. Each of the above enumerated particulars or two or more taken together constituted negligence on the part of the officers or servants of the Crown.\nThe liability of the Crown under s. 19(c) has been discussed in numerous cases. In Rex v. Anthony 2 Rand J. sets out the nature of the negligence giving rise to liability on the part of the Crown. In the present case the acts of the officers or servants of the Crown constitute positive conduct within the scope of their duties or employment. The Crown and its officers or servants owed a duty to the suppliant as user of the airport and failed to discharge that duty in such a manner as to raise a liability on the servant for which the master (the Crown) becomes liable. Sincenne McNaughton Line v. The King 3 ; Yukon Southern Air Transport v. The King 4 ; Howard v. The King 5 ; The King v. Hochelaga Shipping 6. In none of the above cases was the question of invitation discussed. The liability of the Crown was based on the use of a public work by a person lawfully on the premises. The cases cited set out the principle relating to the liability of the Crown under s. 19(c). In the present case the airport was a public work built by and at the expense of the Dominion Government and maintained and operated by the officers and servants of the Crown for the benefit of the Crown and for the use of the public. In the light of these authorities it is submitted that the suppliants suffered injury and that the officers or servants of the Crown were negligent, and the trial judge should have held that the suppliants were entitled to recover. Alternatively, he erred in holding the suppliants were licensees and in not holding that they were invitees.\nThe Saskatoon Airport is an airport designated as such by the Minister of Transport. The Air Regulations, Part III s. 1, require that no area shall be used as an airport unless it has been licensed as required by the regulations. The airport is so licensed. It was constructed and is maintained and operated for the purpose of providing facilities for aerial transportation. The Air Regulations, Part III, s. 6, grants to the operator of any licensed airport permission to charge for its use or for any services performed, such fees as have been approved by the Ministry. The Saskatoon Airport provides hangar facilities, repair servicing, fuel and oil.\nWhere an airport is operated by a public authority, such public authority, either expressly or by implication, invite the public requiring such facilities to use that airport, and the position of such public authority, its officers or servants, is no different to the owner of a private commercial landing field. As to the latter see Beck v. Wing Field 7.\nThe liability of public authorities with respect to buildings is set out in: Arder v. Winnipeg 8; Nickell v. Windsor 9; Edmondson v. Moose Jaw School District 10; Blair v. Toronto 11.\nThe trial judge ought to have found the suppliants were invitees. If invitees, the common law imposes a duty to take reasonable care against endangering life or property. Charlesworth, The Law of Negligence at 154, quoting Parnaby v. Lancaster Canal Co. In Imperial Airway Ltd. v. Flying Service Ltd. 12 it was held that under English law the owner of a public airport is bound: (a) To see that the airport is safe for the use of aircraft entitled to use it, and (b) To give proper warning of any danger of which he knows or should know. Peavey v. City of Miami 13 quoted by the trial judge is distinguishable. There the pilot knew that the airport was then under construction, and he had a blind spot in his aircraft. In the present case the danger was not reasonably foreseeable. Where the user of the premises is an invitee it is no defence to show that the danger was open and obvious, if in fact reasonable steps have not been taken to protect the person coming on the premises. Knowledge of the condition may establish contributory negligence on the part of the user, but here, there was no knowledge. Charlesworth supra at 157, 136 and 123. In the light of the authorities referred to and the facts of this case, the trial judge ought to have found that the Suppliants were invitees and that there was a breach of duty committed by the officers or servants of the Crown giving rise to liability on the part of the Crown. In the. further alternative, even if the suppliants were licensees, the trial judge erred in holding that the ditch in question was an obvious danger and in not holding that the ditch was in the nature of a trap, and in holding that Grossman failed to take reasonable care or was guilty of negligence. The evidence discloses that Grossman acted reasonably and diligently exercising the same care as other pilots would have exercised under similar circumstances. In the alternative, if the finding of negligence on the part of the suppliant Grossman is accepted, the trial judge should have held that the damage or loss was caused by the fault of both the officers or servants of the Crown and the suppliant, and should have determined the degree in which each was at fault and directed that the suppliants were entitled to recover in proportion to the degree in which the servants of the Crown were at fault. The Contributory Negligence Act 1944 (Sask.) c. 23, ss. 2 and 3. The liability of the Crown under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act is not confined to cases where the negligent act of the Crown's officer or servant is the sole cause of the injury. The Contributory Negligence Act (Sask.) applies against the Crown. The King v. Laperriere 14 ; The King v. Murphy 15 ; Arial v. The King 16 ; Blair v. Toronto, supra.\nG. H. Yule K.C. and David Mundell for the respondent. No case against the Crown was made out in the petition or on the evidence. The Crown is not liable in tort except in so far as liability is imposed by statute. Tobin v. The Queen 17; Feather v. The Queen 18. The appellants must rely on s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended by 1938 (Can.) c. 28. The King v. Anthony 19; The King v. Murphy 20. In para. 8 of the petition the appellants assert \"that the said officers and servants of the Crown (the said officers' refer back to the officers and servants in para. 7 who allegedly constructed the ditch) owed a duty to the suppliants to construct and maintain an airport fit for landing and the suppliants say that it was the duty of the said officers and servants to see to it that the said ditch was properly filled in, protected and adequately marked, but failed in the performance of that duty while acting within the scope of their employment by allowing the said ditch or excavation to remain open as aforesaid and\/or without adequate markings. The ditch was constructed under contract with the Department of Transport by the Tomlinson Construction Co., relevant parts of which are to be found in the case. The ditch was designed to be an open ditch and to be kept open for drainage purposes. The Crown does not owe any duty as occupier to licensees coming on property that it occupies and servants of the Crown in charge of Crown premises are not occupiers and therefore do not owe any such duty. Adams v. Naylor 21.\nThe trial judge erred in holding that the Crown owed any duty to the appellants and should have held that the appellants had not brought themselves within the requirements set forth in the Anthony and Murphy cases to prove personal negligence on the part of some officer or servant of the Crown ; that is a breach of duty owed by an officer or servant of the Crown to the appellants. This not having been done, it is submitted that the King v. Hochelaga Shipping & Towing Co. case referred to by the trial judge at p. 198 is not in point.\nIf the appellants were licensees on Crown property, and if either the Crown or any officer or servant of the Crown, as occupier, owed any duty to the appellants as licensees, the only duty owed by the Crown or any such officer or servant would be to warn the licensees of any concealed danger or a trap. The petition does not allege a breach of any such duty nor does the evidence disclose any which would bring on him personal responsibility to the appellants. The only person on the evidence who was personally in charge of the airport was Nicholas, who is described as \"Air Port Maintenance Foreman\". Could Grossman have successfully asserted personal negligence by Nicholas? It is submitted not. The trial judge erred in holding that the appellants were licensees on that part of the property of the Crown where the accident took place. A licensee is one who comes on the property by permission, express or implied, for his own purposes. It is doubtful if on the allegation in the petition the appellants are entitled to assert that they were licensees on the area where the accident took place but in any event it is submitted that they were not licensees. That area was formerly a landing field for the R.C.A.F. When the department took over and built the new runways, that area was not maintained by the Crown.\nIt is conceded that Grossman would have been a licensee of the Crown in landing on the hard-surfaced runways. The onus is on him to establish permission to land where he did. He must bring himself within the area of permission, the same as the invitee must bring himself within the area of invitation. There is no evidence that would establish permission to land where he did. The simple fact is that Grossman decided not to land on any of the four serviceable hard-surface runways but picked out the grassy area because he thought it looked like a good place to make a landing. His case appears to be that he has the right to dictate to the Crown where he shall land and that the Crown has no control over the situation at all. Exhibit 2, a diagram of the Saskatoon airport, shows a portion described as \"Dotted area is abandoned airdrome\". This is the area in which the accident took place. This exhibit, on which the Attorney General relies strongly, is an official publication obtainable from the Department of Natural Resources, Engineering Division, and can be had for the asking. Grossman had in his possession a map prepared in 1941, before the Saskatoon Airport was constructed and he never applied for any other information, maps or any other material before he decided to come to an airport of which he knew nothing. The per mission, held out by the Department of Transport is the permission indicated by Exhibit 2, and if he had asked for a copy of this, the area of permission would have been plain. How can he be heard to say when he did not take the elementary precaution to get such a document from the department that he has the right to dictate the area of permission? If he had he would have seen detail as to the radio range and how to contact it, and would have been told where to land and to keep away from the area where he was hurt.\nThe appellants contend that because the grassy area on which Grossman landed was so used by other aircraft, that that would imply permission by conduct for him to land on the same area. This is not so. In order to establish such permission (1) There would have to be much more evidence than there was here to establish the circumstances regarding the use of this area by other craft. (2) If this craft was using the area by tolerance, to establish permission on the part of the Crown it would have to be shown that responsible officers knew of such use. (3) In any event Grossman would have to show that he relied on previous use as implied permission.\nOn the first point, there was no evidence under what circumstances or arrangements, if any, between Saskatoon Flying Club and the department this area was used by the club. It is to be assumed there must have been some contractual relationship. It is a fair assumption that other light aircraft landing on the area might have been doing so under some arrangement with the Flying Club, or without permission. The building marked \"airport\" is a C.P.R. building. If C.P.R. light aircraft were using the area, surely it would be with some contractual arrangement with the department and not by leave and licence or tolerance amounting thereto. On the second point, in order to establish leave and licence of the Crown, it would have to be shown that responsible officers of the department knew of such use. Jenkins v. Great Western Ry. 22; Pianosi v. C.P.R. 23. On the third point, assuming responsible officers of the department knew that light aircraft had been landing on the area for some time, Grossman, to establish leave and licence to him, would have to show that he was aware of such licence. Clark & Linsell, Ed. 10, p. 653; Lowrey v. Walker 24.\nIn all these cases the injured party asserting leave and licence because of prior use by others, knew of the prior use and assumed that it would be in order for him to enter as the public had been doing. Here, Grossman had no such knowledge. Coleshill v. Manchester Corporation 25 ; Jenkins v. Great Western Ry. 26. It is submitted that the appellants would have to establish permission to land on the area. Assuming Grossman had been invited to land on the new runways and being an invitee was entitled to a higher degree of duty than a licensee, it is submitted that he would be outside the extent of the invitation if he landed where he did, or, in any event, would have to prove that the area was within the area of invitation. 23 Halsbury, 606, para. 855; London Graving Dock Co. v. Horton 27.\nIf Grossman used this area by leave and licence of the Crown, then the reasons of the trial judge are relied on, holding that there was no breach of duty on the part of the Crown to Grossman and his unfortunate accident was entirely due to his fundamental failure to use care for his own safety on strange territory. Hounsell v. Smyth 28 ; Mersey Dock & Harbour Board v. Procter 29; Bay Front Garage Ltd, v. Evers 30.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Locke J. (dissenting) was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.:\u2014The claim of the appellants against the Crown as pleaded is for damage sustained by an aeroplane, the property of the appellant Grossman, and personal injuries by the appellant Sun when an airplane, the property of and piloted by the former, landed at an airport near Saskatoon owned by the Crown and operated by the department. On the day in question the appellants had flown from Prince Albert to Saskatoon and they allege that when they arrived at the airport at the latter place they saw a building on which the word \"airport\" was legibly painted and observed landing strips and some other buildings, whereupon they proceeded to land, when the plane ran into a ditch which crossed part of the airport causing the damage and injuries complained of. Other than the fact that the word \"airport\" thus appeared, no invitation or permission to use the facilities of the airport is alleged.\nThe exact nature of the claims as pleaded is to be noted : after alleging that the ditch was not marked by clearly visible markings and was not \"detectable\" from the air, the appellants asserted that the ditch was made by officers and servants of the Crown \"while acting within the scope of their duties of employment and in the course of establishing and constructing the said airport the said officers and servants allowed the ditch or excavation to remain open in such a manner as to provide a danger or hazard to aircraft landing at the said airport,\" and again:\u2014\nthe said officers and servants of the Crown owed a duty to the suppliant to construct and maintain an airport fit for landing, and the suppliants say that it was the duty of the said officers and servants to see to it that the said ditch was properly filled and protected and adequately marked, but failed in the performance of that duty while acting within the scope of their employment by allowing the said ditch or excavation to remain open as aforesaid and without adequate markings.\nThe appellants did not plead that there was any duty owing to them by the Crown but, showing a proper appreciation of their legal position, founded their claims on the alleged negligence of officers or servants of the Crown under subsection (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nWhile the claims as thus pleaded appear to be directed to the acts and defaults of the officers and servants of the Crown who, it was contended, caused the ditch to be excavated, and allege apparently a continuing duty on their part after its construction to see that it was protected and adequately marked, and are not directed to those of the officers or servants who were in charge of the airport at the time of the accident, I think, in view of the course of the trial in which inquiry was made without objection as to the identity and duties of various officers and employees of the Department of Transport at the time of the accident, that they should be considered as if a duty on the part of some or more of these persons towards the plaintiff had been pleaded and put in issue. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Cameron and dismissed on the ground that the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of the appellant Grossman. In arriving at this conclusion, the learned trial judge considered that the legal relationship existing between the Crown and Grossman was that of licensor and licensee and that the respective obligations of the parties were defined by cases such as Fairman v. Perpetual Building Society 31, and Mersey Docks v. Procter 32. Accordingly, on the footing that the Crown owed a duty to warn Grossman of the danger from the open ditch, only if it was not known to him or obvious if he had used reasonable care, and that he had failed to use such care, the action failed. With great respect for the opinion of the learned trial judge, I do not think the issues in the present case are to be determined on the basis that the Crown owed the appellants any such duty. The Crown owes no duty to the subject qua owner or occupier of property and it will be noted that no such claim is advanced in the petition of right. The matter must be decided, in my humble opinion, upon other principles.\nThe jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to hear and determine claims against the Crown for injury to the person or to property, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, and the right of the subject to recover damages for loss so occasioned were established in Canada by section 16(c) of c. 16 of the Statutes of 1887. The history of this enactment has been traced by Duff C.J. in The King v. Dubois 33. In the form in which it now appears after the amendment made by s. 1 of c. 28 of the Statutes of 1938, it is s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act (c. 34, R.S.C. 1927). Prior to the Act of 1887 it had been decided by this Court in The Queen v. McFarlane 34, following Canterbury v. The Attorney General 35 and Tobin v. The Queen 36, that the Crown was not liable for injuries occasioned by the negligence of its servants or officers and that the rule respondeat superior did not apply in respect of the wrongful or negligent acts of those engaged in the public service. Of the many cases in which the effect of the section, in so far as it touches the present matter, is concerned, it is only necessary, in my opinion, to refer to three.\nIn The King v. Canada Steamship Lines 37, the steamship company claimed to recover for loss sustained in consequence of the collapse of a landing slip on a government wharf at Tadoussac. The pleadings alleged negligence on the part of various persons in the employ of the Department of Public Works. One Brunet, an assistant government engineer in the Quebec office of the department, whose duties required him from time to time to make inspections of Dominion government properties, had, some three days prior to the accident, landed at the wharf in company with a number of passengers from a vessel of the steamship company, and he said that the condition of the slip aroused apprehension in his mind for the safety of the passengers. On the following morning, he made what Anglin C.J. described, in delivering the judgment of the court, as a casual and perfunctory examination of the wharf, and, after requesting one Imbeau to examine the slip and make a written report, left Tadoussac. Imbeau who, it appears, was engaged as a foreman by the department, whenever government work was done at Tadoussac, but was not a regular employee, made an examination of the wharf and reported to the district engineer on July 7th that he had found the slip was in a very dangerous condition. On the same date the accident which gave rise to the claims occurred. The judgment in this Court found liability in the Crown. After saying that, had Imbeau been in the employ of the government when he inspected the slip on the 6th of July, his failure either to bar access to the slip or, if he had not authority to do so, to advise the department by telegram of the imminent danger, or at least to warn the responsible officers of the Canada Steamship Lines against making further use of the slip until it had been put in a safe condition, would have amounted to negligence which would have imposed liability upon the Crown, it was said that the evidence did not sufficiently establish that Imbeau was an officer or servant of the Crown, within the meaning of section 20(c) (now 19(c)) of the Exchequer Court Act. The fault of Brunet which imposed the liability was thus described:\u2014\nThe case of Brunet is quite different. He was undoubtedly an officer or servant of the Crown. He came to Tadoussac in the discharge of his duties or employment. He saw the use that was being made of the slip which afterwards collapsed and immediately realized that its condition was dubious and had reason, as he says, to \"fear\" for its safety. He was told by Imbeau that there should be an inspection \"comme il faut\" of the slip because it might be \"endommag\u00e9\"\u2014to see if it were not also in bad condition. Instead of clearing up his suspicions by an immediate personal inspection, or at least promptly reporting his fears to Quebec, or warning the officers of the steamship company of the probable danger of using the slip in its then condition, he contented himself with asking Imbeau to make an inspection and to report the result in writing to Quebec. In taking the risk of allowing the continued use of the wharf pending such report and in failing to give any warning to the officers of the steamship company Brunet was in my opinion guilty of a dereliction of duty amounting to negligence on his part as an officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work.\nIn The King v. Hochelaga Shipping and Towing Company, Limited 38, the owner of a towboat claimed damages from the Crown for injuries sustained by the vessel in striking a portion of the outer cribwork and rock ballast of a jetty projecting from the Dominion government breakwater at Port Morien, Nova Scotia. While the jetty was under construction a portion of it had been swept away by a storm and, in the result, the cribwork and ballast referred to were submerged, their presence being apparently unknown to those in charge of the towboat. At the trial in the Exchequer Court the Crown was held liable. Angers J. found liability in the Crown under section 19(c) in the following terms:\u2014\nAfter a careful perusal of the evidence I have come to the conclusion that the accident is attributable to the negligence of officers or servants of the Crown, namely the district engineer and the assistant engineer under whose supervision the construction of the jetty and its reparation after the top part of the outer end thereof had been partially washed away were effected, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work.\nOn the appeal to this Court, Duff C.J. said: (p. 155)\u2014\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the submerged cribwork which, after the superstructure of the jetty had been carried away, was left with nothing to warn navigators of its presence, constituted a dangerous menace to navigation; and that in leaving this obstruction without providing any such warning the officials concerned are chargeable with negligence for which the Crown is responsible by force of section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nCrocket J., with whom Rinfret J. (as he then was) and Kerwin J. agreed, after referring to the finding of negligence made at the trial, said that he agreed that the collision: (p. 163)\u2014\nwas attributable to such negligence on the part of officers and servants of the Crown, while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work as rendered the Crown responsible therefor under the provisions of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. It was not a case of mere non-repair or non-feasance, but of the actual creation of a hidden menace to navigation by a Department of the Government through its fully authorized officers and servants in the construction of a public work.\nDavis J. said in part: (p. 170)\u2014\nWhat is contended for by the Crown is that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction because there could be no duty on the Crown to remove the submerged pile of balast ; consequently no duty on any officers or servants of the Crown to remove it and a fortiori no negligence on the part of officers or servants of the Crown in not removing it. But I agree with the view taken by the learned trial judge on the evidence, that is, that in the restoration and changes made in the jetty, there was negligence on the part of the officers or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon the public work.\nIn The King v. Anthony 39, the claim advanced against the Crown was for a loss from fire started by a tracer bullet fired through the window of a barn by a private soldier. It was shown that at the time of the occurrence this man, in company with two non-commissioned officers, was driving along a road, the men being under orders not to fire except upon the command of a superior officer. The man whose act caused the damage had, at least once before he came to Anthony's property, fired live ammunition, and the contention of the suppliant was that the failure of the noncommissioned officers to prevent him from firing was negligence of the nature referred to in section 19(c) and imposed liability. The suppliant succeeded at the trial but this judgment was reversed and the action dismissed on the appeal to this Court. Rand J., with whose judgment Rinfret C.J. and Hudson J. agreed, in dealing with the liability imposed by the subsection, said in part: (p. 571)\u2014\nI think it must be taken that what paragraph (c) does is to create a liability against the Crown through negligence under the rule of respondeat superior, and not to impose duties on the Crown in favour of subjects: The King v. Dubois 40 at 394 and 398; Salmo Investments Ltd. v. The King 41, at 272 and 273. It is a vicarious liability based upon a tortious act of negligence committed by a servant while acting within the scope of his employment; and its condition is that the servant shall have drawn upon himself a personal liability to the third person.\nAfter saying that if the liability were placed merely on the negligent failure to carry out a duty to the Crown and not on a violation of a duty to the injured person, there would be imposed on the Crown a greater responsibility in relation to a servant than rests on a private citizen, Rand J. said further (p. 572) :\nThis raises the distinction between duties and between duty and liability. There may be a direct duty on the master toward the third person, with the servant the instrument for its performance. The failure on the part of the servant constitutes a breach of the master's duty for which he must answer as for his own wrong; but it may also raise a liability on the servant toward the third person by reason of which the master becomes responsible in a new aspect. The latter would result from the rule of respondeat superior; the former does not.\nThe majority of the Court considered that the non-commissioned officers owed no such duty towards the suppliant, as was contended for. Kerwin and Estey JJ. dissented, they both being of the opinion that one of these non-commissioned officers, one Williams, a sergeant major, owed a duty to the suppliant to prevent the men under his charge from firing and that, accordingly, the Crown was liable. In the Canada Steamship's case the evidence as to the scope of Brunet's duty was meagre and whether he was vested with authority to prevent the further use of the wharf for the purpose of landing passengers until it was rendered safe for use does not appear and, whether the \"dereliction of duty\" referred to in the passage from the judgment of Anglin C.J., above referred to, was of a duty owed to the Crown as his employer, or one which he owed to the steamship company or other persons who might utilize the wharf as a place to land, is not stated. Neither the various judgments written nor the written arguments filed by the parties in that case or in the Hochelaga case indicate that the question as to whether any officer or servant of the Crown had incurred personal liability was argued.\nSome two years before this accident, extensive improvements and additions to this airport were made at the instance of the Department of Reconstruction and Supply of Canada. Under a contract dated June 25, 1946, made between His Majesty, represented by the minister of that department, and Tomlinson Construction Company, Ltd., a contractor, the latter undertook, inter alia, the construction of two concrete landing strips, each something more than a mile in length, and the excavation of the open ditches for the purpose of draining water from these strips, this being effected by a system of buried pipes draining into the ditches. Mr. Edward F. Cook, the district airways engineer of the Department of Transport at Winnipeg, supervised the construction of these and other works necessary for the operation of an airport by the contractor. The plan of having these open ditches which were some 48 ft. in width and varied from 7 to 11 ft. in depth was no doubt that of the professional advisers of the Department and was obviously approved and adopted on behalf of the Crown by the minister. Such open ditches situate some 600 ft. from the hard-surface runways as a means of drainage were adopted at other airports constructed for the department at The Pas, Weyburn, Brandon, Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg. It is not suggested that Cook was himself responsible for the opening of these great ditches, nor charged with any duty in respect of them other than to see that the work was properly done by the contractor, nor that he had any continuing duty in regard to them afterwards. The work was not done by any officer or servant of the Crown but by an independent contractor under the terms of this contract. There was, however, at the airport an employee of the department by the name of Nicholas who was described as the airport maintenance foreman, a position which he had occupied for some time prior to 1946. In giving evidence he said that his duty was to supervise the airport and maintain it in good condition and, if it was necessary, to put up any markings to give instructions for this to be done. According to him, he had caused to be placed 18 or 20 red woolen flags approximately 2 ft. by 3 ft. in area on posts in the vicinity of the open ditches to indicate their presence. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the petition of right which, for the reasons above indicated, I think should be taken as directed to the conduct of Nicholas, it is alleged that he owed a duty to the suppliants to properly fill in, protect and adequately mark the ditches. There was apparently no officer of the Department of Transport, senior to Nicholas at Saskatoon, concerned with the operation of the airport, but it cannot be seriously suggested that he could have directed that the ditch, constructed under the direction of the Minister for these purposes, be filled in. I do not understand what is meant by the allegation that it was his duty to see that the ditch was properly \"protected.\" The suppliants' claims must, therefore, be based upon the contention that Nicholas owed a duty to them and to other people who might resort with their planes to the airport to warn them of the presence of the ditch, and that the damages claimed resulted from a breach of this duty.\nThe question as to the liability of a servant of the Crown occupying a position such as that of Nicholas is not, I think, decided by the judgments of this Court in the Canada Steamship and Hochelaga cases, where the question of the personal liability of such officers or servants was not argued or, so far as the judgments rendered indicate, considered. Since the claims are based upon the alleged negligence of Nicholas, the appellants must establish that he owed a duty to them to warn them of the presence of the ditch. It is, of course, not sufficient that under his contract of employment with the Crown it was his duty to see that any dangers, obstacles or obstructions on the airport be marked, so as to warn aviators of their presence. Nicholas was neither the owner, occupant or operator of the airport and no liability in any such capacity can be asserted against him. The claim, therefore, is clearly not for an act of misfeasance but of alleged non-feasance.\nIn Adams v. Naylor 42, which was decided in the House of Lords a few weeks earlier than the decision of this Court in Anthony's case, a claim was advanced against an officer of the Royal Engineers for injuries sustained by children in a mine field laid by the military authorities as a measure for the defence of the country. It was the practice in England, under such circumstances when a Crown servant might be involved, for the Crown on request to supply the name, for example, of the driver of a Crown vehicle or the navigating officer of a Crown ship at the time of an accident, and in this matter the Crown, when appealed to by the plaintiffs to furnish the name of the Crown servant who was in charge of the mine field and responsible for its maintenance, gave the name of Captain Naylor. In the Court of Appeal 43, in addition to considering the effect of the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act 1939, which the Crown contended was an answer to the action, there was a lengthy discussion as to whether the children who had gone into the mine field without permission were trespassers and, if so, the nature of the duty owed to them as such. In the House of Lords Viscount Simon, after saying that, in his opinion, the action was barred by the provisions of the statute, pointed out that apart from that question the issues were not really issues between the plaintiffs and the Crown, the point being as to whether there was personal liability on the part of Captain Naylor. As to this he said in part (p. 550) :\nThe courts before whom such a case as this comes have to decide it as between the parties before them and have nothing to do with the fact that the Crown stands behind the defendant. For the plaintiffs to succeed, apart from the statute, they must prove that the defendant himself owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs and has failed in discharging that duty. Whether the plaintiffs in the present case would succeed in doing this it is superfluous to inquire, since the decision goes against them on other grounds; but it may be useful to put on record, in passing, that the success of the plaintiffs would depend on establishing the personal liability of the defendant to them, as the Crown is not in any sense a party to the action.\nLord Simonds, who stated his agreement with Viscount Simon, said in part (p. 553) :\nI must confess that, had it not been for the fact that the Act under consideration afforded a defence to the action, I should myself have had great difficulty in understanding what was the duty alleged to be due from the defendant, an officer of His Majesty's army, to a member of the public in respect of acts done or omitted to be done in course of his military service.\nLord Uthwatt pointed out that the case had been treated in the Court of Appeal as if the defendant was the occupier of the land and that it was not open to the parties to the suit by agreement to have the matter dealt with on what was shown to be a false footing. The allegation made in the statement of claim as to Naylor's connection with the matter was that he was the officer of the Royal Engineers \"in control and responsible for the maintenance and safeguarding of the mine field\", but the case pleaded had not been dealt with.\nThere is no statute in England corresponding to section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act imposing liability upon the Crown and apart from the issue as to the application of the Personal Injuries Act the question to be determined was the same as in the present case. Where the claim advanced against an officer or servant of an employer is for misfeasance, the issue of liability does not, of course, depend upon the existence of that relationship: it is the commission of the tortious act which gives the right of action. In Lane v. Cotton 44, the action was brought against the Postmaster General for the recovery of certain Exchequer bills which had been contained in a letter delivered to a clerk at the post office and lost. Holt C.J., who disagreed with the majority, he being of the opinion that the Postmaster General was liable, in referring to the liability of the clerk and officer of the post office appointed \"to take in and deliver out\" letters at the London Post Office, said in part (p. 489) :\nIt was objected at the bar that they have this remedy against Breese. I agree, if they could prove that he took out the bills they might sue him for it; so they might any body else on whom they could fix that fact; but for a neglect in him they can have no remedy against him; for they must consider him only as a servant; and then his neglect is only chargeable on his master, or principal; for a servant or deputy, quatenus such cannot be charged for neglect, but the principal only shall be charged for it; but for a misfeasance an action will lie against a servant or deputy, but not quatenus a deputy or servant, but as a wrong-doer. As if a bailiff, who has a warrant from the sheriff to execute a writ, suffer his prisoner by neglect to escape, the sheriff shall be charged for it, and not the bailiff; but if the bailiff turn the prisoner loose, the action may be brought against the bailiff himself, for then he is a kind of wrong-doer or refuser.\nIn Perkins v. Hughes 45, Lee C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, said in part (p. 41) :\nIn the case of; Lane v. Cotton 46, the following distinction, which, in our opinion, is well founded, was taken by Holt C.J. namely, that where an injury arises from the neglect of a servant, an action only lies against his master, for that a servant is not answerable, quatenus servant, for neglect: but that where an injury arises from the misfeasance of a servant, he is himself liable to an action, not quatenus servant, but as being a wrong-doer. In Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs 47, the House sum moned a Court of judges consisting of Blackburn, Keating and Shee JJ. and Channell B. and Pigott B., requesting them to answer two questions necessary to be determined in the action. The judgment of this Court written by Blackburn J., after referring to the judgment in Lane v. Cotton on the question as to the liability of a public officer for the negligence of his subordinates, said in part (p. 111) :\nBut these cases were decided upon the ground that the government was the principal, and the defendant merely the servant. If an action were brought by the owner of goods against the manager of the goods traffic of a railway company for some injury sustained on the line, it would fail unless it could be shewn that the particular acts which occasioned the damage were done by his orders or directions; for the action must be brought either against the principal, or against the immediate actors in the wrong.\nand referred to Story on Agency, s. 313, as authority for the statement.\nIn Smith on Master and Servant, 8th Ed. 288, the learned author, after saying that as a general rule all persons concerned in the wrong are liable to be charged as principals, states:\nBut for mere nonfeasance or omission of duty, a servant is not liable to answer in a civil action at the suit of third persons, but only to his own master, who, in accordance with the maxim already alluded to, \"Respondeat superior,\" is liable to answer for his servant's neglect. This distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance was thus stated by Lord Holt, in his celebrated judgment in Lane v. Cotton.\nThe statement of the law by Holt C.J. in Lane v. Cotton is referred to in Evans on Agency, 2nd Ed. 385, as the authority for the distinction between the liability of the employees for acts of misfeasance and of nonfeasance. In Story on Agency, 7th Ed. (1869) p. 385, the matter is dealt with as follows:\nThe distinction, thus propounded, between misfeasance and nonfeasance,\u2014between acts of direct, positive wrong and mere neglects by agents as to their personal liability therefor, may seem nice and artificial, and partakes, perhaps, not a little of the subtilty and over-refinement of the old doctrines of the common law. It seems however, to be founded upon this ground, that no authority whatsoever from a superior can furnish to any party a just defence for his own positive torts or trespasses; for no man can authorize another to do a positive wrong. But in respect to nonfeasances or mere neglects in the performance of duty, the responsibility therefor must arise from some express or implied obligation between particular parties standing in privity of law or contract with each other; and no man is bound to answer for any such violations of duty or obligation, except to those to whom he has become directly bound or amenabe for his conduct. Whether the distinction be satisfactory or not, it is well established, although some niceties and difficulties occasionally occur in its practical application to particular cases.\nIt may be useful to illustrate each of these propositions by some cases which have been treated as clear, or which have undergone judicial decision. And, in the first place, as to the non-liability of agents for their nonfeasances and omissions of duty, except to their own principals. Thus, if the servant of a common carrier negligently loses a parcel of goods, intrusted to him, the principal, and not the servant, is responsible to the bailor or the owner. So, if an under-sheriff is guilty of a negligent breach of duty, an action lies by the injured party against the high sheriff, and not against the deputy personally, for his negligence.\nIn the United States courts the accuracy of the above statement of the law in Lane v. Cotton appears to have been generally (though not universally) accepted. Thus, in Murray v. Usher 48, Andrews J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York, said in part:\nThe general rule of respondeat superior charges the master with liability for the servant's negligence, in the master's business, causing injury to third persons. They may in general treat the acts of the servant as the acts of the master. But the agent or servant is himself liable, as well as the master, where the act producing the injury, although committed in the master's business, is a direct trespass by the servant upon the person or property of another, or where he directs the tortious act. In such cases the fact that he is acting for another does not shield him from responsibility. The distinction is between misfeasance and nonfeasance. For the former, the servant is in general liable; for the latter, not. The servant, as between himself and his master, is bound to serve him with fidelity, and to perform the duties committed to him. An omission to perform them may subject third persons to harm, and the master to damages. But the breach of the contract of service is a matter between the master and servant alone; and the nonfeasance of the servant causing injury to third persons is not, in general at least, a ground for a civil action against the servant in their favour. Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 488; Perkins v. Smith, 1 Wils. 328; Bennett v. Bayes, 5 Hurl. & N. 391; Smith, Mast. & Serv. 216, and cases cited.\nThe same view of the law is expressed in the judgment of Martin J.49, where the portion of the judgment of Andrews J. above quoted was approved and adopted. In Kelly v. Chicago & Alton Railway Co.50, where a yard-master in the employ of the railway company was joined as a party defendant, the plaintiff alleging that he had neglected to make an inspection of the engine which had exploded and caused injuries, Philips J., referring to the above quoted passage from Story on Agency, held that the action did not lie. In my opinion, if there was failure on the part of Nicholas to cause adequate measures to be taken to warn aviators resorting to the Saskatoon Airport in their planes of the presence of the open ditch and if such failure caused or contributed to the accident, Nicholas is not personally liable and, accordingly, the action against the Crown should fail. The appellants' case cannot be placed upon a higher plane than it would be if Nicholas had been in the employ of a private person or a corporation, and in neither event would he, in my judgment, be personally liable, though the owner, occupant or operator of the airport might be. The appellants' difficulties are increased by the fact that the employer of Nicholas owed no such duty, as is asserted, against him to the appellants, but it appears to be unnecessary to deal with this aspect of the matter. For the contrary view, it may be said that aviators resorting to government aerodromes where they are at least permitted, if not invited, to land, are entitled to assume that some officer or servant employed by the government will take such steps as are necessary to warn them of danger from obstacles upon an airport and that this imposes liability on those employees of the Crown charged by it with that duty. I do not know how far it would be suggested that this liability should extend. Presumably, the officers of the Department of Transport whose duties would include that of seeing that Nicholas properly discharged his duties of maintenance at the airport and the government inspectors, if there were such, who inspected the airport facilities from time to time and who may have observed the warning flags exhibited and failed to do anything to remedy their inadequacy, if they were inadequate, would be involved in liability. Such a contention is not supported by authority, in my opinion.\nWith deference to contrary opinions, I do not think the point in this matter is affected by the decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson 51. In that case a shop assistant sought to recover damages from a manufacturer of aerated waters for injuries suffered as a result of consuming part of the contents of a bottle of ginger beer which had been manufactured by the respondent and which contained the decomposed remains of a snail. There was no claim against any employee of the manufacturer and the only point decided was as to the duty which the latter owed to the ultimate consumer of his product. While Lord Atkin, in dealing generally with the law of negligence, said in part:\nYou must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.\nthis, standing alone, is insufficient as a guide since there remains to be determined who is my neighbour. I am unable to believe that either this language or anything else said by Lord Atkin or by any of the other Law Lords who gave the majority decision in that case was intended to change the law as to the personal liability of an employee towards third persons injured by some failure on his part to perform a duty imposed upon him by his contract of employment. No such question arose for decision and the matter was not discussed either in the judgments or in the argument. There has been much discussion as to the exact point decided in the judgment of the majority of the court in Donoghue's case. There is an interesting discussion of the subject in the 14th edition of Pollock on Torts, pp. 344-5-6. I agree with the learned author that Lord Wright's statement as to this in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. 52, should be accepted, where, after referring to the decision in Donoghue's case and saying that their Lordships, like the judges in the courts of Australia, would follow it, said in part:\nThe only question here can be what that authority decides and whether this case comes within its principles * * * Their Lordships think that the principle of the decision is summed up in the words of Lord Atkin:\n\"A manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.\"\nThe decision so summarized does not touch the point in the present case.\nIn the course of the able argument of Mr. Cuelenaere for the appellants, he referred to the Air Regulations enacted under the provisions of the Aeronautics Act, c. 3, R.S.C. 1927, which, inter alia, prescribe certain ground markings to be exhibited on public aerodromes open to public use. These regulations cannot, in my opinion, affect the matter, since the aerodrome in question was operated by the Crown. Section 15 of the Interpretation Act, c. 1, R.S.C. 1927, declares that no provision or enactment in any. Act shall affect, in any manner whatsoever the rights of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that His Majesty shall be bound thereby. The Aeronautics Act contains no such provision and while the regulations are declared to apply to state aircraft they do not assume to deal with the manner in which aerodromes operated by the Crown are to be marked.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellants' claim to recover against the Crown is based upon section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act as amended, by which that Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to the property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. It must now be taken as settled by this Court in Anthony v. The King 53, that the Crown's officer or servant must owe a duty to the third person, the breach of which would make him liable to that third party before the Crown's responsibility could attach under the section ; that is, the rule respondeat superior applies. Philip R. Nicholas was the airport maintenance foreman and that in doing what he did, at the Saskatoon Airport, he was acting within the scope of his duties or employment does not, I think admit of doubt, and in my view he owed a duty to Grossman not to leave the ditch across the grass runways undesignated by something observable from the air that would give an intending user of the field warning of the danger.\nThe Saskatoon Airport did not have tower control and it should, therefore, have been within the contemplation of Nicholas that a flier, intending to alight on a public airport, such as that at Saskatoon, would use the grasss landing strip while the cement one was being repaired. The decision of the House of Lords in Bolton v. Stone 54, must be taken as a decision on its own particular facts. This was a case where Miss Stone, while on a highway abutting a cricket ground, was injured by a ball hit by a player thereon. The House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and restored the judgment at the trial on the ground that although the possibility of the ball being hit on the highway might reasonably have been foreseen, that was not sufficient, as the risk of injury to anyone in such a place was so remote that a reasonable person would not have anticipated it. While the result to the unfortunate plaintiff was disastrous, there is nothing to indicate that the well-known rule as exemplified in Donoghue v. Stevenson 55, was departed from, viz., that you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be liable to injure your neighbour. In my opinion the present case falls within that rule.\nIt is said that a mere act of omission by Nicholas would not be sufficient, and reference is made to the dissenting judgment of Lord Holt in Lane v. Cotton 56, where he states: \"but for a neglect in him (a servant) they can have no remedy against him; for they must consider him only as a servant and then his negligence is only chargeable on his master or principal; for a servant or deputy, quatenus such, cannot be charged for negligence but the principal only shall be charged for it.\" This distinction sometimes referred to as the difference between misfeasance and nonfeasance has been generally recognized both in England and in the United States although not without some exceptions in the courts of the latter. The true rule, however, is I think that which distinguishes those cases where an agent is not liable in tort to third persons who have suffered a loss because of the agent's failure to perform some duty which he owed to his principal alone, from those cases where, in addition to a duty owing to the principal, the agent owed a duty to the third party. As Viscount Simon stated in Adams v. Naylor 57, the question whether the defendant in that case was personally liable was, of course, a question for the Court on the evidence. In view of the basis of liability according to modern concepts in actions for tort, it should be held in the present case that Nicholas in either placing the flags, or permitting them to be placed or to remain in place, committed a negli gent act for which he could be held liable at the suit of Grossman. That, I think, is consonant with the judgment of this Court delivered by Chief Justice Anglin in The King v. Canada Steamships Lines Ltd. 58, where it is stated: \"In taking the risk of allowing the continued use of the wharf pending such report, and in failing to give any warning to the officers of the steamship company, Brunet was in my opinion guilty of a dereliction of duty amounting to negligence on his part.\" Leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee was refused. The view I have expressed is also consistent with the decision in The King v. Hochelaga Shipping and Towing Company, Limited 59. In the reasons of the majority, delivered by Crocket J., it is stated that the collision that had occurred \"was not a case of mere nonrepair or nonfeasance but of the actual creation of a hidden menace to navigation by a department of the government through its fully authorized officers and servants in the construction of a public work.\"\nI quite agree that in these two cases the point now under discussion was apparently not raised acutely but those decisions may, I think, be justified on the ground I have suggested.\nAs to what Grossman did, I am content to adopt the reasons of my brother Taschereau but I might emphasize that while the trial judge had a view of the airport, conditions had changed since the day of the occurrence, and, in any event, he had only such evidence as was given before him as to what, on the day in question, was observable from the air. My brother Taschereau has also dealt with that aspect of the matter and I agree with what he has said.\nI would allow Grossman's appeal and direct judgment to be entered in his favour for $7,003.90, the amount of his damages fixed by the trial judge. Grossman is entitled to his costs of the action and appeal. As the total amounts claimed by Sun is $440, this Court has no jurisdiction under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act to hear his appeal which should be quashed without costs.\nTaschereau J. :\u2014The suppliants in their petition allege that on the 19th of July, 1948, they took off from the airport at the city of Prince Albert, province of Saskatchewan, to fly to the city of Saskatoon, and that on arriving at the said airport, they ran into a ditch or excavation running across the used portion of the airport. As a result, Grossman's aircraft was demolished and Sun, the passenger, suffered bodily injuries.\nGrossman claimed from His Majesty the King, in the rights of the Dominion of Canada, owner of the airport, the value of the plane, plus $785 for expenses, making a total of $7,705. Sun's claim amounted to $440 for personal injury. The Exchequer Court dismissed both claims with costs, hence the present appeal.\nGrossman, who is a resident of DesMoines, Iowa, U.S.A., was the owner of the craft, a Stinson Station Wagon, registered under No. N.C. 893C, with the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and on the date of the mishap, was the holder of a pilot's license, since May, 1946. He was an experienced pilot, having flown previously approximately 450 hours. On this particular occasion, he had entered Canada from the United States at Winnipeg and had stopped at Lethbridge, Calgary, Bienfait, before leaving Prince Albert to go to Saskatoon. He left Prince Albert at about 2:30 p.m. when the flying conditions were good; the wind was blowing lightly from the southeast, and as he says in his evidence, the ceiling was \"ideal\".\nHe flew at a level of 3,000 feet above the ground, and of about 4,500 to 5,000 feet above sea level. He was in possession of a map previously obtained from a Canadian Airport at Melfort, called \"The Saskatoon-Prince Albert-Saskatchewan-Area\", which indicated that the Saskatoon airport was a public airport. At a distance of approximately 15 miles from Saskatoon, Grossman started to reduce his altitude to 2,500 feet, and as he reached the airport he flew at 1,500 feet. As the airplane was equipped with a two-way radio, he tuned into tower frequency 275 K.O.L. which is the universal control frequency, but as there was no tower control in operation at Saskatoon, he received no answer. He had no trouble in finding the airport even from a great distance, as the visibility was very good. He was aware that new runways had been built recently, and he states that he could see them very well from the air. One runs northwest, southeast, and the other approximately east-west. They extend for a distance of over 3,000 feet, and are hard surfaced strips capable of being used by the heaviest planes. To the east of these new strips are the old R.C.A.F. runways, north of which, in the northeast corner of the airport, is a grass landing strip running north-south, and a small building on the east, owned by the Canadian Pacific Air Lines. This grass air field is used by the Saskatoon Flying Club, the Saskatchewan Air Lines, and some other light planes which frequently land at that particular place. It is to be noticed that the boundary markings used on that grass landing ground were still there at the date of the accident.\nWhen Grossman spotted the airport, he made what is called a \"pass over the field.\" He looked at the windsock, and made a turn and planned to land on one of the new runways, but as he saw men at work, he regained altitude and continued his flight, proceeded east and then north, when he observed a building with the word \"Airport\" printed in large letters on the roof, and to the west of this building, that part of the grass surface of the airport used as runways. Continuing north, he then turned towards the west and then to the south, and made his landing well down on the north-south strip, and he testifies that he gave himself more than adequate space to complete his landing before arriving at the building, where he intended to bring his plane to a stop. The evidence reveals that he made a 3-point stall landing at 55 miles per hour, and was rolling along the grass runways, when he suddenly realized that there was an obstruction in front of him. He decided to attempt a take-off, but did not succeed in lifting his craft, and his under-carriage caught the south side of a ditch and his plane crashed into the ground.\nThis airport was originally operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, but after the last war, was taken over by the Department of Transport, when it was decided to build the two new hard surfaced strips, which were in use long before the date of the accident. It was then deemed necessary to provide for adequate drainage, and a sum of approximately one million dollars was expended. large open ditch was dug about 2,000 feet in length, 48 feet wide, and varying in depth from 7 to 11 feet, intersecting the old gras strip at right angles, at 2,800 feet from the north limit of the airport, but, it was found too expensive to fill it. It is in evidence that those in charge, allowed grass and weeds to grow on both sides of the ditch, making it harder to detect its location from the air; approximately 17 to 18 flags were placed on each side of the ditch to indicate an actual danger, known to those in charge of the field, but which oncoming pilots could not easily ascertain, unless sufficiently informed.\nThe suppliants contend that the warning was insufficient, and with this submission I agree. Philip R. Nicholas, the airport maintenance foreman, admitted in his evidence that the danger resulting from the presence of the ditch was discussed and that complaints had been received with respect thereto. As to the flags which he placed in 1946, in order to warn oncoming planes, he is \"not just too sure as to how distinguishable they were\". He admitted, after comparing the exhibits, which were photographs of the ditch and of the flags, that the flags and posts present at the time of the trial, were considerably more numerous than those which existed in July, 1948, the month in which the accident happened. Many witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant and of the respondent as to the visibility of these flags and of the ditch from the air. Some say that they were hardly visible, that the ditch could be mistaken for a roadway; some others, that it is possible to detect it, flying at a height of 600 to 800 feet. As to the appellant Grossman, he is very emphatic in his evidence that he did not see the flags or the ditch.\nIt is undisputable that a public airport, as this one was, must offer a standard of security, at least equal to the one required by the regulations enacted by the competent authorities. (P.C. 2129). Air Regulations provide:\n12. At every land aerodrome open to public use, the boundaries of the landing area shall, by means of suitable markings, be rendered clearly visible both to aircraft in the air and to aircraft manoeuvring on the landing area. In addition, a circle marking may be placed on the landing area. All obstructions existing on a landing area shall be clearly marked. In case part of the marked landing area should become unfit for use, this part shall be delimited by clearly visible markings or flags, and may, in addition be indicated by one or more clearly visible crosses.\nAir Regulation 13 says:\u2014\n13. (d) (1) When special circumstances call for a prohibition to land liable to be prolonged, use shall be made of a red square panel, placed horizontally, each side of which measures at least 10 feet and the diagonals of which are covered by yellow strips at least 20 inches in width, arranged in the form of an X;\n(2) When the bad state of the landing area or any other reason calls for the observance of certain precautions in landing, use may be made of a red square panel, placed horizontally, each side of which measures at least 10 feet and one of the diagonals of which is covered by a yellow strip at least 20 inches in width;\nThese requirements were surely not fulfilled in the present case, and I have reached the conclusion, that the obstruction on the landing field was not sufficiently clearly indicated. These small flags were most probably visible from the ground, and could serve as a warning for a take-off, but it is common knowledge, and the preponderance of evidence so reveals, that from the air, placed as they were on perpendicular posts, their efficacy was practically nil. Leslie Deane, superintendent of maintenance and operations for the Saskatchewan Government Airways, flew the day after the accident to the Saskatoon Airport, and he testifies that he could not see the flags, nor detect the ditch. I quite agree that a pilot familiar with that airport, and consequently aware of the existence of this obstruction, could from the air realize the obviousness of the danger, but it was Grossman's first attempt to land on that field, which he could expect to find in a safe condition, unless otherwise properly and efficiently cautioned. Airfields must offer sufficient safety not merely to those who have knowledge of the actual danger they may present, but also to those who, unaware of an existing and insufficiently made known peril, use their facilities for the first time. In Imperial Airways Limited v. National Flying Services, which is an English case but reported in U.S. Aviation Reports, 1933, at page 50, an aircraft was damaged falling through the cover over a concealed stream running across the middle of an aerodrome. It was held by Lord Hewart that the proprietors of an aerodrome, are under obligation to see that the aerodrome is safe for use by such aircraft as are entitled to use it, and that a proper warning of any danger of which they knew or ought to have known must be given.\nIt is said on behalf of the Crown that if Grossman had dragged the field or made what has been called a \"dummy run\", he would have seen the obstruction, and avoided the accident. After having unsuccessfully attempted to land on the hard surfaced strip, on account of men being at work, the appellant made a circuit to reach the grass landing field. If, as suggested, making a \"dummy run\" means flying at a low level, all across the field, to find possible obstructions, this would amount to a violation of Air Regulations 41 and 42 which read as follows:\n41. If an aerodyne starting from or about to land on an aerodrome makes a circuit or partial circuit, the turning must be made clear of the landing area and must be left-handed (anti-clockwise), so that during such circuit the landing area shall always be on its left.\n42. (b) Landings shall be preceded by a descent in a straight line, commenced at least 3,000 feet outside the perimeter of the landing area;\nThe appellant followed, I think, the recognized and proper method in landing. He made an anti-clockwise circuit of the field, and descended in a straight line towards what appeared to be a safe marked grass strip, made a successful landing and was rolling on the ground towards the hangars when the accident happened. What he did was in accordance with the regulations, and I cannot see that any negligence may be attributed to him. Mr. B. F. Burbridge, Inspector of the Department of Transport, Civil Aviation, who was called as a witness by the respondent, justifies in his evidence what Grossman has done when he attempted to land. He states that a pilot must not cross the airfield, but must fly around the boundaries of the airport. The only crossing allowed is to fly down the runway which is in use. He adds that it is not necessary for a pilot to make a \"dummy run\" over a particular runway if he has previously observed the field. This appears to be in complete harmony with the Air Regulations and the occurrences in the instant case.\nIt is also argued that appellant failed to obtain the necessary information as to the landing conditions of the field where he intended to land. Before leaving Prince Albert, he had with him an air navigation map supplied by the Department of Mines and Resources, indicating that the Saskatoon Airport was a public airport, which under the Air Regulations is a centre for air traffic, containing installations necessary for such traffic. He inquired as to the facilities of the airport, and from the information obtained it was reasonable for him to conclude that he would not later encounter the difficulties that he experienced with such unfortunate results. Upon approaching Saskatoon, while flying at a height of 2,500 feet, he attempted to contact the control tower but he received no answer. When there is a control tower, it is from there that the aerial traffic is governed, and all pilots are bound to comply with the instructions they receive from the operator. But when there is none, (and there are only 5 per cent of the used airports which are thus equipped) pilots must land after having taken the necessary precautions that ordinary prudent men would take under similar circumstances. There is no obligation sanctioned by law or by common practice to contact any other station called radio range or otherwise, which is not concerned with traffic, but mostly with weather conditions, particularly when there is no danger reasonably foreseeable, and nothing appears abnormal. It is by virtue of the regulations, the obligation of the airport itself to warn by clearly marked signs of any obstructions on the field, and not the duty of the pilot to inquire if any employee has been negligent, and if his life is in peril by accepting the implied invitation to land. (Vide International Civil Aviation Conference, 1944, sections 5 and 28). It would otherwise be tantamount to a total reversal of the respective duties and obligations imposed by law to the parties. Of course, it would be more efficient for the pilot to do so, but the law does not require such a high standard of care. Perfection in the actions or behaviour of men is not a condition sine qua non, to the right to claim damages. Motorists who drive on public highways, captains who bring their ships into port, are entitled to expect that the road will be in a safe condition, that there will not be any submerged object to obstruct navigation. King v. Hochelaga Shipping 60. Unless he knows of the danger, on account of its obviousness or otherwise, the driver of the automobile, or the captain of the ship is entitled to be warned of its existence. The right of a pilot of an aircraft, invited to land on a public airfield is identical.\nThe respondent further contends that even if Grossman was not negligent, the responsibility of the Crown cannot be involved. The basis of its liability could only be found in section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, which is as follows :\u2014\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to the property resuting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nDuring a period of many years this Court has determined what is the liability of the Crown as a result of the negligence of its employees, in circumstances similar to those with which we are now dealing.\nIn The King v. Canada Steamship Lines Limited 61, it was held that an employee of the Crown in allowing continued use of a wharf at Tadoussac, and in failing to give warning to the Steamship Company of the dangerous condition of the premises, was guilty of negligence as an \"officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment\", and that his neglect entailed the liability of the Crown for consequent injuries.\nIn The King v. Hochelaga Shipping Company, (cited supra) the employees of the Crown had left a submerged crib work near a government breakwater, that had broken away during a storm, with nothing to warn navigators of its presence. The Court decided that this obstruction constituted a dangerous menace to navigation, and that for not providing the necessary warning, the officials and servants of the Crown in charge of these works, were chargeable with negligence for which the Crown is responsible by force of section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nWhat this Court held in these two cases clearly indicates that the employees of the Crown failed in their duty to third parties, that their negligence, although arising only out of an omission to act, entailed their personal liability, and consequently the vicarious liability of the Crown. The Court was not merely confronted with cases of nonfeasance of acts which should have been done by the servant, as the result of a contract between the employer and the employee, and which would not involve the personal liability of the latter to third persons, but with the failure to perform a duty owed to the victims. (Halsbury, Vol. 22, page 255).\nThe Crown strongly relies on the more recent decision of this Court in The King v. Anthony 62. In that case, two aspects of the vicarious liability were considered. It was held firstly, that the act of the soldier in shooting an incendiary bullet into a barn, which eventually burnt, could, not be treated as an act of negligence committed while acting within the scope of his duties; it was a wilful act done for his own purpose, quite outside of the range of anything that might be called incidental to them. Secondly, it was said that the failure of the officer in charge of the group of soldiers, to prevent one of them from firing the shot, did not constitute a breach of private duty to the owner of the barn, and that the rule Respondeat Superior did not apply. His omission to exercise his authority was a breach of military law, for which he was accountable to his superiors, but his dereliction could not be considered as enuring to the private benefit of other persons. There were special circumstances which governed the Anthony case, which do not exist in the present instance. In the former, the personal liability of the officer in charge, an essential element to the application of the rule Respondeat Superior, was not shown to be present, but in the case at bar, we must, I think, necesarily be guided by the principles enunciated in The King v. Canada Steamship Lines, and The King v. Hochelaga (cited supra), which remained unaffected by what has been said in the Anthony case.\nIn these two cases, as in the present one, the negligence was the failure to warn of an existing danger that the employees of the Crown in the performance of their duty, knew or ought to have known, bringing into play section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. I would indeed be loath to hold that an employee of the Crown, whose concern it is to maintain an airfield in proper and safe condition, and to indicate by visible marks all dangerous obstructions, would not if he failed to do so, be neglectful of his duty to oncoming pilots whose welcome on Canadian soil has been sanctioned and recognized by an international agreement with foreign countries. It is from him that diligence and alertness is rightly expected. His lack of vigilance is a personal negligence, for which the \"Superior\" is answerable before the courts. It follows that the Crown must be held liable for the damage caused to the plane and for other losses incurred by plaintiff Grossman, to the extent of $7,003.90, as assessed by the trial judge for the purpose of the present appeal, although he dismissed the petition. The other petitioner Sun, is exactly in the same position as Grossman, but unfortunately his claim must be refused, as the amount involved is not sufficient to give jurisdiction to this Court to hear his appeal, and grant the remedy to which he would otherwise be entitled.\nI would therefore allow Grossman's appeal for $7,003.90 with costs throughout, and quash Sun's appeal without costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The airport here in question was at the relevant time owned and operated by the Crown. In what appears roughly to be its centre, two concrete strips had been built to accommodate very large aircraft. These strips run approximately north-west and south-east, and east and west respectively, intersecting at their northerly limits. Older concrete strips existed on the field prior to the making of the new strips. The new strips crossed the older ones at more than one point. There was also in the north-east corner of the airport area a grass landing strip running north and south, to the east of which and toward its northerly end there was a building owned by the Canadian Pacific Airlines, which had painted on its roof the word \"Airport\" clearly visible from the air. This grass landing strip was marked by some boundary markings which at the same time indicated to aircraft that the area further to the east and north was unfit for landing. The grass strip was used by the majority of the smaller and lighter types of planes. The plane of the appellant was of that type.\nAt the time the two new concrete strips were built in 1946, a large open ditch had been dug running south-easterly from the easterly end of the east-west strip for a distance of approximately 2,000 feet. This ditch was about 48 feet in width at the top and varied in depth from 7 to 11 feet. It cut through the grass strip at about right-angles at a point about 2,800 feet from the north limit of the airport, and about 1,300 feet from the south limit of the strip itself, where the hangars were situate. At the time of the accident, the raw wound originally made in the earth by the excavation had become covered by a growth of weeds, affecting its visibility considerably. The only marking of the ditch consisted in a number of posts about 10 feet high on which red flags had been placed. When originally placed, the posts were brightly painted, but at the time of the accident they had become quite dull and many of the original posts appear to have disappeared, the actual number in position at the time of the accident being quite uncertain. Some of the witnesses place this number as low as six. In the year following the accident, the posts were painted \"international orange and white\", and solid panels or frameworks capable of swinging a full circle were substituted for the flags.\nThe learned trial judge finds on the whole of the evidence that, at the time of the accident, pilots knowing of the existence of the ditch could readily locate its position, but that a pilot who did not know of its existence would have difficulty in seeing either the ditch or the flags unless he first flew over the field at a height of 1,000 feet or less.\nThe suppliant, before coming to the airport here in question, had, on entering Canada, landed at Stevenson airfield, Winnipeg, and had also made landings at Port Arthur, Melfort, Portage and Kenora. On an earlier trip he had also landed at Lethbridge, Calgary, Bienfait and Moose Jaw.\nThe day of the accident was bright and clear with a light, variable wind. At the time the appellant left Prince Albert the wind was south-easterly, and he testifies that that was still the direction as indicated by the air sock at the airport when he arrived at Saskatoon. There was evidence adduced by the respondent that its direction had changed to northerly, but the wind direction is not the subject of a finding. The learned trial judge considered that the ditch in question constituted\n\"an obstruction on the runway of a public airport.\"\nIn his view, failure to give adequate warning thereof to those lawfully using the facilities of the airport and exercising reasonable care, would constitute negligence for which the Crown could be liable under the provisions of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. He then considered the question as to the nature of the duty, if any, owed to the appellant in the circumstances, holding that as the airport was admittedly one open to public use, the appellant could not be considered a trespasser. He continues,\nThere is no evidence as to whether any fees were charged to the owners of airplanes which landed on the airport, or whether such services as the supplying of gas and oil or storage were supplied by the respondent or by tenants on the property.\nIn these circumstances, he was unable to find that the appellant was\n\"invited into the premises by the owner or occupier for some purpose of business or of material interest,\"\nand therefore came to the conclusion that the appellant was to be considered a licensee.\nThe evidence which the learned trial judge thought was lacking is, however, present. Exhibit 2 is a publication of the Department of Mines and Resources produced by the respondent. On the argument before us it was contended for the respondent that no part of this document had been put in evidence except the diagram of the airport. The document, in addition to the diagram, contains a good deal of information as to the airport, and includes the following:\n\"GROUND FACILITIES\nHangars\nAvailable\nFuel and Oil\nAvailable\"\nAll of this was placed in evidence by the respondent. I do not think, therefore, that the appellant can be treated as a mere licensee. He was an invitee. This renders inapplicable the view of the learned trial judge on the question as to the nature of the duty owed by the respondent to the appellant, namely, that the only duty on the part of the respondent was not to allow anything in the nature of a trap to exist.\nThe learned judge expressly finds, however, that it was well known to those in charge of the airport that that part of it north of the ditch, on which the appellant landed, was in daily use by a large number of light planes, and that it was the duty of the airport manager to mark any obstructions, the ditch being one.\nNicholas, who was in charge of the airport for the Crown testified that it was left to him to take all proper precautions with respect to the field and its markings. In 1946 he had placed the red cloth flags on the poles. These were the only markers or warnings placed at or near the ditch, and the fact that he did place them there indicates that he was alive to the danger constituted by the ditch.\nNicholas himself said that he had observed the ditch from the air after the flags had been put up, and deposed in this connection,\nQ. And did you particulary observe whether they could be seen from the air?\nA. I believe when they were first placed there I could see them from the air.\nQ. And later on you can't say?\nA. Later on I am not just too sure as to how distinguishable they were.\nWhile the learned judge found that\nthe existence of the old boundary markers there and of the building marked \"Airport\" would indicate to a pilot that there was there a small area available for landing,\nhe was of opinion that the\nproper practice to follow in approaching a strange landing area and where the facilities of the control tower or radio range are not used is that of \"dragging the field,\" or making a \"dummy run\" over the landing strip at such an altitude as would give full information as to existing conditions thereon.\nThis view of the learned trial judge is, of course, predicated upon the limited nature of the duty owed to the appellant. The duty of an occupier, however, toward an invitee is to take reasonable care that the premises are safe; Addie v. Dumbreck 63, per Lord Hailsham at 365. It is established beyond peradventure that the strip upon which the appellant landed was part of the area upon which the public flying light airplanes were invited to land and did land constantly. It is admitted also that the ditch was an obstruction and was recognized as such. The attempt made to mark it for the danger that it was, was quite insufficient. It is contended on the part of the respondent that the international air regulations are not binding upon it. Accepting that point of view, the regulations are nevertheless evidence of what measures were recognized in order to protect against obstructions, including those of the nature here in question. Part V, Section 2, deals with ground markings, Article 12 of which provides that\nAt every land aerodrome open to public use, the boundaries of the landing area shall, by means of suitable markings, be rendered clearly visible both to aircraft in the air and to aircraft manoeuvring on the landing area \u2026 All obstructions existing on a landing area shall be clearly marked. In case part of the marked landing area should become unfit for use, this part shall be delimited by clearly visible markings or flags, and may, in addition, be indicated by one or more clearly visible crosses.\nArticle 13(d) provides that\n(1) When special circumstances call for a prohibition to land liable to be prolonged, use shall be made of a red square panel, placed horizontally, each side of which measures at least 10 feet and the diagonals of which are covered by yellow strips at least 20 inches in width, arranged in the form of an X;\n(2) When the bad state of the landing area or any other reason calls for the observance of certain precautions in landing, use may be made of a red square panel, placed horizontally, each side of which measures at least 10 feet and one of the diagonals of which is covered by a yellow strip at least 20 inches in width;\nHow far short of this standard the posts and flags placed by Nicholas and allowed to disintegrate, falls, needs no comment. After the accident, new posts were put in on each side of the ditch and painted \"international\" orange and white, which the evidence shows is a clearly visible colour, and then, instead of cloth flags, a full panel of plywood painted red was placed on the posts in accordance with Article 13(d) (2). It cannot be said, in my opinion, on the evidence, that had this standard of care been observed, the appellant would not have seen the markings. In connection with his finding that it was the duty of the appellant to have made a \"dummy\" run over the landing area in which he landed before actually landing, the learned judge relies substantially on the evidence of the witness Burbridge, Inspector of Civil Aviation, Department of Transport. When giving evidence in chief on behalf of the Crown, this witness had said:\nQ. In your opinion what procedure should a pilot follow when landing on an unfamiliar airport?\nA. He should first of all land on a serviceable runway. If he is not familiar with that particular airport, if he never landed there before, if he is not in touch with flying surely he should make a dummy run on the landing strip on which he chooses to land.\nIt is plain to my mind that the witness, in his use of the word \"surely,\" is arguing rather than giving evidence as to an accepted standard of care. That that is so appears very clearly from his subsequent evidence. He continues :\nQ. What do you mean by a dummy run?\nA. To run over the area of the ground he intends to land on at a low altitude.\nQ. At what altitude?\nA. Any safe altitude.\nHis Lordship: What do you mean by that? Low enough to give him\u2014?\nA. Accurate vision.\nQ. Observation of the strip?\nA. Yes.\nHe is then referred to the experience which the appellant had in discovering Nicholas and his workmen putting asphalt on the large concrete strip on which he had proposed to land, and he gave the following evidence as to what he would have done :\nQ. What do you say you would have done if confronted with the same situation?\nA. Coming in I would have carried out a dummy run of the landing strip that was into the wind, finding out those vehicles and workmen on that strip I would have carried out another circuit over the same area at a low altitude. After a while on the next dummy run, if the workmen and vehicles were still on the runway I would have carried out a second dummy run, and a third dummy run, and if they were still there if in any hurry to get out I would have used the other runway, the grass one.\nIn cross-examination, however, he explains the above.\nQ. Coming down to conditions in Saskatoon, assuming you were coming in on the hard surface runway and you saw some men there, tell us what you think the pilot should have done.\nA. I have done that. Q. And you think he should have waved or signalled to the men?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Now, is it true that one or two courses would be open to him: either to signal to the men, or choose an alternative landing ground?\nA. That is right.\n* * *\nQ. Supposing there were two strips, both in the same direction and the pilot saw one strip he could land on, would it be ordinary practice for him under those circumstances not to make a dummy run, but simply just use the other runway?\nA. Provided he had surveyed the other strip.\nWith respect to the height at which this survey should be made, he had suggested, in chief, 100 feet from the ground. In cross-examination he gave the following evidence :\nQ. At what height should the dummy run be made?\nA. It is up to the capabilities of the pilot and the aircraft he is flying. Each pilot has his own capabilities.\nQ. Let us put it this way. In light aircraft, at what height would you say the dummy run should be made?\nA. With skill a pilot can carry out a dummy run at one hundred feet, provided there was no obstruction.\nQ. But a slightly less experienced pilot, he could do that higher, is that it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would you say that he could fly at six hundred feet or eight hundred feet?\nA. It is up to the individual pilot.\nQ. It is entirely up to the individual pilot?\nA. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. I think the regulations require a pilot to cross the airfield, do they not?\nA. No.\nQ. But it is a customary practice to cross an airfield?\nA. To cross an airfield?\nQ. To fly across an airfield?\nA. Provided he carries out a circuit, that is to say, he flies around the boundaries of the airport.\nQ. Is it customary to fly across an airfield and then make a circuit to land?\nA. Provided you are flying down the live runway which is in use.\nQ. What I am getting at is this: If a pilot sees a runway down on an airfield when he is making the circuit and there is no obstruction on it, would it be necessary for him to make a dummy run over that particular runway?\nA. No, provided he had surveyed from one end of the runway to the other, so he could observe the runway from one end to the other.\n* * * Q. Would you make a dummy run at one hundred feet over these hard surface runways?\nA. Not exactly one hundred. I would use my own discretion. You can sometimes see an airport ten miles out and would more or less figure in the air, within two miles you can more or less survey the runway. It depends on the visibility.\nQ. You can see it from quite a distance?\nA. Yes, according to the visibility.\nQ. Would you say it is common for people to make a dummy run at a very low altitude over airports?\nA. No, it is not common. The only time you would really get down low would be with bad visibility.\nQ. If it is good visibility you would not get down low?\nA. No, definitely. It is bad practice. You survey the runway from the altitude you think you can observe all obstructions on the ground.\nThis evidence speaks for itself. There is other evidence to the same effect.\nNeal, flying instructor of the Des Moines Flying Service, deposed:\nQ. Do you know what the expression \"dragging the field\" means?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What does it mean?\nA. That means to come down to a low altitude to observe the condition of the field as to landing. It is not a common practice at a controlled airport or municipal airport.\n* * *\nQ. Now, can you tell me, as an experienced pilot, when you drag a field, or drag an area?\nA. That, sir, comes in landing at any other field, other than an airport, where you don't know the condition previously.\nQ. What would you say as to the practice of dragging an airport from the safety factor?\nA. Dragging an airport from the safety factor would depend greatly on the amount of traffic going on around it. If there is not other traffic maybe it is safe, if there is, it is entirely unsafe.\nWith respect to the use of his radio, the appellant made the recognized call on the proper frequency as he approached the airfield, but there was no \"tower\" on that field and he got no reply. There was a \"radio range\" in operation at the field on a different frequency, and the witness Young, called by the Crown, who was in charge, said that if such a call had been made it would have been intercepted and answered by radio range, and the pilot given all information about the field. The same witness admits, however, that at the time when the appellant arrived at the field, he himself was working on the ground. He had an assistant who was supposed to be at the instrument, but Young admitted that this man might have been absent at the time. The assistant himself was not called. I see nothing, therefore, in this evidence to contradict the evidence of the appellant, or indicating any lack of care on his part in this respect.\nThe appellant approached the field at a height of 2,500 feet and crossed the boundary at 1,500 feet. The visibility was good. He saw the new concrete runways and observed the wind sock which indicated that the wind was still south-easterly. He turned to the north, decreased his elevation to 600 feet, turned again to the south-east and descended to 200 feet, when he had to abandon his intention to land owing to the presence of the workmen on the strip. He climbed back to 600 feet and turned left, presumably after crossing the south limit of the field, turned north and went up along the east boundary. He saw the building marked \"Airport\" and \"to the west of this building a grass landing strip marked available by conventional signs, wooden markers at the ends and at the cross points of the runways dissecting the landing strips.\" He made another left turn and then landed. As already pointed out, there was nothing in the way of adequate or recognized marking to indicate the presence of the ditch.\nIn my opinion, it is clear that Nicholas, who was left in charge of the field to place whatever markings on it good practice called for, failed in his duty to a person such as the appellant, and that this breach of duty was negligence for which the Crown is responsible under s. 19(c) of the statute.\nIn Dubois v. The King 64, Sir Lyman Duff said:\nMy view has always been that where you have a public work, in the sense indicated in the course of the preceding discussion, and any injury is caused through the negligence of some servant of the Crown in the execution of his duties or employment in the construction, the repair, the care, the maintenance, the working of such public work, you are not deforming the language of the section, as amended in 1917, by holding that such an injury comes within the scope of the statute; that is to say, that it is an injury due to the negligence of an employee of the Crown while acting in the scope of his duties or employment \"upon a public work.\" I have always thought, moreover, that the principle ought not to be applied in a niggardly way and that it ought to extend to the negligent acts of public servants necessarily or reasonably incidental to the construction, repair, maintenance, care, working of public works. Illustrations of the application of this principle in particular instances are to be found in Hochelaga v. The King 65, and Canada Steamships v. The King 66. Merely be cause the neglect which produces an injury is neglect of a duty owing to a master does not preclude its being also neglect of a duty owing to a third person. Surely the brakeman, whose duty it is in the course of his employment to throw a switch when he sees an on-coming train, would be liable to passengers on the train injured by his failure to do so. As stated in Halsbury, 2nd Ed., Vol. 23, p. 588, the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance has no application to the question of liability when the duty properly to do a particular act omitted or improperly performed has been established. It is well settled that negligence consists in a legal duty to exercise care and a failure in the exercise of the care necessary in the circumstances of any particular case. In my opinion, Nicholas owed a duty to persons in the position of the appellant who were entitled to rely on the proper discharge of that duty in the marking of the dangerous ditch; Howard v. The King 67.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and below, and direct judgment in favour of the appellant Grossman in the amount found by the learned trial judge, namely, $7,003.90.\nThe appeal of Sun should be quashed without costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 68 dismissing the appellants' action for damages arising out of injuries suffered in the course of landing an aeroplane, piloted by the appellant Grossman, at the Saskatoon airport on July 19, 1948.\nThe airport at Saskatoon is owned by His Majesty in the right of the Dominion and operated through the Department of Transport. It is a public airport, within the meaning of the Air Regulations contained in P.C. 2129, dated the 11th day of May, 1948, and passed under the authority of the Aeronautics Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 3). In 1946 contractors completed two large cement runways and, for purposes of drainage, an open ditch upon which Grossman's aeroplane was wrecked. The appellant Grossman is an experienced pilot, licensed by the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the United States Department of Commerce. He owned a 1948 model Stinson Station Wagon in which he had flown into Canada, where he had landed at a few airports, and was at Prince Albert on July 19, 1948, when he and the appellant Sun left for the city of Saskatoon. Grossman had never seen the airport at Saskatoon, but had obtained a map of the Saskatoon-Prince Albert area, upon which it was noted that Saskatoon had a \"public airport with beacon.\" In conversation with some men at the Prince Albert airport Grossman was told that at Saskatoon \"there was a good airport\" with \"two new runways.\" He left Prince Albert with the intention of landing upon one of these new runways.\nGrossman describes July 19, 1948, as \"a beautiful day\" upon which, at about 2:30 in the afternoon, he left Prince Albert. Approximately 15 miles from Saskatoon he commenced to reduce his altitude from about 3,000 to 2,500 feet above ground and, as he came to the airport, he came down to 1,500 feet. Visibility was good and he had no difficulty in locating the airport at Saskatoon.\nHis only effort, through his two-way radio, to communicate with those in charge at the airport failed. He, however, proceeded to effect a landing upon one of the two cement runways, but, in coming down, he observed men working thereon. He thereupon regained altitude to 600 feet and, after making \"a left turn to the east, another turn north, along that east boundary of the field\", he came down on the grass landing strip and, while taxiing toward the hangars, he observed, but too late, the ditch here in question and there damaged his aeroplane.\nThis grass area was regularly used by lighter aeroplanes, such as Grossman's, and it is not suggested that Grossman had not a right to land thereon. It is contended that had he used due care in his attempt to land he would have seen the ditch, or the warning flags, and avoided the injuries suffered.\nThis grass area runs from the north fence southward to near the hangars, a distance of approximately 4,000 feet. Grossman says that, though he observed the length of this distance, he saw neither the ditch nor the flags and, having regard to the position of the hangars, he landed farther south of the fence than the evidence discloses all others landed. He explained that he did so because he would not have so far to taxi. As a consequence, before coming to a stop, he came upon the ditch, where he suffered the damage here claimed.\nThis ditch was constructed as, and was intended to remain, an open ditch. It is 2,000 feet long, 48 feet wide at the top, 7 to 11 feet in depth, and crosses the grass area about 2,800 feet south of the north fence and some 1,300 feet north of the hangars.\nThe construction of the open ditch across the grass runway constituted not only an obstruction within the meaning of the Air Regulations, but \"special circumstances\" which called \"for a prohibition to land liable to be prolonged\" and, therefore, should have been marked by \"a red square panel, placed horizontally, each side of which measures at least 10 feet and the diagonals of which are covered by yellow strips at least 20 inches in width, arranged in the form of an X;\" (The Air Regulations, Part V, para. 13(d) (1)).\nNicholas, the airport maintenance foreman or airport manager, was and had been in charge of this airport since 1945. He occupied that position when this open ditch was constructed and recognized it as an obstruction upon the landing area. As a consequence, he caused flags to be placed upon both sides of this ditch. They were red woollen flags, approximately 24 by 36 inches, and upon wooden poles 10 to 12 feet in height, placed on both sides about 100 feet apart, but so staggered that along the ditch a flag appeared at every 50 feet. This he did to warn aeroplanes approaching the airport and vehicular traffic working thereon. It is not, however, contended that these flags, so placed, constituted a compliance with the foregoing provision, nor, indeed, would they have been sufficient to clearly mark this obstruction within the general provision of Part V, para. 12, of the Air Regulations.\nGrossman's failure to persist in his effort to communicate with those in charge of the airport and his failure to make a dummy run, both of which may be desirable and even necessary in certain circumstances, were not such upon this occasion. It was a clear day, with visibility good, and if this ditch was not apparent there was nothing to suggest any difficulty in the making of a landing. Grossman did not see the flags, as placed, but, had warnings, in compliance with the Air Regulations, surrounded this ditch, there is every reason to conclude that he, making his observations at an altitude of 600 feet, would have seen them. These provisions in the Air Regulations should be regarded as the minimum requirement necessary to provide reasonable warning to pilots as they fly over or across the airport with the intent of effecting a landing. The flags here placed as a warning constituted but a negligent attempt to comply with the regulations and was the direct cause of the damage here claimed.\nIt is, however, contended on behalf of the Crown that, though the negligence of its agents and servants in not providing adequate warnings was the direct cause, the Crown is not liable for the damage suffered by Grossman, notwithstanding the provisions of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act:\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n* * *\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to the property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employement;\nThis provision, in its original form enacted in 1887, effected a change in the common law under which the Crown was not liable for the damage caused by the tortious acts of its agents and servants. After the amendment of 1917, Chief Justice Duff, in The King v. Dubois 69 at 397, interpreted this section, and the subsequent amendment of 1938 does not affect the relevancy of his statement:\nMy view has always been that where you have a public work, in the sense indicated in the course of the preceding discussion, and an injury is caused through the negligence of some servant of the Crown in the execution of his duties or employment in the construction, the repair, the care, the maintenance, the working of such public work, you are not deforming the language of the section, as amended in 1917, by holding that such an injury comes within the scope of the statute; that is to say, that it is an injury due to the negligence of an employee of the Crown while acting in the scope of his duties or employment \"upon a public work.\" I have always thought, moreover, that the principle ought not to be applied in a niggardly way and that it ought to extend to the negligent acts of public servants necessarily or reasonably incidental to the construction, repair, maintenance, care, working of public works. The purpose of this public airport is to provide for the reception and despatch of aeroplanes\u2014not only those operated by the citizens of Canada, but, having regard to the international agreements and conventions to which Canada is a party, also those operated by citizens of other countries. In these circumstances, the maintenance foreman or manager of this airport owed a duty, not only to the Crown, but to those who, as Grossman, properly utilized this airport. This distinguishes the case at bar from The King v. Anthony 70. Unlike the soldier who fired the bullet in that case, the maintenance foreman at this airport was acting within the scope of his employment. Then, unlike the superior officers in the Anthony case, of whom it was said their duties, as fixed by the military law relative to the supervision of their subordinates, were \"not intended to enure to the private benefit of the citizen\" and that such \"an officer is not within the rule of respondeat superior for the act of one within his command,\" the maintenance foreman, in supervising the placing of these flags, was acting within the scope of his employment and performing a duty that, having regard to the permission granted to the public, was intended \"to enure\" to the benefit of those properly using the airport.\nThe contention that under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act the Crown is not liable for nonfeasance on the part of its agents and servants does not arise in this case. The conduct of the maintenance foreman or manager constituted a misfeasance, as that term has been understood and interpreted in this Court. Not only did he supervise the placing of these flags in the first place, but, as he stated, \"they were replaced which was done from time to time, to our best judgment.\" He was maintaining and replacing them, which he negligently believed constituted a sufficient warning, in the course of the performance of his duties at this airport and, as he did so, was \"acting within the scope of his duties or employment\", within the meaning of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nIt is often difficult to determine whether non-action is properly described as nonfeasance or, more appropriately, as an omission in the course of the discharge or execution of a duty or undertaking and, therefore, an improper performance, rather than a mere non-performance. In this case the maintenance foreman has negligently performed his duty to provide adequate warnings within the meaning of the regulations covering this ditch.\nIn The King v. Hochelaga Shipping & Towing Co. Ltd. 71, before a jetty was completed about 50 feet of the upper portion of the outward end broke away during a heavy storm, leaving the lower portion in position, but entirely submerged. The suppliant's towboat struck this submerged portion and the consequent damages were awarded against the Crown. Mr. Justice Crocket, writing the judgment of the majority of the Court, stated, at p. 163 that the collision\nwas attributable to such negligence on the part of officers and servants of the Crown, while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work as rendered the Crown responsible therefor under the provisions of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. It was not a case of mere non-repair or nonfeasance, but of the actual creation of a hidden menace to navigation by a Department of the Government through its fully authorized officers and servants in the construction of a public work.\nChief Justice Duff, at p. 155:\n* * * that the submerged cribwork which, after the superstructure of the jetty had been carried away, was left with nothing to warn navigators of its presence, constituted a dangerous menace to navigation; and that in leaving this obstruction without providing any such warning the officials concerned are chargeable with negligence for which the Crown is responsible by force of section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nMr. Justice Davis, at p. 169:\nWhile in one sense the acts complained of might be regarded as an omission, in substance the result of the acts of those in charge of the work of restoration of the jetty constituted misfeasance.\nThe maintenance foreman regarded this ditch as an obstruction and negligently performed his duty to place markings thereon, within the meaning of the Air Regulations, and thereby permitted this obstruction to remain without any adequate warning of its presence to those using the airport. It was a negligent performance of work undertaken by an agent or servant of the Crown and, as such, constituted misfeasance.\nThough in The King v. Canada Steamship Lines, Limited 72, misfeasance and nonfeasance are not discussed, it is, however, significant to note that Chief Justice Anglin, writing the judgment of the Court, stated:\nIn taking the risk of allowing the continued use of the wharf pending such report and in failing to give any warning to the officers of the steamship company Brunet was in my opinion guilty of a dereliction of duty amounting to negligence on his part as an \"officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work\". (The King v. Schrobounst) 73, and his neglect entailed liability of the Crown for the consequent injuries in person and property sustained by the passengers in attempting to land on the slip on the 7th of July.\nGrossman's appeal should be allowed and judgment directed for $7,003.90, with costs throughout. This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of the appellant Sun, his claim being for $440 only. It should, therefore, be quashed, but without costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Kerwin, subject to one reservation.\nI do not think it necessary to decide in this appeal whether we are bound by the judgment of the majority in The King v. Anthony 74, to hold that in order to create a liability of the Crown under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act it must invariably appear that some servant of the Crown has drawn upon himself a personal liability to the suppliant. I wish to reserve that question for future consideration if and when it may become necessary to determine it. It may then appear that this proposition of law was stated in wider terms than were necessary to the actual decision. It must be remembered that the alleged breach of duty complained of in Anthony's case was the failure of a non-commisioned officer in the military forces to give certain orders to men under his command in the course of manoeuvres being carried out in time of actual war, although not in the face of the enemy. It may well be that under such circumstances the tests of liability differ from those applicable to cases in which the Crown is engaged in carrying on an activity which, if operated by an individual, would be an ordinary commercial undertaking.\nI would dispose of the appeals as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal of appellant Grossman, allowed with costs here and below.

LIMITED OF MONTREAL APPELLANTS\nAND\nACHILLE LALONDE RESPONDENT,\nAND\nALBERT LAMARRE TRUSTEE.\nPRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Fauteux JJ.\nREPORTER'S NOTE:-The appeal was first argued on October 25, 1951. By order of the Court, it was re-argued on March, 1952.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nBankruptcy-Assets not equalling 50 per cent of unsecured claims-Dis\u00adcretion to refuse discharge-Terms--After-acquired salary-Whether non-exempt portion vests in trustee-Whether distinction between salary earned in bankrupt business and elsewhere-Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 11, ss. 23(ii), 142, 143-Article 699 C.P.\nThe trial judge refused the respondent his discharge in bankruptcy on the grounds that the assets did not equal 50 per cent of the claims of the unsecured creditors; that the debtor had failed to pay to the trustee the seizable portion of his after-acquired salary; and the insufficiency of his answers as he gave his evidence. The Court of Appeal for Quebec reversed that judgment and granted him his absolute discharge on the main grounds that his debt position had developed from circumstances for which he could not be held respon\u00adsible and that he did not have to account for salary earned elsewhere than in carrying on the business in which he went bankrupt.\nHeld, that the conduct of the bankrupt, while not sufficient to justify the absolute refusal, did justify his discharge only subject to the imposition of terms.\nParliament, in adopting the language of s. 23(i\u00ee) of the Bankruptcy Act, intended that only such portion of the salary of the debtor as was subject to seizure by legal process under the law of the respective provinces should vest in the trustee. The section discloses a clear intention that the bankrupt should retain those exemptions which the Legislature of the Province in which he resided provided for him. Apart from such exemptions, the section applies to all property subject to execution or seizure including wages or salary which could only be reached by garnishee or attachment procedure.\nThere is nothing in the Bankruptcy Act to support the making of any distinction between a salary earned by the debtor in carrying on the business which was the subject-matter of the bankruptcy and a salary earned elsewhere. The purpose and object of the Bankruptcy Act is to equitably distribute the assets of the debtor and to permit of his rehabilitation as a citizen, unfettered by past debts. The discharge, however, is not a matter of right and the provisions of ss. 142 and 143 of the Act plainly indicate that in certain cases the debtor should suffer a period of probation. The penalty involved in the absolute refusal of discharge ought to be imposed only in cases where the conduct of the debtor has been particularly reprehensible, or in what have been described as extreme cases.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court which had refused the respondent his discharge from bankruptcy.\nJohn L. O'Brien Q.C. and E. E. Saunders for the appel\u00adlant, Industrial Acceptance Corporation. This is a clear case of a judgment based on the facts and on the credibility of the witnesses and should not therefore have been reversed by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge could by virtue of s. 142(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, in his discretion, give various orders, including the refusal of the discharge, its suspension, or the attachment of conditions to the discharge. In re Geller[2].\nThe trial judge had no discretion but to refuse the discharge in view of the failure to deposit part of the salary earned subsequently to the bankruptcy. The Court of Appeal erred in finding that the respondent was not obliged to give to the trustee any of his after-acquired earnings if earned in a different occupation. (Ss. 23, 142, 191 of the Act.).\nUnder s. 142, it is mandatory for the Court to refuse the discharge in all cases where the bankrupt has committed a bankruptcy offence or any offence connected with his bankruptcy. As to the obligation to turn the seizable portion of the debtor's salary over to the trustee: Clarkson v. Tod[3], In re Scherzer [4] and In re Baillargeon[5].\nFailure to deposit was a bankruptcy offence and con-tempt of Court, which made it mandatory on the Court to refuse the discharge. The trent of the authorities is that the deposit must be made even before an order of the Court is made. On the question as to whether, on the Court refusing the discharge on the ground that an offence against the Act has been committed, there should not have been a conviction of that offence by a competent Court, the words in s. 142(2) of the Act appear to be clear. They do not provide that the discharge is to be refused where the bankrupt has been convicted of an offence, but where he has committed an offence. Electric Motor & Machinery v. Bank of Montreal[6]).\nR. Gerard Sampson and Cicely M. Sampson for the appellant, The T. Eaton Company. This appellant adopted the argument of John L. O'Brien Q.C., but added that it was entitled to oppose the discharge of the respond\u00adent notwithstanding that its claim was of an alimentary nature for necessaries of life, and with respect to this appellant's claim, the application for discharge should have been refused and in any event costs should not have been awarded against this appellant. In re Reynolds [7] and Vincent v. Daigneault[8]\nRedmond Quain Q.C. for the respondent. Strictly speak\u00ading, the case of Jackson v. Tod (supra) is only authority for the proposition that some part of the ordinary salary of the bankrupt earned before his discharge, in the same occupation as he was engaged in at the time of his bank\u00adruptcy, is divisible amongst his creditors.\nThe consequences of the bankrupt being guilty of an offence under the old Act are, of course, that he can never get a discharge-or so, at any rate, would seem to be the case. Even if the consequences do not go that far and the cases would seem to indicate that they do, it would be at variance with a practice prevailing in this country and elsewhere to find a person guilty of an offence without a full and thorough trial before a judge and a competent Court.\nThe power of the judge in dealing with an application for discharge is not a discretionary one for, amongst other reasons, the reason that he is obliged to consider the report of the trustee and the resolution of the inspectors and must give them their due weight. If he was in the present case exercising a discretion, he did not exercise it in such a way as to preclude review.\nThe judgment was not one that should be upheld. The Court does not appear under s. 142(1) of the Act to be given the authority to refuse to give a conditional discharge. What it is empowered to do is to refuse to give an absolute discharge. It should be noted that under the new Act, the provision whereby the Court was bound to refuse the discharge has been omitted.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nESTEY, J.:-This is an appeal pursuant to leave granted under s. 174(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 11) from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec[9], reversing the judg\u00adment of the Superior Court and granting to the respondent, Achille Lalonde, his absolute discharge in bankruptcy.\nAchille Lalonde, against whom the receiving order was made, entered into the business of selling automobiles and agricultural implements and operating a garage in the spring of 1947. Approximately two months later he formed Lalonde Motor Sales Limited, which took over the business and assumed the assets and liabilities thereof. Lalonde personally guaranteed the indebtedness of, as well as sub\u00adsequent obligations incurred by, the company. This business, as operated first under his own name and then under that of Lalonde Motor Sales Limited, continued for about eleven months, when a receiving order was made against the company. A few days later T. A. Lalonde presented a petition in bankruptcy dated July 28, 1948, against his son, the respondent in this appeal. The respondent was judged a bankrupt,on the third day of August, 1948, and on July 25, 1949, he requested an appointment for the hearing of his application for a discharge in bankruptcy.\nThe liabilities of Achille Lalonde, as guarantor, approxi\u00admated $90,000, and his other obligations over $1,900, a total indebtedness of about $92,000. His assets realized $22,600, which permitted a payment to the creditors of about 12 cents on the dollar. Mr. Justice Marquis, presiding in the Superior Court, had before him the trustee's report, the minutes of the inspectors' meeting at which that report was considered and the evidence of the respondent-debtor Achille Lalonde. The trustee's report, which under s. 148(8) is prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained, set out that the debtor's guarantee of the debts of Lalonde Motor Sales Limited was the cause of his bankruptcy; a dividend of about 12 per cent would be paid to the unsecured creditors; the conduct of the debtor, both before and after bankruptcy, had not been reprehensible; and that he had not committed an act of bankruptcy. The trustee, however, recommended that the discharge should be refused because\nQue l'actif du d\u00e9biteur n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9gal \u00e0 cinquante pour cent de son passif non garanti.\nMr. Justice Marquis refused the discharge and based his decision largely upon grounds that may be grouped under three headings: that the assets did not equal 50 per cent of the claims of the unsecured creditors; that the debtor had failed to pay to the trustee the seizable, or non-exempt, portion of his salary; and the insufficiency of his answers as he gave his evidence.\nThe learned judges in appeal reversed his judgment, mainly upon a consideration of the first two of these bases. The relevant portions of s. 142 provide that the judge shall refuse or suspend the discharge, or impose a con\u00addition, if, as set out in s. 143(a), the \"assets of the bankrupt ... . are not of a value equal to fifty cents in the dollar on the amount of his unsecured liabilities unless he satisfies the court\" that this low valuation \"has arisen from circum\u00adstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible.\"\nLalonde's personal bankruptcy was due to the failure of Lalonde Motor Sales Limited, a company which he had formed to take over his personal business, which he com\u00adpletely controlled and managed. Such a company has a separate legal existence, but when, as here, the bankruptcy of that company, which he alone had managed, was the cause of his own bankruptcy, it was quite proper that the learned judge should examine Lalonde's conduct of that business in order to determine whether, within the meaning of s. 143(a), his debt position had developed \"from circum\u00adstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible.\" Lalonde estimated the company had done a million dollars' worth of business in eleven months and entertained the opinion that the future was bright. In fact, he says that after he was aware of the indebtedness of the company he tried to continue in the hope that the sales would realize a sufficient profit to permit it to carry on. He deposed that, while the company kept books, there was no record made of his personal drawings, as to the amount of which the only evidence was his own statement that he drew money as he needed it and\nJ'ai essay\u00e9 de vivre comme Ies gens avec qui je transigeais.\nHe did not produce a balance sheet or any records of the company, but was content to state to the court that these were all in the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy of the company and to give evidence of figures based upon his estimates and recollections. Upon these figures the learned trial judge found a sum of $45,000 unaccounted for. The Appellate Court examined the figures and concluded that they had accounted for at least a part thereof. These figures, incomplete and, at most, but approximately accur\u00adate, with great respect, did not provide sufficient proof upon which to found a conclusion that the debtor had made a satisfactory explanation as to why his assets were less than 50 cents on the dollar.\nThe learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, after referring to the fact that the assets did not equal 50 per cent of the unsecured liabilities and to the provisions of s. 143(a), stated:\nATTENDU que par son t\u00e9moignage nullement contredit, le failli \u00e9tablit que si la valeur de son actif n'\u00e9gale pas cinquante cents par dollar de ses obligations non garanties, cela provient de circonstances dont il ne saurait raisonnablement \u00eatre tenu responsable;\nThe debtor, in his pleadings, took the position that if the assets did not equal 50 cents on the dollar that was because\nque ladite liquidation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec les soins voulus.\nAt the hearing before the learned judge he withdrew that allegation.\nAt the hearing he did complain that the Kayser-Fraser Company Limited shipped to him too many automobiles. Here again he merely stated that the company shipped these automobiles without his ordering them, but did not indicate on what basis automobiles were properly shipped to him. His evidence as to this allegation, as well as upon other items, was based upon recollection expressed in most general terms and entirely unsupported by any documents which, if they existed, were available, because, as he deposed, the records of the company were in the possession of the company's trustee. The evidence, however, of the number of automobiles on hand, having regard to the nature and volume of the business, did not support this contention. Moreover, he did not show to what extent that contributed to his bankruptcy which, in view of the company's financing methods, would appear to be import-ant. The same remarks apply to his complaints with respect to the finance company, both in relation to his own and the company's business, and of the Turcotte Company.\nThe learned judges in the Appellate Court commented upon the fact that the sale of the Val d'Or property was, upon the evidence, in the best interests of the estate. It would rather appear that the learned judge of the first instance was not making a finding as to the merits of the sale. He did comment upon the fact that the purchase price of $20,200 was less than the municipal valuation of $27,500, but it was Lalonde's attitude, as he gave his evidence, his professed ignorance as to details thereof, and particularly that he did not know his brother-in-law had purchased it, that impressed the learned trial judge and undoubtedly influenced him, along with the other facts, in his estimation of Lalonde.\nThroughout his evidence Lalonde's statements are so vague and general in character that a reading thereof justifies agreement with the learned judge, who had the added advantage of observing him as he gave his evidence, when he stated:\nCONSIDERANT que les d\u00e9clarations du failli devant la Cour, lors de l'enqu\u00eate sur la pr\u00e9sente demande, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 notre point de vue suffisantes pour justifier sa demande;\nThe learned judge was evidently of the opinion that Lalonde, upon his own evidence, had not satisfied the onus placed upon him by s. 143(a) to establish that though the assets were less than 50 cents upon the dollar it was due to circumstances for which he could not justly be held responsible. The learned judge also commented upon Lalonde's failure to pay, as requested, the seizable portion of his salary to the trustee.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal commented upon the debtor's failure to pay the salary as follows:\nATTENDU qu'il est vrai que le failli n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucun produit de son salaire chez le syndic avant qu'une demande ne lui en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite; que l'article 143 qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les faits qui peuvent \u00eatre un motif de refus de lib\u00e9ration, ne fait nullement une obligation au failli de rendre compte du salaire qu'il gagne, hors les op\u00e9rations du commerce qui sont la cause de sa faillite;\nLalonde, after becoming bankrupt, was employed by The Sherwin-Williams Co. of Canada Limited at a salary of $390 per month. On April 25, 1949, the trustee verbally and in writing requested Lalonde to deposit the seizable portion of his salary with him. The trustee based his request upon the view that all of the salary vested in him except that which was exempt under s. 23(i\u00ee), where the provincial laws with respect to exemptions are adopted. The exemptions provided to those in the Province of Quebec earning salaries or wages are provided for in Article 599(11) of the Civil Code of Procedure. There it is provided that one who is earning a salary in excess of $6.00 per day is entitled to two-thirds thereof by way of an exemption. Upon a date that the evidence does not fix accurately, but in the summer months, Lalonde left the employment of The Sherwin-Williams Co. of Canada Limited and accepted employment with his father at a salary of $50 per week. He was, therefore, earning more than $6.00 per day with both employers and, within the meaning of Article 599 of the Civil Code of Procedure, in the trustee's view, one-third of the salary, as earned, vested in him. Lalonde paid to the trustee $175, whereas he should have paid $1,800.\nThe attention of the learned judges was not directed to the decision in Re Tod [10], where this Court held that the salary of a debtor in bankruptcy, earned subsequently to his being adjudged bankrupt, vested in the trustee, subject to the court fixing an alimentary allowance.\nS. 23 of the Canadian act is based upon s. 15 of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869 (32 & 33 Viet., c. 71) and now contained in s. 38 of An Act to Consolidate the Law Relating to Bankruptcy (1914, 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 59). There are, however, important differences. In particular, s. 38(2) of the English act reads:\n38. The property of the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors, ... . shall not comprise the following particulars:\u2011\n(2) The tools (if any) of his trade and the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself, his wife and children, to a value, inclusive of tools and apparel and bedding, not exceeding twenty pounds in the whole :\nThe corresponding s. 23(ii) of the Canadian Act reads:\n23. Les biens du d\u00e9biteur, susceptibles d'\u00eatre partag\u00e9s entre ses cr\u00e9anciers ... . ne doivent pas comprendre ce qui suit:\n(ii) Les biens qui, au pr\u00e9judice du d\u00e9biteur, sont exempts d'ex\u00e9cution ou de saisie selon la proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, conform\u00e9ment aux lois de la province dans laquelle sont situ\u00e9s les biens ou dans laquelle est domicili\u00e9 le d\u00e9biteur.\nS. 2(f) defines \"property\" as follows:\n\"biens\" comprend les deniers, marchandises, choses en action, ... .\nMr. Justice Smith, in writing the judgment of In re Tod, supra, stated at p. 241:\nThe English decisions referred to above seem to establish beyond any question that, by the language of the English Act, \"all such property as ... may be acquired by or devolve on him before his discharge,\" the instalments of salary such as are in question here vest in and belong to the trustee as they fall due, subject to the alimentary provisions referred to.\nThis precise language is adopted in the Canadian Act and is not capable of any difference of meaning in Canada from its meaning in England.\nIt would appear that Parliament, in adopting the language of s. 23(i\u00ee) (particularly when compared with the language of s. 38(2) in the English act) intended that only such portion of the salary as was subject to seizure by legal process under the law of the respective provinces should vest in the trustee. Moreover, the omission .of any such provision as that contained in s. 51(2) of the English act, under which, on the application of the trustee, an order might be made against a bankrupt in receipt of a salary to pay the whole or part thereof to the trustee, appears to support the foregoing view.\nNeither the provisions of s. 23 nor of any other section of the act appear to support, with great respect, the dis\u00adtinction suggested by the learned judges in the Appellate Court between a salary earned in carrying on the business the subject matter of the bankruptcy and that earned elsewhere.\nIt follows the trustee was within his rights when he requested Lalonde to pay to him the seizable or non-exempt portion of his salary and it was the duty of the debtor to pay over such salary to him. The record discloses that in response to the trustee's request he did pay the sum of $175, but he made no explanation to the trustee of his failure to pay a further sum in excess of $1,600 and at the hearing he made no other suggestion than that it was due to illness, in respect of which neither its character nor duration was specified, nor, indeed, the time of its occur\u00adrence.. The learned judge, however, did not consider whether his failure constituted an offence under s. 191(b) of the Bankruptcy Act. He was nevertheless justified, where, as here, no satisfactory explanation was made as to his failure, in taking into consideration his conduct in relation to his non-payment of the required portion of his salary in the exercise of his judicial discretion to refuse, suspend or direct the discharge, subject to a condition.\nMr. Quain, on behalf of Lalonde, contended that s. 23(i\u00ee) applied only to property subject to seizure under execution and that the phrase in s. 23(ii) \"execution or seizure under legal process\" did not apply to wages or salary which could only be reached by a garnishee or attachment procedure. His contention was that this is the effect of Re Tod, supra. The application in that case was made by the trustee asking the court to direct that a bankrupt, earning a salary of $10,000 a year, should pay all in excess of $100 per week to the trustee. The decision is based largely upon Hamilton v. Caldwell[11]), with regard to which Mr. Justice Smith, writing the judgment of this Court in Re Tod, stated at p. 242:\nThe decision is that it is competent to the court to make such an order and this decision is arrived at on the general principles of equity and not by virtue of any special provisions in the Scottish act.\nHamilton v. Caldwell was a decision of the House of Lords under the Scottish act in which, as in Canada, there is no section corresponding to s. 51(2) of the English act.\nThe Bankruptcy Court in Re Tod, supra, exercised its power to fix an alimentary allowance which, under the Canadian act, might be more than but not less than the exemption provided to the bankrupt by s. 23(ii). The relevant exemption law in Ontario was The Wages Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 176). S. 7 thereof provided to the debtor an exemption of 70 per cent of his salary, with power in a court to reduce that percentage. The court in Re Tod acted within the scope of that enactment. The application considered (in Re Tod, supra) was quite different from that here under consideration and the language used must be read and construed in relation to the issues raised.\nIt would appear that when the Parliament of Canada saw fit to omit s. 51(2) of the English act and to entirely rewrite s. 23(ii), being the corresponding section in the Canadian act, it disclosed a clear intention that s. 23(ii) should retain to the bankrupt those exemptions which the Legislature of the province in which he resided provided for him. The language in s. 23(i\u00ee), as expressed in French:\net tous les biens qui peuvent \u00eatre acquis par lui ou qui peuvent lui \u00eatre d\u00e9volus avant sa lib\u00e9ration;\nand as in English:\nand all property which may be acquired by or devolve on him before his discharge; is sufficiently comprehensive to include a procedure by way of garnishment or attachment of salary or wages. In the Province of Quebec the exemptions where salary or wages are garnisheed or attached are fixed, as already stated, by Article 599(11) of the Civil Code of Procedure.\nIt is not submitted that the learned judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion contemplated by s. 142, over-looked any fact. The learned judges in the Appellate Court did not agree with certain of his conclusions, as already discussed. Moreover, the learned judges appear, in addition to the items already considered, to have been influenced by the fact that the creditors had not adduced evidence in support of their respective allegations. No witnesses were called by the creditors, but they had a right to submit their contentions upon the evidence adduced before the learned judge. Upon the evidence before him the learned judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, concluded that Lalonde was not entitled to his discharge.\nA judgment rendered in the exercise of a judicial dis\u00adcretion under s. 142 ought not to be disturbed by an appellate court, unless the learned judge, in arriving at his conclusion, has omitted the consideration of or misconstrued some fact, or violated some principle of law. In re Richards[12]; In re Wood[13]; In re Labrosse[14]; In re Lobel[15]; Re Smith [16]. A consideration of the whole of the evidence, with great respect, does not warrant a reversal of the judgment of the learned judge of the first instance.\nAppellate courts, however, where they have concluded that the discretionary judgment of the judge of the first instance ought not to be disturbed, have repeatedly relieved against what has appeared to them to be an undue severity in the terms imposed. Re Nicholas[17] ; Re Swabey[18] ; Re Thiessen [19]. The purpose and object of the Bank\u00adruptcy Act is to equitably distribute the assets of the debtor and to permit of his rehabilitation as a citizen, unfettered by past debts. The discharge, however, is not a matter of right and the provisions of ss. 142 and 143 plainly indicate that in certain cases the debtor should suffer a period of probation. The penalty involved in the absolute refusal of discharge ought to be imposed only in cases where the conduct of the debtor has been particularly reprehensible, or in what have been described as extreme cases. The conduct of the debtor in this case, while not sufficient, with great respect, to justify the absolute refusal, does justify his discharge only subject to the imposition of terms.\nThe usual practice would suggest a reference of this matter back to the judge of first instance. There are, how-ever, here present reasons, including the fact that the assets are not large, which, in the interests of the debtor and the creditors, justify a present final disposition and the avoidance of the expense incident to further proceedings. The claim of the appellant, The T. Eaton Co. Limited, is for necessaries and, therefore, an alimentary debt as defined in s. 2(b). Section 147 provides:\n147. An order of discharge shall not release the bankrupt or authorized assignor.\n* * *\n(d) from any debt or liability for necessaries of life, and the court may make such order for payment thereof as it deems just or expedient.\nUnder the terms of this provision we direct that the debtor make payment forthwith ,of the claim for the necessaries of life by The T. Eaton Co. Limited in the sum of $92.60.\nWe further direct that under the provisions of s. 142(2) (d) the debtor, as a condition of his discharge, shall consent to a judgment against him by the trustee for a part of the balance of the debts proved in these proceedings in the sum of $5,000 and that the said sum of $5,000 shall be paid: $1,500 on June 30, 1953; $1,500 on June 30, 1954; and $2,000 on June 30, 1955.\nThe Court appreciates the exhaustive presentation by counsel of their respective submissions and is particularly grateful to Mr. Quain, who undertook the presentation of the debtor's case at its request.\nThe appellants, Industrial Acceptance Corporation and T. Eaton Co. Ltd. of Montreal, will have their costs in this Court and in the Courts below, payable to them out of the estate. The respondent, Lalonde, will have costs in this 'Court only, payable out .of the estate.\nSolicitors for Industrial Acceptance Corporation: O'Brien, Stewart, Hale & Nolan.\nSolicitor for The T.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMcleod Engines Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: February 7, 8, 11, 12; 1952: May 12.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Commercial\u2014Agreement to supply engines to complete orders\u2014Whether letters of request for engines were orders\u2014Claim for rectification\u2014\"Orders\"\u2014Admissibility of oral evidence.\nThe appellant and the respondent were agents for the sale of Chrysler marine engines in British Columbia. On January 26, 1949, the respondent agreed to surrender its franchise and to sell its stock of engines and accessories to the appellant; it was also agreed that the appellant would supply the respondent \"with the necessary Chrysler engines to complete the orders shown on the attached list\". No such list was attached to the agreement. The parties met again the following day, and the respondent, after showing some of its import permits, wrote to the appellant: \"As agreed in our meeting yesterday, we are listing below orders we have on hand\u2026\" This list was compiled from letters from fishing companies, dated in 1948, and setting out an estimate of the number of engines they would need for the 1949 season and expressing the hope that the respondent would be able to deliver them as and when required. The particulars of equipment and accessories were not set out in the letters. With these letters, the respondent was able to obtain the necessary import permits to bring the engines in from the United States.\nAfter supplying some engines, the appellant refused any further delivery unless the respondent produced firm written orders obtained on or prior to January 26, 1949. In an action for breach of contract, the appellant pleaded, inter alia, that it had agreed to supply the engines to enable the respondent to fulfil only bona fide orders, and counter-claimed for rectification of the contract. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondent that there had been no discussion as to the type of orders, and accordingly there could be no rectification and found that the appellant had in no way been deceived by the respondent. This judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting), that since the letters were not orders within the meaning of that expression as used in the agreement no breach had been shown, and therefore the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nPer Estey J.: The evidence adduced supports the contention that a latent ambiguity was raised that justified the examination of the surrounding circumstances to determine the intent and meaning of the word \"orders\" as used in the contract. But this, however, did not permit the reception in evidence of declarations from representatives of the customers, setting forth their intention with respect to the meaning and purport of these letters. That intention, as in written instruments generally, must be determined by the court upon a construction of the language adopted by the parties to express their intention. The letters were estimates of customers' requirements and not orders for engines to be delivered in the future. If the respondent intended them as orders, it should have disclosed it, or made their contents known to the appellant in such manner that it would have understood respondent's meaning and intention.\nPer Locke J.: The documents upon which the respondent must rely as constituting orders are the letters from certain customers prior to the agreement; and the word \"orders\" in the agreement cannot be construed as including these letters. The respondent's pleadings do not assert that by custom in the trade or otherwise the word \"orders\" should be construed otherwise than in accordance with its commonly accepted meaning, namely, a direction to make, provide or furnish anything at the responsibility of the person ordering. Oral evidence of those customers as to what they intended to convey by their letters was inadmissible; in the absence of any ambiguity in the language employed and in the state of the pleadings, the question of interpretation was for the trial judge. The letters were by their very terms simply estimates of the requirements of the companies during the coming season and not a direction or request to supply goods or an offer capable of acceptance.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): In view of the impossibility of rescission and the completely executed consideration, the only issues open would be fraud and warranty. The former has been disposed of by the vindication of the respondent; the latter must arise as a conclusion of intention to be drawn by the court from the letters, but there is nothing in them that would justify that. There was no reason to affirm when there was no question of what was in mind or of any undisclosed matter. The appellant was willing to supply those engines, and the technical difference between orders and what the letters involved was not of such a nature as would deprive the appellant of something of which it sought assurance. Furthermore, the word \"orders\" as used embraces the commercial commitments contained in the lettears.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], Smith J.A. dissenting, affirming the judgment of the trial judge awarding the respondent damages for breach of contract.\nAlfred Bull Q.C. for the appellant. The real issue is whether the respondent had on hand the orders which it stated it had; and whether these letters were orders or just letters non-enforceable as contracts. It was intended by both parties that the appellant would supply engines to the respondent to fulfil existing enforceable orders which the respondent had acquired or sales it had made prior to January 26, 1949. The evidence discloses that the documents which purportedly created the contract relationship between the respondent and the fishing companies were in reality only estimates of the possible future requirements of these companies. This material was supplied to the respondent upon his solicitation for the sole purpose of enabling the respondent to acquire stock against which the companies could order in the future.\nThere is no plea of any custom of the trade that was in the contemplation of the parties to the effect that orders would be taken to mean anything but the ordinary meaning of the word, viz., an unqualified offer to purchase.\nThe evidence as to the meaning of that word was not admissible since the word is not ambiguous.\nIf the parties were not ad idem, then there was no contract.\nAs to the cross-appeal, there was no evidence to support the claim on the accessories. There was no contempiation by the parties that the loss of profit was contemplated in the event of a breach of the contract. The second rule in Hadley v. Baxendale [2] is applicable to this case.\nW. S. Owen Q.C. and F. Bonnell for the respondent. The letters of essentiality were in fact orders requiring the respondent to acquire the engines for future delivery. Hammond v. Bussey[3].\nThe appellant did not contemplate that the list should contain sufficient description to identify each individual engine. Hillas & Co. v. Arcos Ltd. [4], Northern Ontario Power Co. v. Lake Shore Mines [5] and Cotter v. General Petroleums [6].\nThe appellant's representatives were well aware of the import restrictions and that a considerable delay would elapse between the time the applications were filed and the permits granted, and that it would be impossible to specify the particulars of each engine required for future delivery. Scammell and Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston [7] and Hillas case (supra). The appellant is not entitled to rectification as the agreement accurately sets out the intention of the parties and the real agreement between them.\nThe appellant is not entitled to rescission of the agreement as no misrepresentation of any kind was at any time made by the respondent; and in any event the contract cannot be rescinded after the position of the parties has changed so that the former state of things cannot be restored.\nAs to the admissibility of the evidence, the case of Birrell v. Dryer [8] is relied on.\nIf the parties were not at idem, then there would be no contract but there is a finding by the trial judge that the appellant knew the system followed by the respondent. The appellant had opportunities to clear up the matter if he was not satisfied.\nOn the cross-appeal, the respondent relies on both rules in Hadley v. Baxendale [9].\nKERWIN J.:\u2014I agree with my brothers Estey and Locke. The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout to the appellant. The cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe dissenting judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014This controversy is over the terms of an agreement involving the termination of an agency held by the respondents, McLeod Limited, for the sale, in Victoria, British Columbia, of marine engines manufactured by the Chrysler Corporation of the United States. The appellants, Atlas Company, held a like agency for Vancouver and as Chrysler seemed disposed to extend the district of Atlas to include that of McLeod, the latter, who had exercised the agency for about two years against Atlas' fourteen or more, decided to surrender on the best terms obtainable. The parties, including a representative of Chrysler met first in Seattle, later in Vancouver and finally in Victoria, and their agreement is to be deduced from letters to which reference will now be made. The first communication is from Atlas to McLeod at Vancouver, on January 26, 1949, and the material portions are:\u2014\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. of Vancouver, B.C., agrees to buy from McLeod Engines Ltd., all their stock of Chryaler marine engines, Chrysler marine parts, and marine accessories; also one Dodge service truck.\n***\nIt is further agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will supply to McLeod Engines Limited the parts necessary to complete engines now being overhauled at Begg Brothers Limited. These parts to be supplied at cost.\nIt is further agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will supply McLeod Engines Limited with the necessary Chrysler engines to complete the orders shown on the attached sheet.\nAll merchandise purchased will be first-class condition and at actual cost.\nThe above is agreed to when mutual termination of Chrysler marine franchise in the Province of British Columbia is negotiated.\nThe second, from McLeod to Atlas, dated, at Victoria, on January 27, reads:\u2014\nAs agreed in our meeting yesterday, we are listing below orders we have on hand, and in the other column, number of engines that have been delivered against these orders. You will see the orders number one hundred and twenty-four and the deliveries fifty, which will leave us seventy-four to be delivered.\nand is followed by an enumeration of ten fishing companies showing a total of 124 engines ordered and fifty delivered.\nThe last is dated January 31 at Victoria from Cunnings on behalf of Atlas to Alger, Sales Manager of Atlas, with a copy to McLeod:\u2014\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engines Limited has agreed to supply engines to the above company to make deliveries on the list of sales now in our hands at our actual cost, plus $30 to cover our cost of handling. All engines are to be started in our shop to insure engines being in proper mechanical condition at time of delivery.\nMcLeod Engines Limited will issue purchase request with shipping instructions for each engine, and will also issue payment for same direct to Canadian Atlas Diesel Engines Limited.\nThe matter of fishermen's rebate will be worked out between Mr. Evans and McLeod Engines Limited.\nAs is seen, the first letter speaks of \"the orders\" shown on the attached sheet\"; the same word \"orders\" is used in the letter of January 27; and that of January 31 refers to \"the list of sales now in our hands.\" It appears that on April 16, 1948 regulations had been passed by the Dominion Government under c. 7 of the Statutes of Canada, 1948, dealing with exchange controls between Canada and the United States, imposing restrictions on the importation of goods from that country. To enable these engines to be brought into Canada, it was necessary to satisfy the department that there was a commercial need for them here. This led to the requirement of evidence of \"essentiality\" before import permits would be issued.\nIn accordance with this requirement, McLeod in the autumn of 1948 obtained letters from customers estimating their needs for the fishing season of 1949, and intimating that it would ,be expected and certainly desirable that the engines should be available for delivery when wanted. Decision on the applications was said to have taken up about two months and the certificates were received by McLeod either toward the end of the year or early in January, 1949.\nA representative letter of \"essentiality\" is that from Canadian Fishing Companies Limited to McLeod dated October 7, 1948:\u2014\nAfter a careful review of our probable engine requirements over the next several months, we estimate that we will need approximately twenty Chrysler Crown and Chrysler Ace Engines, with 2 1\/2 to 1 reduction gears.\nThe above engines are to be used as power plants for commercial fishing vessels, used exclusively in the commercial fisheries of British Columbia.\nWe sincerely trust that you will be able to make delivery of these engines when required. Thanking you,\nAs these letters were solicited by McLeod, they have a general uniform tenor and phraseology, but they were solicited in the regular course of McLeod's business and before any question of the cancellation of the agency arose.\nThe ground of Mr. Bull's argument is precise and narrow: these letters are not \"orders\" within the meaning of the word: the obligation is to supply engines only in fulfilment of genuine \"orders\"; and Atlas were justified in refusing to meet requests of McLeod for delivery. The question is whether that contention is valid.\nIt should first be made clear that there was no intention on the part of McLeod to misrepresent; they have been acquitted of acting otherwise than in good faith. They must then be taken as believing that what had been received from the companies established a relation embraced within the meaning of the word \"orders\" as used in the correspondence quoted.\nThe originals of the letters had been sent to Ottawa and kept there, and copies had not been retained. When consequently at the meeting in Victoria inquiries were made about them all that could be produced were the permits for importation, of which the following is a sample:\nTO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE, EMERGENCY IMPORT CONTROL BRANCH\nAPPLICATION TO IMPORT CAPITAL GOODS\nINSTRUCTIONS ON THE BACK MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED.\nApplicant's Name\u2014McLeod Engines Limited\nAddress\u20141221 Wharf St., Victoria, B.C.\nDate\u2014October 18, 1948.\nThe undersigned hereby makes application for a permit to import the goods, articles or commodities described hereunder, in respect of which the information furnished herein is certified to be true and correct.\nNo. of Pkgs.\nQuantity\nDescription of Goods\nValue in Canadian Dollars\n15\n15\nChrysler Crown Marine Engines\n$10,500.00\n15\n15\nChrysler Ace Marine Engines\n9,900.00\n$20,400.00\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTo be observed in the Preparation and Completion of an Application for Permit to Import.\n3. Applications can be considered only when:\u2014\n(b) this application is accompanied by a separate declaration of essentiality. This declaration must provide details as in (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) below and be signed by the end user of the goods or a senior member of his organization.\n(i) why purchase cannot be deferred until the current foreign\nexchange situation is corrected; and\n(ii) why the importation is absolutely essential, giving full reasons with supporting evidence; and\n(iii) what steps have been taken to obtain the items from Canadian production sources; and\n(iv) could the equipment be imported for temporary use and returned. Atlas deny knowledge of the practice in obtaining permits as they had been granted a quota of importation against which, however, their imports would be charged unless they could procure an exemption by showing that an imported machine was to be used for essential purposes. This would be to furnish the same justification as for a permit to import.\nThe trial court held that the contract binds Atlas to supply the 74 engines specified in the list as stated in the letter of January 31, and I agree that it does so. On that footing, and assuming Mr. Bull's contention to be well founded, it can be said to have been made, on the part of McLeod, under a mistaken notion that the letters of essentiality were within the word \"orders\"; and on the part of Atlas to have been induced by the misrepresentation of McLeod as to their nature. In view of the impossibility of rescission and the completely executed consideration moving from McLeod, however, the only issues now open would be fraud and warranty. The former has been disposed of by the vindication of McLeod; the latter must arise as a conclusion of intention to be drawn by the Court from the letters, but I see nothing in them, read in the light of the circumstances, that would justify that. There was no reason to affirm when there was no question of what was in mind or of any undisclosed matter. Atlas was willing to supply 74 engines, and the technical difference between orders and what the letters involved was not of such a nature as would deprive Atlas of something of which it sought assurance.\nThat would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal; but as I have come to the conclusion that the word \"orders\" as used embraces the commercial commitments contained in the letters, I think it desirable to base myself on that ground as well as on the former.\nStrictly speaking, an order, in law, is a proposal in the nature of an offer which invites, without more, some form of acceptance intended to lead to an obligation; that acceptance, according to the nature of the order, may be by promise or by some act as, say, the delivery of goods to a carrier. The letters of essentiality here do not go to that length; they do not of themselves alone contemplate an acceptance; but they are bona fide estimates of an approaching season's requirements by a customer to a seller which look to subsequent directions for shipment of the goods mentioned. They imply an assurance that such directions will be given, and exhibit that assurance as a representation to the department of government concerned. They did not, from that moment, in a legal sense, bind the companies, but neither would they had they been orders in the strict sense; before acceptance, an order can be revoked and an outstanding revocable order would admittedly satisfy the language used.\nCould Atlas have believed that that considerable share of the business in such engines for the approaching season would have been specified otherwise than by such an estimate so far in advance, particularly when there had been placed before them and perused all of the importation permits but one which, as explained to them, was at the customs office? Proctor of Chrysler who inspected the permits with Cunnings of Atlas was familiar with the regulations and the necessity for the letters; in the whole of the negotiations, he played a leading part in relation to all terms of the contract, on behalf of Atlas as well as Chrysler, and his knowledge must be imputed to Atlas. That is particularly so in relation to the permits, since Cunnings, at the time, in the presence of Proctor, stated his lack of familiarity with the import procedure and the discussion of this feature proceeded on the basis of Proctor's acquaintance with it. In November, 1948, Proctor had visited McLeod in Vancouver and in the words of F.B. McLeod, \"approved of the orders we had taken.\" Atlas, in co-operation with Chrysler, were in effect driving McLeod out of the market; with the list before them they were willing, so far as numbers went, that the requirements of McLeod's customers for the coming season be fulfilled by that company. It could not but have been seen that the latter had obtained some form of assurance from their customers covering the season's supply. A commercial obligation equal to a revocable order was represented: did that in fact exist? Undoubtedly it did. In the ordinary course of business there would be no less dependability supporting the representation of the letters than an order; they were in effect commercial orders as distinguished from legal orders, behind both of which, until an obligation is created, stands the integrity of commercial commitments.\nWhat, then, in all the circumstances did the understanding at Victoria on this feature come to? Atlas and Proctor were well acquainted with the business of the British Columbia coastal fisheries. They knew that the list which they received gave directly not the then outstanding orders but rather the total orders and the number up to that time filled; and they knew that the totals shown represented the season's requirements of the companies named. Atlas clearly meant to stop short of disrupting business relations established by McLeod. The permits satisfied them of the good faith of McLeod and of the existing commitments, and it was not until around the 20th of March following that any demand for evidence of original \"orders\" was called for.\nFor these reasons, I must reject Mr. Bull's contention. Commercial words, in any context, must take their meaning from the body of circumstances to which they are related and out of which they arise; and although the golden rule is that, subject to well known qualifications, the ordinary and grammatical meaning of language used is to be taken as intended, nevertheless in the use of such a term as that here in question, a sufficiency of significant surrounding facts may, by showing the perspective in which the matters were viewed and what matters of fact were actually in the minds of the parties, extend or modify its scope.\nAs Lord Wright, in Hillas & Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Limited [10], expressed it:\u2014\nThis (i.e., the true construction of a document) is a question of law on which evidence is not relevant, except to the extent clearly stated by Lord Dunedin in Charrington and Co. Limited v. Wooder (110 L.T. Rep. 548, at p. 511; (1914) A.C. 71, at p. 82), where the words \"fair market price\" were to be construed:\n\"Now, in order to construe a contract the court is always entitled to be so far instructed by evidence as to be able to place itself in thought in the same position as the parties to the contract were placed, in fact when they made it, or, as it is sometimes phrased, to be informed as to the surrounding circumstances. As Lord Davey says in the case of Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson, (82 L.T. Rep. 102, at p. 104; (1900) A.C. 182, at p. 188), quoting from a decision of Lord Blackburn's: \"The general rule seems to be that all facts are admissible (to proof) which tend to show the sense the words bear with reference to the surrounding circumstances of and concerning which the words were used.\"\nand Lord Tomlin at p. 511:\u2014\ncommercial documents prepared by business men in connection with dealings in a trade with the workings of which the framers are familiar often by reason of their inartificial forms confront the lawyer with delicate problems.\nThe governing principles of construction recognized by the law are applicable to every document, and yet none would gainsay that the effect of their application is to some extent governed by the nature of the document.\nOn the one hand the conveyance of real estate presenting an artificial form grown up through the centuries and embodying terms of art whose meanings and effect have long since been determined by the courts, and on the other hand the formless document, the product of the minds of men seeking to record a complex trade bargain intended to be carried out, both fall to be construed by the same legal principles, and the problem for a court of construction must always be so to balance matters, that without violation of essential principle the dealings of men may as far as possible be treated as effective, and that the law may not incur the reproach of being the destroyer of bargains.\nThe contract must be construed as a whole: and an undue emphasis upon a word or a phrase may easily distort that balanced understanding which can be seen to have been the crystallized consensus. The expression \"the list of sales now in our hands\" indicates the generality of the notion of Cunnings and emphasizes the fact that these business men had in mind the substance of business relations, not the precision of language.\nMcLeod had been very successful as agents and as late as December Proctor had told them it looked as if they would be given the agency for the province. In that situation, with the knowledge of Proctor of the letters as \"orders,\" Atlas cannot now be heard to say that the contract means such items only as may be \"orders\" as they understand the word. Their intention, in introducing this element of fairness into the proceedings, was to leave intact the body of business McLeod had actually negotiated for the season: and the word as used was intended to describe that. On the cross-appeal I am unable to find in the record sufficient evidence to support the claim for damages for loss of profits on the prospective sales of accessories, as pleaded, and I am in agreement with the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal on this branch of the matter also.\nFor these reasons the appeal and. the cross-appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nESTEY, J.:\u2014 The issues in this appeal are largely determined by the construction of the word \"orders\" in the contract made between the parties hereto dated January 26, 1949. The respondent would, but the appellant would not, give to this word a construction sufficiently comprehensive to include the letters styled letters of essentiality obtained by the respondent from its customers. The learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal[11], Mr. Justice Sydney Smith dissenting, have found in the respondent's favour.\nThe relevant portions of the contract read as follows:\nHOTEL VANCOUVER\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 26th, 1949.\nMcLeod Engines Limited,\n1221 Wharf Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\nGentlemen;\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. of Vancouver, B.C., agrees to buy from McLeod Engines Ltd., all their stock of Chrysler marine engines, Chrysler marine parts, and marine accessories; also one Dodge service truck.\nIt is further agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will supply McLeod Engines Limited with the necessary Chrysler engines to complete the orders shown on the attached sheet.\nThe above is agreed to when mutual termination of Chrysler marine franchise in the Province of British Columbia is negotiated.\nYours very truly,\nCANADIAN ATLAS DIESEL ENGINE CO.

Cunnings\"\nFBM\/ea\nThe terms of this contract, other than that providing for the delivery of the engines as set out in the second of the above-quoted paragraphs, have been performed.\nThe parties hereto, prior to January 26, 1949, under contracts with the Chrysler Corporation of Detroit, Mich., sold marine engines and accessories in separately defined areas in British Columbia. These Chrysler engines had to be imported from the United States. Parliament, in 1948, enacted the Emergency Exchange Conservation Act (S. of C. 1948, c. 7) and under the provisions thereof the Governor General in Council passed regulations and thereafter these engines could only be imported upon compliance therewith. This act and the regulations thereunder came into force on April 22, 1948.\nThe respondent, in order to comply with the foregoing regulations and have engines available as and when its customers might require them, interviewed and obtained from them, in the fall of 1948, letters that in these proceedings have been styled letters of essentiality. These letters it forwarded to Ottawa, together with such orders as it had on hand, in support of its application for importation permits, and when these were received it imported the engines. The original letters of essentiality were retained at Ottawa. They are similar in phraseology and, while copies of five were placed in evidence, that of October 7, 1948, from The Canadian Fishing Company Ltd., is typical:\nDear Sirs:\nAfter a careful review of our probable engine requirements over the next several months, we estimate that we will need approximately twenty Chrysler Crown and Chrysler Ace Engines, with 2 1\/2 to reduction gears.\nThe above engines are to be used as power plants for commercial fishing vessels, used exclusively in the commercial fisheries of British Columbia.\nWe sincerely trust that you will be able to make delivery of these engines when required. Thanking you,\nThe respondent's customers, in these letters, appear to do no more than to estimate their engine requirements in fishing operations, in order that they may assist the respondent in importing the engines and having them on hand as and when they might require them. The language contained in the letter from the British Columbia Packers Ltd. makes this particularly clear, as it states: \"We hope this letter will assist you in being able to have engines available for our requirements.\" The respondent, however, contends that even if these letters be unambiguous upon their face that, having regard to the existence of the regulations, the knowledge thereof by the respective parties, the conversations at Victoria on January 27, the contents of the appellant's letter of instructions dated January 31 and the delivery of 14 engines upon the requisitions specified in that letter, a latent ambiguity is raised that justifies the examination of the surrounding circumstances to determine the intent and meaning of the word \"orders\" as used by the parties in this contract. The evidence adduced supports this contention.\nIn Frenkel v. Mac Andrews & Co[12], where the court construed the word \"route,\" Lord Warrington of Clyffe, at p. 567, said:\nIt is well settled that if the surrounding circumstances raise a latent ambiguity in any of the expressions used, parol evidence may be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining which of the meanings of an ambiguous expression was contemplated by the parties\u2026\nSee also Charrington & Co., Limited v. Wooder [13] and Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson[14].\nThis, however, does not permit the reception in evidence, as at the trial hereof, of declarations from representatives of the customers, setting forth their intention with respect to the meaning and purport of these letters. That intention, as in written instruments generally, must be determined by the court upon a construction of the language adopted by the parties to express their intention. National Bank of Australasia, Limited v. J. Falkingham & Sons[15].\nThe negotiations commenced in Seattle on January 24, 1949, between Proctor of the Chrysler Corporation, Cunnings of the appellant and McLeod and Bramston of the respondent. Proctor informed McLeod that his corporation was enlarging the area of the appellant's franchise in British Columbia. This, as realized by all parties, adversely affected the respondent's position as vendor of Chrysler engines. Certain alternatives were discussed, but no agreement was arrived at when, on the evening of the 25, the parties motored to Vancouver. There, the next day, an agreement was concluded and its terms embodied in the letter of January 26, 1949, to which the attached list was appended, at Victoria, on the following day.\nThe learned trial judge, wherever there was a conflict, accepted the evidence of McLeod and Bramston, as against that of the appellant's witnesses. He, however, did not have an opportunity to observe the demeanour of Proctor, whose evidence was taken upon commission in California.\nThroughout the negotiations and in the contract both parties apparently used the word \"orders\" in the ordinary accepted sense of a request from customers for delivery of engines. McLeod made this clear when he stated in the attached sheet: \"we are listing below orders we have on hand.\" He also deposed to the same effect when he stated that he had the engines \"sold\" by virtue of these letters. McLeod does not dispute this. In fact he does not contend otherwise, his position being, throughout, that respondent accepted these letters as orders in that sense.\nThe respondent emphasized that the appellant was aware of the regulations and that it should be concluded therefrom that it was familiar with these letters of essentiality. Both parties hereto were well aware of and complied with the regulations, though under quite different provisions thereof. The respondent followed the practice of obtaining importation permits, while the appellant was granted a quota under these regulations. There is, however, no evidence to justify the conclusion that the appellant's officers and agents had any knowledge of either the existence or the contents of these letters of essentiality at the time of the execution of the contract, or, indeed, at any time prior to this litigation.\nThe evidence, however, clearly establishes that Cunnings was to inspect the orders and justifies the inference that he would do it at the time of or before the preparation of the list. McLeod himself deposed that because he did not have either the orders or particulars thereof at Vancouver he \"couldn't give them adequate information\u2026 So it was decided to meet in Victoria the following day\" in order that Cunnings and Proctor might \"take a look at the stock they had bought, also to check our orders and make the attached list.\"\nMcLeod, as respondent's manager, had forwarded the letters of essentiality to Ottawa, where he knew they were retained and only the importation permits forwarded to respondent. He, therefore, in Vancouver, when it was arranged for the inspection of the orders next day in Victoria, knew they were not there and could not, therefore, be inspected. Indeed, so far as the evidence discloses, the importation permits in his possession did not evidence the existence of permission to import 74 engines. Moreover, McLeod did not disclose from what records in respondent's office at Victoria he prepared the list of orders. He merely stated that he had done so and that it was being typed when Proctor and Cunnings arrived at respondent's office. When finished, he presented it to them and he says that Bramston and Cunnings looked it over, as well as the importation permits which were on the desk, and Cunnings \"signed it as having received it and being satisfied with it.\" This statement goes quite beyond what Cunnings subscribed to, as the list discloses, and is inadmissible to alter, vary or contradict the writing.\nThat some discussion must have taken place with regard to these orders at Victoria is evident from McLeod's admission that \"we explained to them some of those orders had gone\u2014practically all had gone to Ottawa to secure the permits.\" Moreover, Bramston, in giving his evidence as to what took place in Victoria, states that Cunnings \"asked for a copy of the orders on hand\" and goes on to explain that there was some discussion as to these orders which had gone to Ottawa and that Proctor and Cunnings were shown the importation permits. While Bramston says they did not ask for further information, he does not go so far as to say they accepted the importation permits in lieu of the orders. Bramston's evidence upon this point is consistent with his conduct before both Evans and Cunnings when he was refused delivery at first of five engines and later of one engine. When Evans refused the delivery of the five, Bramston, upon his own evidence, made no comment. He did, however, immediately consult with McLeod and forthwith wrote a letter enclosing the requisitions for the five engines and stating that appellant had, in the letter of January 26, agreed to deliver \"Chrysler marine engines as schedule on attached list.\" When later, on March 16, Cunnings refused, he did not even press upon him that point of view. This further emphasizes the significance of the difference between the evidence of McLeod and Bramston as to the discussion at Victoria relative to the production of the orders.\nThe importation permits upon the desk authorized the importation of 47 engines. McLeod explained there was another permit at the Customs for 20 engines, of which four had already been delivered. Upon McLeod's own evidence they disclosed an authority to import only 63 engines. When it is remembered that these were all business men, it seems difficult to conclude that Cunnings, who had insisted on seeing the orders for 74 engines, should accept such evidence as satisfactory proof of the existence of 74 orders. Moreover, upon the whole of this evidence, Cunnings was denied the inspection of the orders and under these circumstances a conclusion that he accepted an alternative that did not disclose the nature and character of the suggested orders ought to be drawn only where the evidence unequivocally supports that conclusion. Such evidence is not here present. The position might well have been otherwise had Cunnings been shown a copy of the orders, or had their contents been fully explained to him.\nMcLeod's appreciation of the difference between letters of essentiality and orders is evidenced by his statement\nIn some cases we had an order as well, and it was also attached to the application along with that letter of essentiality.\nand later\nIn some cases we had an order along with the letters of essentiality, if so, we included it with the application, but it wasn't strictly necessary because if we didn't have the complete description of the engine they went through just the same.\nIf, in these circumstances, McLeod intended the estimated requirements made in the letters of essentiality to be accepted as orders within the meaning of the contract, he should have either exhibited one of the letters, a copy thereof, or made such explanation of their contents as would have enabled the appellant's representatives to understand the word \"order\" in the sense in which he desired it to be understood. McLeod's failure to do so has created the issue here raised and justifies the application of the rule stated by Blackburn J. in Fowkes v. Manchester and London Life Assurance and Loan Association[16]:\nThe language used by one party is to be construed in the sense in which it would be reasonably understood by the other.\nRespondent submits that the appellant's letter of January 31, written by Cunnings after the contract was concluded, supports its view that the orders were not to be produced, but that 74 engines were to be delivered in accordance with the terms thereof. This letter reads as follows:\nA. G. Cunnings\u2014Terminal Island\nJ. C. Alger\u2014Vancouver\nJanuary 31, 1949.\nc.c. Mr. W. H. Stephenson\u2014Oakland\nMr. E. Evans\u2014Vancouver\nMr. Fred McLeod\u2014McLeod Engines Limited, Victoria, B.C.\nMcLEOD ENGINES LIMITED\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engines Limited has agreed to supply engines to the above company to make deliveries on the list of sales now in our hands at our actual cost, plus $30 to cover our cost of handling.

G. Cunnings\"\nAGC:HS\nA. G. Cunnings\nThe respondent emphasizes not only that in this letter there is no suggestion of any obligation to disclose its orders, but that rather there is a positive assertion that the appellant will \"supply engines\u2026 to make deliveries on the list of sales,\" as well as the direction that respondent \"will issue purchase request with shipping instructions,\" which letter was followed by the delivery of 14 engines in accordance with the terms thereof. The appellant, on the other hand, submits that McLeod had led them to believe the engines were sold, and with this McLeod agrees, and, with that in mind, Cunnings used the word \"sales\" in his letter of instructions. This letter does not cover all of the points agreed upon regarding the delivery of these engines; e.g., it does not refer to the fact that these engines were to be paid for, as, in fact, they were, upon delivery. Moreover, Cunnings does not state in his evidence that the orders were to be shown along with, or at the time of, the requisition. It is further significant that throughout all the evidence it is never suggested that the respondent should surrender the orders to the appellant and, therefore, the purchase request with the shipping orders would be the only record upon which the appellant would make the delivery and from which it would make the whatever record it deemed necessary in relation thereto. It was the latter that was evidently uppermost in Cunnings' mind as he wrote this letter, and, having regard to all of these factors, it cannot be said that this letter necessarily supports the affirmative conclusion that the appellant accepted in Victoria the letters of essentiality as orders, or, as suggested at the hearing, as the appellant's obligation to deliver 74 engines to the respondent.\nWith respect to the 14 engines delivered, Evans, who received the requisition and delivered the orders, states that on two or three occasions he had asked Bramston to show him the orders; that Bramston had not done so and, in fact, had made no reply to his request. Bramston, who gave his evidence first, was not asked as to this conversation and was not recalled and questioned in regard thereto. However, on March 2 Evans did refuse to deliver to Bramston five engines. Bramston at that time made no protest to Evans, but immediately communicated with McLeod.\nMcLeod, as a result of Bramston's communication, did some long-distance telephoning, apparently with Proctor and perhaps others, and, as a result, Cunnings directed the five engines to be delivered and said that he would \"be up in Vancouver.\" In respect to the whole 19 delivered, Cunnings deposed:\nI knew I was coming back up to Vancouver in the near future and I thought I would be able to get things straightened out when I returned here, and as I had made the arrangement originally I didn't want our Vancouver office personnel to get mixed up in it.\nOn March 16 Bramston presented a requisition and a cheque for a further engine. Cunnings was in Vancouver and personally refused the delivery of that engine. There is some discrepancy as to the exact language used. Bramston says Cunnings merely expressed regret that he could not provide the engine and that he himself made no comment, but withdrew immediately. Cunnings, on the other hand, states that he told Bramston he would give him the engine if he produced the order; that Bramston withdrew and he thought he would return, but he never did. Thereafter the matter was dealt with through the solicitors for the respective parties.\nThat 19 engines were delivered without the production of the orders is admitted. The respondent urges that this supports its contention that the orders were not to be produced. Appellant's position is that Cunnings permitted the delivery of the 19 engines in reliance upon McLeod's word that the orders would be submitted. When the orders were not submitted Cunnings apparently concluded that, as he himself had conducted negotiations, he would, when in Vancouver, personally insist on the production of the orders. This is consistent with the appellant's contention throughout that it would deliver the engines if orders therefor were produced by the respondent. There can be no question but that the parties agreed upon this on January 28 at Vancouver and the solicitors' letter written on behalf of the appellant to respondent on March 18, 1949, stated:\nOur clients take the position that they are only obliged to deliver to you under the special arrangement, subject to proper payment therefor, engines for which you can produce firm written orders dated January 26, 1949, or prior thereto.\nUnder these circumstances the delivery of the 19 engines does not assist in determining the issues here raised.\nThe evidence throughout does not support the respondent's contention. The letters, as phrased, were estimates of customers' requirements and not orders for engines to be delivered in the future. An examination of the surrounding circumstances supports that construction. The fact that McLeod construed these letters as orders does not resolve the matter. More important is that, if he intended them as such, having regard to their contents, he should have disclosed it, or made their contents known to the appellant in such a manner that it would have understood the respondent's meaning and intention.\nThe respondent's contention that a change was effected at Victoria, under which these orders were not to be produced, is in conflict with the endorsement made by Cunnings upon the list. If such a change had been effected it would have been of even greater or at least of equal importance to that of the acknowledgment of the receipt thereof and one would have expected that it would have been included in the endorsement. It is also in conflict with respondent's letter of March 2. This letter was written to appellant after Evans refused the delivery of the five engines to Bramston. The latter immediately com- municated with McLeod and, as a consequence thereof, wrote the appellant enclosing the five requisitions and requesting delivery\nunder terms of your letter of January 26, 1949, which specifies that your Company, Canadian Atlas Diesel Engines Ltd. shall deliver our company, McLeod Engines Limited, Chrysler Marine Engines as scheduled on attached list.\nThe respondent, therefore, as late as March 2, was relying upon the contract as made at Vancouver on January 26 under which McLeod had agreed the orders would be inspected.\nMoreover, the evidence of McLeod and Bramston, quite apart from the endorsement made by Cunnings on the attached sheet and the letter of March 2, does not justify a conclusion that any such change was agreed upon. The subsequent letter of instructions and the delivery of the 19 engines is as consistent with the appellant's reliance upon the subsequent submission of the orders as with the contention of the respondent.\nThe evidence, as a whole, justifies the conclusion that the parties negotiated and concluded the contract at Vancouver under which the appellant would purchase the stock on hand and deliver to the respondent the engines for which it held orders. At that meeting the respondent was not in a position to give the particulars of the orders and it was agreed that they would be inspected the next day. This vital term of the contract has never been implemented by the respondent and nothing that took place at Victoria or thereafter justifies a conclusion that the appellant had accepted anything in lieu thereof.\nThe Court of Appeal varied the judgment of the learned trial judge by deleting an item in the damages. Respondent cross-appealed to this Court with respect to that item. In view of the conclusions arrived at, it is unnecessary to deal therewith.\nThe appeal is allowed, the cross-appeal dismissed and the action dismissed with costs throughout to the appellant.\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [17] which, by a decision of the majority of its members, affirmed the judg- ment for damages awarded to the respondent at the trial. Sydney Smith, J.A. dissented and would have dismissed the action.\nWhile it is sufficient, in my opinion, for the determination of the appeal to decide whether the documents referred to in the proceedings as \"letters of essentiality\" were orders within the meaning of that expression as used in the agreement evidenced by the letter written by the appellant to the respondent dated January 26, 1949, in view of the claim for the rectification of the agreement in the counterclaim and of the course of the trial, it is necessary to review the evidence as to the events leading up to the making of the agreement and as to what occurred immediately thereafter.\nBy an agreement dated July 19, 1948, made between the Chrysler Corporation and the respondent, the latter was granted the right to sell Chrysler Marine Engines, parts and accessories in the cities of Victoria and Prince Rupert. The term of this agreement was for one year but it was provided that either party might terminate it by written notice to be given in a defined manner. The appellant company, by agreements dated respectively April 9, 1947, and January 3, 1949, was granted similar rights in the Districts of Vancouver and Westminster. By the Emergency Exchange Conservation Act (c. 7, Statutes of Canada, 1948) restrictions were imposed upon the importation of certain goods into Canada, these including Diesel Engines of the type supplied by the Chrysler Corporation to both parties from the United States. Permits allowing the importation of such goods might be obtained on application to the Minister of Trade and Commerce in a manner thereafter prescribed by regulations made by the Governor in Council. In practice, under these regulations, prospective importers of goods from the United States were required to satisfy the Minister that the goods sought to be imported were required for some purpose approved by him. In the present matter the only market with which the parties were concerned was the sale of engines for use in the fishing industry, a purpose apparently regarded by the Minister as one for which importation should be permitted. In the Fall of 1948 the respondent took steps to obtain such engines as it might expect to require for its business in British Columbia during the year following. On August 14, 1948, it obtained a letter from a company engaged in the fishing and fish packing industry, Nelson Brothers Fisheries Limited, reading as follows:\u2014\nAfter a careful study of Chrysler Engines which we will require for the 1949 season, we estimate that we will need ten (10) Chrysler Crowns and five (5) Chrysler Ace Engines with 2 1\/2 to 1 reduction.\nWe trust that you will be able to make delivery of these engines, as required, during the Spring of 1949.\nBy letter dated October 7, 1948, the Canadian Fishing Company Limited wrote to the respondent giving its estimate of the number of Chrysler engines it would require in the next several months as being approximately 20 Chrysler Crown and Chrysler Ace engines with 21\/2 to 1 reduction gears, saying that they were to be used as power plants for commercial fishing vessels used exclusively in the commercial fisheries of British Columbia, and concluding:\u2014\nWe sincerely trust that you will be able to make delivery of these engines when required.\nOn October 8, 1948, British Columbia Packers Limited wrote to the respondent saying that its estimated requirements of Chrysler engines for the 1949 season were approximately 30 engines, of which 15 would be Chrysler Aces and 15 Chrysler Crowns with 2 1\/2 to 1 reduction gears, and concluding:\u2014\nWe hope this letter will assist you in being able to have engines available for our requirements.\nBy letter dated October 13, 1948, the Anglo-British Columbia Packing Company Limited advised the respondent that during the course of the next six months it would require three Chrysler Crown engines with reductions and ten Chrysler Aces with reductions, that the engines would be used exclusively for their own fish boats and their fishermen's boats, concluding:\u2014\nTrusting you will be in a position to deliver these engines as required.\nBy letter dated October 21, 1948, Kyuquot Trollers Cooperative Association informed the respondent that it had made a survey of its probable Chrysler marine engine requirements during the next few months and estimated that seven would be needed and, in addition to certifying that the engines would be used only to propel the commercial fishing boats of its fishermen, said:\u2014\nWe trust you will be in a position to deliver these engines to us as needed during the present season. The letters from the British Columbia Packers Limited and Nelson Brothers Fisheries Limited were accepted as sufficient by the Emergency Import Control Branch of the Department of Trade and Commerce and permits to import 45 Chrysler engines for the purpose of resale to these companies were issued on December 2, 1948. Two other permits, each for one Chrysler marine engine, granted for resale to two commercial fishermen were issued on December 15 and December 20 respectively. The documents obtained from these prospective purchasers for the purpose of obtaining the permits were not produced at the trial.\nOn January 24, 1948, F. B. McLeod, president of the respondent company, met R. H. Proctor, the West Coast divisional manager for the Chrysler Marine and Industrial Engine Division of the Chrysler Corporation at Seattle, at the latter's request. Questions had arisen between the parties to this action as to their respective selling rights on the Pacific Coast and it had apparently been decided by the Chrysler Corporation that these differences should be composed. A. G. Cunnings, the manager of the Chrysler Marine and Industrial Engine Division of Atlas Imperial Diesel Engine Company, an American corporation of which the appellant is a subsidiary, took part in the discussions which were continued on the following day at a hotel in Vancouver. In the result, the respondent company agreed to surrender its Chrysler franchise and to sell its stock of Chrysler engines and accessories to the appellant on terms which were defined in a letter written by the appellant to the respondent, reading as follows:\u2014\nHOTEL VANCOUVER\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 26, 1949.\nMcLeod Engines, Limited,\n1221 Wharf Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\nGentlemen:\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. of Vancouver, B.C., agrees to buy from McLeod Engines Ltd., all their stock of Chrysler marine engines, Chrysler marine parts, and marine accessories; also one Dodge service truck.\nIt is agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will pay wages of one parts man in Victoria, and one parts man in Vancouver, as from January 28, 1949, for taking inventory of stocks on hand.\nIt is further agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will supply to McLeod Engines Limited the parts necessary to complete engines now being overhauled at Begg Brothers Limited. These parts to be supplied at cost. It is further agreed that Canadian Atlas Diesel Engine Co. will supply McLeod Engines Limited with the necessary Chrysler engines to complete the orders shown on the attached sheet.\nAll merchandise purchased will be first-class condition and at actual cost.\nThe above is agreed to when mutual termination of Chrysler marine franchise in the Province of British Columbia is negotiated.\nYours very truly,\nCANADIAN ATLAS DIESEL ENGINE CO. LTD.\nper: A. G. Cunnings.\nWhen, according to McLeod, Cunnings asked for a list of the orders referred to, he told him that the records were in Victoria and said that if Proctor and Cunnings would come to Victoria on the following day, he (McLeod) would have the list ready. On January 27 the parties met again at the office of the respondent in Victoria, at which time McLeod says that the import permits for 47 engines were shown to Proctor and Cunnings. McLeod had dictated and presented to Cunnings a letter purporting to contain a list of the orders which his company had on hand and giving information as to the number of engines already delivered. This read as follows:\u2014\n1221 Wharf Street\nVictoria, B.C.\nJanuary 27, 1949\nMr. A. G. Cunnings,\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Co.,\n1859 West Georgia Street,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nAs agreed in our meeting yesterday, we are listing below orders we have on hand, and in the other column, numbers of engines that have been delivered against these orders.

The letter was clearly intended to take the place of the list of \"orders shown on the attached sheet\" mentiond in the fourth paragraph of the letter of January 26. McLeod says that at this time the respondent had 16 other import permits at the Customs House, presumably in Victoria. The original letters from the four packing companies and the Kyuquot Trollers Co-Operative Association, according to him, had been sent to Ottawa for the purpose of obtaining permits and apparently no copies were available. It is not suggested that their contents or the contents of whatever documents had been obtained to enable the respondent to obtain the other 16 permits were made known to Proctor or Cunnings. Nothing in the nature of written orders for any engines was produced to them.\nThe list given to Cunnings, as will be noted, contained no specifications of the engines for which the respondent had orders. It would be necessary, according to him, for the purpose of ordering an engine to have particulars as to whether engines with reduction gears were required, whether they were to have straight drives, right or left hand rotation, the size of the shaft required, and whether they were to have six or twelve volt ignition. The permits for the 47 engines, which McLeod says were produced at Victoria, merely specified that the engines imported were to be marine engines \"with 2-56 to 1 reduction gears and 6 volt electrical systems.\" McLeod clearly knew, while Proctor and Cunnings did not, that the documents obtained from their customers and which, he said, had been sent to Ottawa, did not contain the necessary particulars.\nIf any evidence were needed (and I think it is not) to establish the fact, it is made clear in the cross-examination of McLeod that he intended by the letter of January 27 to represent to Proctor and Cunnings that the respondent had orders from the parties named for the number of engines stated or, as he also expressed it, that \"we had those sold.\" Following the discussion at Victoria, Cunnings, who lived in the United States, dictated a memorandum, a copy of which was sent to McLeod at Victoria. That document was in the following terms:\u2014\nA. G. Cunnings\u2014Terminal Island\nJ. C. Alger\u2014Vancouver\nJanuary 31, 1949\nc.c. Mr. W. H. Stephenson\u2014Oakland,\nMr. E. Evans\u2014Vancouver,\nMr. Fred McLeod\u2014McLeod Engines\nLimited, Victoria, B.C.\nMcLEOD ENGINES LIMITED\nCanadian Atlas Diesel Engines Limited has agreed to supply engines to the above company to make deliveries on the list of sales now in our hands at our actual cost, plus $30 to cover our cost of handling. All engines are to be started in our shop to insure engines being in proper mechanical condition at time of delivery.\nMcLeod Engines Limited will issue purchase request with shipping instructions for each engine, and will also issue payment for same direct to Canadian Atlas Diesel Engines Limited.\nThe matter of fishermen's rebate will be worked out between Mr. Evans and McLeod Engines Limited.\n(Sgd.) A. G. Cunnings.\nBetween the date of this memorandum and March 18, 1949, 19 of the 74 engines were delivered at the direction of the respondent to their customers. No written orders from the purchasers were produced in order to obtain these engines. On the latter date an officer of the respondent company requisitioned a Chrysler marine engine and was told by Cunnings that if he would bring in a purchase order given before January 27 the appellant would supply the engine, whereupon the officer (Bramston) left and did not return. Thereafter the matter was dealt with in correspondence by the solicitors for the respective parties and the action followed.\nThe point to be decided is the meaning to be assigned to the word \"orders\" in the letter of January 26, 1949. The issue is not affected, in my opinion, either by what took place at Victoria on January 27 or by the terms of the memorandum of January 31. The signature of Cunnings on the letter of January 27 was, as the document shows, merely an acknowledgment of the receipt of the letter. The document was admittedly given for the sole purpose of furnishing details of the orders mentioned in the letter given the day previous and, accepting McLeod's own version of the matter, nothing that took place at Victoria altered the position of the parties. The memorandum of January 31 was prepared for the purpose only of recording for the information of the appellant's officers in Vancouver and of W. H. Stephenson of Oakland (whose status is not given) particulars of the manner in which the undertaking given on January 26 was to be carried out. That in preparing this memorandum there was no intention to contract on the part of the appellant seems perfectly clear upon the evidence.\nThe documents upon which, the respondent must rely as constituting orders. are the letters which it obtained from the Canadian Fishing Company Limited, British Columbia Packers Limited, Anglo-British Columbia Packing Company Limited and Kyuquot Trollers Co-Operative Association prior to January 26, 1949. The judgment delivered at the trial and that of Mr. Justice Robertson in the Court of Appeal [18] proceed on the footing that the word \"orders\" in the letter of January 26 should be construed as including these letters. With great respect, I am unable to agree with this conclusion. The pleadings of the respondent do not assert that by custom in the trade or otherwise the word \"orders\" should be construed otherwise than in accordance with its commonly accepted meaning. Oral evidence was admitted from various purchasing agents of the parties by whom these letters were written as to what was intended to be conveyed by them, some asserting that the intention was to obligate their employers and others to the contrary, that they were merely estimates. All of this evidence was, in my opinion, inadmissible: in the absence of any ambiguity in the language employed and in the state of the pleadings, the question of interpretation was for the trial judge. The word \"order\" is one which in different contexts may have a variety of meanings: in the business of buying and selling goods its commonly accepted meaning is, in my opinion, that assigned to it in the New Oxford Dictionary, namely, a direction to make, provide or furnish anything at the responsibility of the person ordering. The letters from Nelson Brothers Fisheries Limited, the Canadian Fishing Company Limited, the British Columbia Packers Limited and the Kyuquot Trollers Co-Operative Association were by their very terms simply estimates of the requirements of marine engines of these various organizations during the coming season and included an expression of hope that the respondents would be in a position to deliver these engines when required. The language of the letter from the Anglo-British Columbia Packing Company Limited of October 13, 1948, varied in this respect that it contained the statement that the company would require 13 engines during the course of the next six months. None of these letters were acknowledged by the respondent. None of them contained a direction or request to supply goods or an offer capable of acceptance. The purpose of giving these documents to the respondent was to enable the latter to apply for import permits to the Department of Trade and Commerce and for that purpose alone. Both parties contemplated that when the engines were required, orders would be given, at which time of necessity the particulars of the required machine would be furnished. While, according to the letter of January 27, 1949, several of the engines for which the respondent claimed to have orders from the packing companies and the Kyuquot Trollers were said to have been theretofore delivered. The actual orders, pursuant to which they were delivered, were not produced. What was done, however, in the case of the British Columbia Packers Limited is made clear from two written orders from this company for the delivery of Chrysler engines which were sent to the respondent by their purchasing agents, Mills and Packers Limited, on January 25, and in the case of Nelson Brothers Fisheries Limited by their written order for one Chrysler engine date February 9, 1949, addressed to the respondent. Indeed McLeod, while being cross-examined, after referring to the letters from the four packing companies which, he said, had been sent to Ottawa to obtain import permits and being asked if that was all that he had said replied:\u2014\"In some cases we had an order as well and it was also attached to the application along with that letter of essentiality,\" the latter expression referring to letters of the nature obtained from the fishing companies. The learned trial judge attached importance to the fact that Cunnings signed the letter of January 27, 1949, written by the respondent, saying in part:\u2014\nThat was the time to stipulate for the production of confirmatory evidence of the orders. He signed without reservation or stipulation.\nThe document itself makes it clear that Cunnings' signature at the bottom of the letter in question was merely to acknowledge its receipt and I find nothing in the evidence to suggest that he signed for any other purpose. A further passage from the reasons for judgment states that the learned trial judge was completely satisfied that the present appellant knew perfectly well the practice which prevailed as between the fishing companies and importers and that \"it substantially knew the nature of the documents which the plaintiff was treating as orders.\" As to this, McLeod had said that Proctor was aware of the procedure to be followed in obtaining import permits, and again that Proctor \"had watched me for months obtaining these things (permits).\" As to this, the Emergency Exchange Conservation Act of 1948 had only been proclaimed in April of that year and there is no evidence of any practice which prevailed in regard to obtaining these permits as between the fishing companies and importers, or as to how they had been obtained by any importer other than the respondent. Proctor was an employee of the Chrysler Corporation and not, so far as the evidence shows, connected in any manner with the appellant, though he was familiar with its business dealings with his own employers, and even had Proctor been aware of the terms of the so-called letters of essentiality obtained from the fishing companies (and there is no evidence that he was so aware) it could not, in my opinion, affect the obligation of the appellant under the agreement of January 26.\nThe learned trial judge further accepted the evidence of McLeod and the respondent's other witnesses where they differed from those called on behalf of the appellant. The appellant had by its counterclaim asked for the rectification of the agreement on the ground that the letters did not express the terms agreed upon and that it was intended that the obligation of the appellant was simply \"to fulfil bona fide and enforceable orders.\" Some evidence was given for the appellant that some such expressions had been used in the course of the negotiations and this was rejected. Apart from the learned judge's finding, which was fatal to the claim for rectification, I am unable to appreciate the necessity for any such rectification. The word \"orders\" without more would import that they were orders given in good faith. Except as the question of credibility affected this issue, the decision of the matter did not depend upon the weight to be assigned to the evidence: the question was one of the construction of the language contained in a writing.\nThe parties to this transaction were experienced business men who after negotiations resulting in an agreement between them evidenced that agreement by the letter of January 26, 1949. Their intention is to be gathered from what I regard as the clear and unambiguous terms of that document. The obligation of the appellant was not to supply a defined number of engines but rather the engines required to complete the orders which the respondent claimed to have. The list given by the respondents to the appellant on January 27 did not contain, so far as the evidence shows, the names of any persons who had given orders for engines to the respondent. In my opinion, no breach of the agreement by the appellant has been shown.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout and direct that the action be dismissed. The cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed, both with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Campney, Owen, Murphy & Owen.\n[1] [1951] 1 W.W.R.

It had snowed for several hours before the accident and the snow had not been cleaned off the doors which were partially concealed. The trial judge found that the studs on the doors had been worn down during the years and that some had entirely disappeared, that the doors appeared to have sagged and were uneven and sloped, and that they were not in a reasonably good state of repair. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, and found that the studs were worn but that there was no evidence that the worn condition of the doors was the cause of the accident.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action maintained. There was evidence to justify the finding that the fall was caused by the slope of the doors. The appellant was entitled to find the sidewalk safe and convenient for travel. The respondent had placed the doors in the sidewalk, and by allowing them to sag and become uneven and sloped, had interfered with the rights of the public and impeded the way of the appellant as a traveller on the highway.\nThe contention of the respondent that it had no authority to repair the doors since they were part of the sidewalk fails since from time to time the doors were opened and used by the respondent.\nCastor v. Corporation of Uxbridge (1876) 39 U.C.Q.B. 113 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the action for damages suffered by the appellant when she slipped on the sidewalk.\nL. St. G. Stubbs and Harry P. Beahen for the appellant. There was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact of the trial judge and the judgment based thereon. There was insufficient evidence to support the findings of fact of the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal did not show that there was demonstrable error in the trial court in law or in fact. This was on public property but controlled by the respondent.\nThe case of Hamilton v. Parish of St. George 1 is not applicable, but the cases of Hopkins v. Corp. of Owen Sound 2 and Rushton v. Galley 3 are relied on.\nF. M. Burbidge Q.C. for the respondent. The onus is on the appellant to establish that her fall was due to the worn condition of the studs. If the matter is left in doubt and a fortiori, if the proper inference from the evidence indicates that she slipped on the snow, then she failed to prove her case. Burgess v. Southampton 4. The appeal does not involve the reversal of the trial judge on a question of fact but on the proper inferences to be drawn from undisputed facts. Not only did she not make her case but there was no case to be made. There is no positive evidence as to where she fell and what caused her to fall.\nThe duty was to keep the sidewalk in a reasonable state of repair. And the sidewalk was in such a state. The action is based on nonfeasance and not misfeasance. Crafter v. Metropolitan Ry. Co. 5. The evidence establishes that the doors were in a reasonable state of repair and the cases of Ewing v. Toronto 6 and Anderson v. Toronto 7 are relied on.\nThe doors were in the sidewalk with the consent and approval of the town, and being part of the sidewalk, the duty to keep the sidewalk, including the doors, in repair was on the town. The case of Ewing v. Hewitt 8 is directly at point and is sufficient to dispose of the present case.\nThe cases of Hamilton v. Parish of St. George 9; Vestry of St. Matthew v. School Board for London 10 ; Horridge v. Makinson 11 ; Callaway v. Newman Mercantile Co. 12; and Schoeni v. King 13 are relied on.\nThe Hopkins case (supra) does not apply and the Rushton case (supra) is rather in respondent's favour. The judgment of Kerwin, Kellock, Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff, Mrs. Lilly McArter, against the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, which had reversed the judgment at the trial of Campbell J., awarding the appellant $3,038.58 against the respondent A. E. Hill Limited, the correct name of which company counsel agreed is A. E. Hill Company, Limited. Originally the Town of Hartney was also a defendant but the trial judge dismissed the action as against it on the ground that proper notice had not been given it under section 463 of the Municipal Act, and there was no appeal from that determination. After the decision of the Court of Appeal and the certification by its Registrar of the Case, stated and agreed on by the parties to the appeal to this Court, the plaintiff appellant applied for an order amending the Case. We remitted the Case to the Court of Appeal, and that Court made an order amending it by the substitution of one word for another in this direct examination of the appellant at the trial:\u2014\nQ. You say you stepped, what happened? The door didn't get up and smack you in the face?\nA. It certainly didn't. I don't know whether I slipped, I presume I must have slipped because after you could see the mark where I had cleared the snow off the top of the snow.\nThe word \"door\" was substituted for the last word \"snow\". The significance of this amendment will become apparent later.\nAbout 6 p.m. on December 4, 1948, the appellant was proceeding southerly on the cement sidewalk on Railway Street in Hartney, adjoining the west side of a store building owned and occupied by the respondent. About midway between the front and rear of this building, two iron trapdoors with studs on the top had been installed in\u2014and flush with\u2014the sidewalk, and were hinged on their outer edges to enable them to be opened. The trap-doors were about 8 feet in width, measured from the wall of the building, by 4 feet measured along the length of the sidewalk. The sidewalk from the wall of the building was 10 feet 8 inches wide, of which the trap-doors took up the first 8 feet, so that 32 inches of cement extended from the westerly edge of the doors to the westerly edge of the sidewalk. These trap-doors had been installed by the respondent about 1902 and, therefore, prior to the incorporation of the town in 1904. The cement sidewalk had been constructed by the town about 1930. The doors and the elevator in the area beneath the level of the sidewalk were used by, and were under the control of the respondent.\nSnow had fallen the night previous and during the day of December 4, including the afternoon, but it had ceased snowing at the time of the accident. I agree with the inference drawn by the trial judge that the snow had not been cleaned off the doors and that they were partially concealed by it. I also agree with him that the studs on the doors had been worn down during the years and that in fact on the westerly limits of the doors some had entirely disappeared. The witness Baxter testified that \"there is a hollowed out part where the door is bent down\" and some of the photographs show, as the trial judge states, that the doors \"appear to have sagged and, as a consequence were uneven and slightly sloped.\" His finding, therefore, that the trap-doors were not in \"a reasonably good state of repair\" was justified.\nThe appellant slipped and sustained injuries for which damages were claimed and awarded by the trial judge. On the second page of his reasons in the case, he found that while the appellant had testified generally that some of the studs were missing at the time, she had not given evidence showing the missing studs to have been contiguous to each other or that she had stepped on any point where the studs were missing. However, in the witness box she had pointed to a spot on a photograph, made an exhibit at the trial, as indicating where she had fallen and testified that it was \"about a foot in from the edge of the door.\" Counsel for the appellant argued that this was sufficient to warrant the finding of the trial judge, on the third page of his reasons: \"I find that some studs were missing from the doors and the plaintiff stepped upon that area and slipped and fell by reason of the absence of studs and the slope of the doors.\" While I am not satisfied that the appellant fell by reason of the absence of the studs, I do think that there was evidence to justify the finding that the fall was caused by the slope of the doors. As to Mr. Burbidge's contention that the statement of claim did not allege any such condition, I am of opinion that the allegation therein that the respondent was negligent \"(a) in the construction and operation of the said trap-doors\" covers the point.\nSpeaking for the Court of Appeal, Adamson, J.A., after referring to the finding of the trial judge on the third page remarked that while there was no doubt that the studs were worn, there was no evidence that the worn condition of the trap-doors was the cause of the accident. He then referred to the evidence of the appellant transcribed above. In view of the change made in the transscript of the evidence, the conclusion drawn by the Court of Appeal, that the snow had been packed on the sidewalk and that fresh loose snow lay on the packed snow, does not appear to be warranted. Adamson J.A. continued: \"She does not say that the worn condition of the doors caused her to slip and there is no evidence on which to base such an inference.\" As indicated above, I am inclined to agree with this statement, if it referred only to the studs, but it takes no account of the condition caused by the slope of the doors and, therefore, on that question of fact, I agree with the trial judge and his judgment should be restored unless the respondent is able to show that it is not responsible in law.\nLong ago it was laid down in 1 Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, 700:\u2014\nThere is no doubt but that all injuries whatsoever to any highway, as by digging a ditch or making a hedge overthwart it, or laying logs of timber in it, or by doing any other act which will render it less commodious to the King's people, are public nuisances at common law.\nThis extract and the old cases on the subject are referred to in the judgment of Chief Justice Harrison in Castor v. Corporation of Uxbridge 14. As he there points out, every obstruction which to a substantial degree renders unsafe or inconvenient the exercise of the right of the public to pass and repass on foot and with horses and carriages at their free will and pleasure over the highway is a violation of that right: per Erle C.J. in Regina v. Train 15. It was also pointed out in the Castor case that the plaintiff, if free from contributory negligence, would have the right to sue the company that had placed the poles on the highway thereby causing an unlawful obstacle. In the cases in England cited by the Chief Justice, the underlying principle is taken for granted and the same principle was followed in Ontario.\nIn Hopkins v. Owen Sound and Trotter 16, Ferguson J. held that a person who, with the knowledge of, and without objection by, a municipal corporation, constructs across a ditch between the sidewalk and crown of the highway an approach therefrom to enable vehicles to pass to and from his property, adjacent to the highway, is liable for injuries sustained, through want of repair of the approach, by a person using it to cross the highway. This decision was cited with approval by Riddell J. in a Divisional Court in Rushton v. Galley 17. In the present case the appellant was entitled to find the sidewalk safe and convenient for travel. The respondent had placed the doors in the sidewalk, and by allowing them to sag and become uneven and sloped, had interfered with the rights of the public and impeded the way of the appellant as a traveller on the highway.\nIn the statement of claim the appellant had pleaded that the respondent had constructed the areaway under the sidewalk and placed the trap-doors over it with the consent, licence and approval of the town. Whether the latter part of this allegation was directed only towards the town, which was then a party to the action, need not be discussed because Mr. Burbidge takes the position that it must be assumed that the work was done with such consent. Without agreeing with that as a proposition of law, it is only necessary to point out that no authority was cited for the town (or its predecessor, a rural municipality) to give such consent and to authorize an impediment to the right of travel. Then the contention was advanced that the respondent had no authority to repair the doors since they were part of the sidewalk and, therefore, situate on the highway. If, as the respondent contends, it had in fact the leave and licence of the town (or the rural municipality) to construct the areaway and install the elevator and doors, it is difficult to see how this argument can have any basis since from time to time the doors were opened and used by the respondent. The decision in Ewing v. Hewitt 18 has not been overlooked but in this view of the present appeal, it need not be considered.\nThe decision in Hamilton v. The Vestry of the Parish of St. George 19, relied on has no application as it was concerned with the construction of an Act of Parliament and it was held that a certain area did not fall within the term \"cellar\" as used in the statute. Nor is the case of Horridge v. Makinson 20 of assistance as all that was held there was that where a nuisance had been created by a highway authority on a highway under their control, the owner or occupier of the land adjoining the highway was not liable in an accident caused by the nuisance.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout. However, the costs of the motion to this Court to remit the Case to the Court of Appeal should be paid by the appellant as it was her oversight that occasioned the transcript of the evidence going to the Court of Appeal for the purposes of the appeal thereto, in the form in which it appeared; and that transcript had been approved by both parties as part of the Case submitted to this Court.\nRand J.:\u2014The judgment in appeal was based on an error in the transcription of the testimony of the plaintiff which was corrected for the purposes of this appeal. The sentence originally appeared as \"I presume I must have slipped because after, you could see the mark where I had cleared the snow off the top of the snow.\" This last word should have been \"door\". Adamson J.A., after quoting that answer, says :\u2014\nThis indicates that the snow had been packed on the sidewalk and that fresh loose snow lay on the packed snow. Slipping on the packed snow is the reason she gives for her fall. She does not say that the worn condition of the doors caused her to slip and there is no evidence on which to base such an inference.\nThe fact that she had slipped because of the worn condition of the studs and the slope of the doors was expressly found by the trial judge. That the defendant was under a duty to keep the substitution for the sidewalk in reasonably safe condition, cannot, in my opinion, be seriously questioned : but if it could be heard to say that since there was no right to be where it was, there was no duty, the action would lie in nuisance. The doors had been in place for 48 years without renewal or repair. Taken with the evidence of the plaintiff, there was, I think, sufficient support for the finding made.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stubbs, Stubbs & Stubbs.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laird, MacInnes, Burbidge, Hetherington, Allison and Campbell.\n1 (1873) L.R. 9 Q.B. 42.\n2 (1896) 27 O.R. 43.\n3 (1910) 21 O.L.R. 135.\n4 [1933] O.R. 279.\n5 (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 300.\n6 29 O.R. 197.\n7 (1908) 15 O.L.R. 643.\n8 (1900) 27 O.A.R. 296.\n9 (1873) L.R. 9 Q.B. 42.\n10 [1898] A.C. 190.\n11 (1915) 84 L.J.K.B. 1294.\n12 (1928) 12 S.W.

Fletcher.\nThe respondent was the owner of a building divided into four adjoining units, the fourth of which was under lease to the appellant. The basement of the first unit was separated from the second by a 2' thick stone and concrete wall; the second from the third by a wooden partition; the third from the fourth by a stone wall in which there were two wooden doors. Water entered into the first unit from a 12\" street main through a 4\" pipe. The end of this pipe was enlarged into a \"bell\" into which, for the purpose of reducing the flow to 2\", an iron plug was inserted. At the time the action arose, March 1, 1948, the first unit was undergoing alterations, then in progress some two months. The ground floor windows were without glass and boarded up and at least one window in the basement was broken or open. The unit was unheated except for portable oil burners used during the day. There was a 4\" trap to carry off water in the basement floor but this drain at the time was covered with 18\" of concrete and sand. The temperature dropped from 19 degrees above zero during the day to 9 degrees below zero at midnight. At about 10:15 p.m. water was noticed flowing out of the basement windows, and the Water Department and Edgar LeBlanc, president of the respondent company, notified. The water officials thereupon closed off the water but LeBlanc, believing nothing further could then be done, did not visit the premises until 8 o'clock the next morning. It was then found that the reducing plug had been dislodged from the bell and that water had seeped through the different; basement walls into that of the appellant causing damage to goods stored there in respect of which it claimed to recover damages. Its action was dismissed by the trial judge whose judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting) that the appeal should be allowed and the case referred back to the trial Court to fix the amount of damages on evidence adduced at the trial with liberty to both sides to adduce further evidence.\nPer: Rinfret C.J. and Rand J. The Appellant's claim was put on three grounds: negligence, nuisance, and the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, L.R. 3 H.L. 330. The case for negligence was not made out. In the other grounds the first question was whether the maintenance of a 4\" water pipe was an ordinary or necessary use or one to be treated as special? It was not so to the requirements of the respondent: it was equally exceptional in the general use of water; and it created a substantial addition to the ordinary risks to the neighbouring premises. These enhanced risks were prima facie risks of the person creating them and there was nothing before the Court to take the case outside the scope of the rule. Richards v. Lothian, [1913] A.C. 263 at 280 approving Blake v. Woolf, [1898] 2 Q.B. 426. Musgrove v. Pandelis, [1919] 2 K.B. 42 and Mulholland v. Baker, [1939] 3 All E.R. 253 followed. When the respondent was notified the basement had filled a duty to act promptly arose and as a minimum of precaution it should have apprised the appellant. Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan, [1940] A.C. 880; Pope v. Fraser & Southern Rolling and Wire Mills Ltd., 155 L.T.R. 324; Northwestern Utilities Ltd. v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., [1936], A.C. 108.\nPer: Kerwin and Estey JJ. The evidence justified the conclusion that the plug was forced out by the freezing of the pipes and that the respondent was negligent in not taking steps to prevent such an occurrence. McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co., [1905] A.C. 72; Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington, [1932] A.C. 215.\nThe finding that LeBlanc had reasonable grounds for believing that the water would not escape through the wall into the adjoining premises could not be supported. A reasonable man having regard to the location of the wall and its age would have appreciated the possibility of seepage.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting). There was no direct evidence of any freezing and the trial judge was right in declining to draw an inference that the frost caused the plug to be dislodged. There was no duty upon the respondent to provide a drain of such size as to carry off water admitted into the basement without fault on its part. The failure of the respondent to take steps to rid the basement' of water until 8 o'clock the following morning was not in the circumstances actionable negligence. Assuming that the condition in the respondent's basement constituted a nuisance, the condition not having been brought about by any voluntary or negligent act of the appellant, failure to take steps to abate it until 8 o'clock the following morning was not undue delay imposing liability upon the respondent. Noble v. Harrison, [1926], 2 K.B. 332 at 338; Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan, [1940] A.C. 880 at 893 and 904.\nThere was no evidence upon which to base a conclusion that to bring water for commercial use into a business premises in a four-inch pipe was a non-natural and not merely an ordinary use and the principle in Rylands v. Fletcher did not apply. Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan, supra at 888.\nDecision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division (27 M.P.R. 159), reversed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division 1, Hughes J. dissenting, affirming the judgment of Anglin J., dismissing an action for damages.\nD. K. McTavish K.C. and J. C. Osborne for the appellant. The appellant alleged at the trial and on the appeal (1) Negligence on the part of the respondent. (2) Nuisance created by the respondent. (3) The respondent had in its control something which escaped and under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher 2 was liable for damage done as a result of the escape. On the question of negligence, the appellant alleges that the water pipes were solely within the control of the respondent and burst as a result of freezing action, the respondent having failed in sub-zero weather to heat the premises or take any precautions to avoid such freezing. If the evidence supports the allegations made by the appellant, that is proof of such allegations and, in the absence of any explanation by the respondent, adequate proof, which must be accepted by the Court. It is not up to the appellant to establish these allegations beyond a reasonable doubt as this is not a criminal matter. The three learned judges who rendered the judgment which is the subject of this appeal, agreed that the evidence was sufficient to justify an affirmative inference (1) that the water in the pipes froze and (2) that as a result the pipes burst or expanded forcing out the plug or reducer. They further agreed that the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding that the unheated cellar caused the freezing of the water in the pipes, resulting in the forcing out of the reducer and plug, the escaping of the water into the cellar, its seeping through the basement wall of the Creamery premises and the damage to the appellant. The appellant respectfully agrees with the conclusions reached by the learned judges in this respect. The standard definition of negligence is stated by Alderson B. in Blyth v. Birmingham Water Works Co. 3 as: \"The omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do\".\nThe respondent did not show that he had taken all reasonable precautions and therefore was negligent in respect to the freezing of the pipes. MacArthur v. Dominion Cartridge 4.\nThe respondent was negligent towards the appellant by reason of the fact that the water so released by the bursting pipes seeped through several walls into the premises of the appellant, thus damaging its stock stored in the basement. There was additional negligence on its part in that its president and general manager, Leblanc, did nothing to prevent this seeping after he was advised that there was water on the Creamery premises which was flowing out of the basement windows. A reasonable person would have taken some action to prevent the spread of this water and if the respondent had even advised the appellant, it might have been able to remove all of its stock from the basement and the damage would have been avoided. In addition to the negligence alleged in connection with the freezing of the pipes, the respondent was negligent in not having the drain in the Creamery premises in proper working order. With respect to the finding by the Chief Justice in the Court below that it could not be reasonably held that LeBlanc should have known or suspected that the water would seep through the cellar wall. It is submitted that this finding is incorrect and that any reasonable person and more particularly an experienced plumber such as LeBlanc should instantly have foreseen the danger. In any event whether the respondent could, or could not, have forseen the ultimate result of its negligence, is not a question to be considered in fixing liability. It could have forseen that if a large amount of water accumulated on its premises so that water was flowing out of the basement windows damage might result to some one and therefore it owed a duty of care and the fact that it could not forsee the water seeping through several walls into the premises of the appellant is not a question to be considered. In Re Polemis 5; Salmond's Law of Torts, 10 Ed. 137; Smith v. London & Southwestern Ry. Co. 6.\nThe appellant, apart from the question of negligence, alleges the respondent created a nuisance which resulted in damage to the property of the appellant and is therefore liable to the appellant for that damage. Nuisance is wrongful interference with another's enjoyment of his lands and premises by the use of land or premises either occupied or owned by oneself. Negligence is not an essential ingredient. Sedleigh-Denfield v. St. Joseph's Missions 7; Charing Cross v. London Hydraulic Power Co .8. These cases are in point with the appellant's case. The respondent by letting water escape from its premises to those of the appellant created a nuisance for which it is responsible in damages. See also Humphries v. Cousins 9.\nThe principle laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher 10 is applicable in this case. \"The true rule of law is that the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collected and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is a natural consequence of its escape.\" The uncontradicted evidence shows that the water supply from the pipes in question was brought on the premises for the sole benefit of the respondent and not for the communal benefit of the appellant or any one else so that this case is to be distinguished from that line of cases where the defendant was held not liable for damage resulting from the release of water from a plumbing fixture which was installed in the interests of both parties. The use of water by the respondent was not for ordinary domestic purposes but was an unnatural user in the circumstances so as to bring the case within the principle. Under that rule the respondent must at its peril keep such water from escaping which it failed to do and therefore the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed to the question of damages only.\nW. G. Stewart for the respondent. There was no negligence on the part of the respondent or alternately, if there was, then the damages were such as could not reasonably have been contemplated and are such that the respondent is not liable at law. It is the obligation of the appellant to prove its case as required by the rules of law relating to the particular type of action. The true test is 11 whether on the evidence negligence may be reasonably inferred and (2) whether, assuming it may reasonably be inferred, it is in fact inferred. Metropolitan Ry. v. Jackson (1). The trial judge makes no finding on negligence nor does the Appeal Court so far as \"failure\" to take reasonable precautions is concerned. The appellant has not proved his case either by direct facts or reasonable inference. A Plaintiff cannot succeed if the case is to be decided by surmise or conjecture. Wakelin v. London & Southwestern Ry. Co. 12; Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Proctor 13; Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran 14. Negligence at law can be established if the facts proved and the inferences to be drawn from them are more consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant than with other causes. Ellor v. Selfridge & Co. Ltd. 15; McGowan v. Stott 16; Daniel v. Metropolitan Ry. 17. It is necessary for the Plaintiff to establish by evidence circumstances from which it may be fairly inferred that there is reasonable probability that the accident resulted from the want of some precaution which the defendant might and ought to have resorted to. If the plaintiff's evidence is equally consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant as with other causes, there is no evidence of negligence, and judgment cannot be given against the defendant. In McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co. 18 the jury expressly found negligence in the defendant. While the exact cause of the accident was not proved, yet it was established clearly that the injured person was operating a machine defective beyond doubt. The case cannot be cited as an authority here, because in the one case there was an express finding of negligence, in the other an express finding of no negligence.\nThe damages are too remote. Monarch Steamship Co. v. A\/B Karlshams Oljefabriker 19; Donoghue v. Steevenson 20; Longhurst v. Metropolitan Water Board 21.\nOn the evidence it is not proper to find negligence in the respondent and the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal should be confirmed in the particular finding. Peters v. Prince of Wales Theater (Birmingham) Ltd. 22; Duncan v. Campbell Laird & Co. 23.\nThe modern authority on \"nuisance\", particularly as the same applies to water or water works is to be found in Longhurst v. Metropolitan Water Board (supra). The case deals with a public authority having statutory power but the decision of the House of Lords and particularly that of Lord Porter at page 839, who quotes with approval the principle enunciated by Rowlatt J. as follows: \"A person is liable for nuisance constituted by the state of his property; (1) if he causes it; (2) if by the neglect of some duty he allowed it to arise; and (3) if, when it has arisen without his own act or default, he omits to remedy it within a reasonable time after he did or ought to have become aware of it.\" In Noble v. Harrison 24 from which the above quotation was taken, the action failed because no such knowledge was established. The general difference between the position of a statutory authority acting in the course of its duty and that of a private individual is to be found in Green v. Chelsea Waterworks 25. An example of negligence in failing to remedy a danger caused in the carrying out of authorized work, but was or should have been known to the defendants and was not remedied, is to be found in Pope v. Fraser & Southern Rolling & Wire Mills Ltd. 26. It is suggested by Lord Porter, however, that \"had the danger been unknown to the defendants and had they no reasonable ground for suspecting it, the result would have been different.\"\nIn the case of Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan 27 it is apparent that the respondents were held liable \"because with knowledge or means of knowledge, they suffered the nuisance to continue without taking reasonably prompt and efficient means for its abatement.\" At page 354 Viscount Maugham states \"I will begin by saying that, in my opinion the principle laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher does not apply to the present case. That principle relates only to cases where there has been some special use of property bringing with it increased danger to others, and does not extend to damage caused to adjoining owners as the result of the ordinary use of the land.\" See also Lord Atkin at 361 and Lord Wright at 365-66. The case was decided on the principle that the party held responsible either knew or ought to have known. The general principles of the law are clearly stated and must, it is submitted, be resolved in favour of the respondent here.\nCharing Cross v. London Hydraulic Power Co. 28 and Midwood v. Manchester Corporation 29 are both distinguishable. In the first there was a \"non-natural user\" of water, in the second, an obvious dangerous thing, namely electricity was used in large quantities, the mere escape of which created a nuisance without proof of negligence.\nDamage caused by the ordinary domestic use of gas, water and electricity is never actionable except on proof of negligence. Tilley v. Stevenson 30.\nThe rule in Rylands v. Fletcher as pointed out by Lord Simon in Read v. Lyons 31 must be confined within the strict limits laid down by the House of Lords, the conditions, then declared to be necessary for the existence of absolute liability, should be strictly observed.\nThere can be no doubt that in the case at Bar there was no \"non-natural user.\" Rickards v. Lothian 32; Peters v. Prince of Wales Theater 33. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Rand, J. was delivered by:\nRand J.:\u2014The facts in this appeal are these. The claim is for flooding a basement and damaging goods in it. The respondent is the owner of three adjoining buildings in the City of Moncton, running east and west, and having two inside common walls. From west to east, the first was formerly used by a creamery, but had been purchased by the respondent and at the time was undergoing alterations; the next was occupied by a plumbing company and a hardware company respectively; and the third by the appellant, dealing in paints and wall papers. There was a stone basement wall between the first and second; the basements of the plumbing and hardware companies were separated by a wooden partition wall; and between the second and third a stone wall with two door openings in it. The drainage of the second and third led to a trap outlet in the southeast corner of the latter. Into the first a water service entered about two feet above the basement floor through a 4\" pipe from a 12\" street main. The end of the pipe just inside the wall was enlarged into what is known as a bell. This pipe had in 1937 been reduced to 2\" by inserting into the bell, like an inverted drinking glass, an iron reducing plug, 4\" in diameter and 5 or 6 inches in length, the closed end of which was \u00bd\" thick. It was held in place in the bell by a packing of oakum and lead. The closed end was tapped to a diameter of 2\" and threaded, and a 2\" pipe introduced. This pipe led to a meter and from the meter to the pipe system of the creamery. The 4\" pipe was controlled by a valve at the street curb. This was the structural condition on December 17, 1947 when the creamery company vacated the premises, and the city turned off the water at the curb and removed the meter.\nOn January 1st the respondent took possession and commenced the work of alteration. On January 31st, at its request, the water was turned on. Some time during the month, a \u00bd\" tap was set in the 2\" pipe, for drinking purposes.\nIn the course of the work, the basement floor became littered with material that probably stopped up a 4\" drainage trap. The ground floor windows were without glass and boarded up, and at least one window in the basement was broken or open. During the day, portable oil stoves furnished the only heat. The temperature on March 1st ranged from 19\u00b0 above zero at 3:30 p.m. to 9\u00b0 below zero at midnight.\nBetween 10:15 and 11:00 p.m. of that day, the cellar was discovered full of water and overflowing into the street. In the course of the next half hour or so, the valve at the curb was closed and Edgar LeBlanc, president of both the respondent and the plumbing company, notified. LeBlanc thought nothing could then be done and, as he says, \"went back to bed\". At that time there was approximately seven feet of water in the basement.\nAbout 8:00 o'clock in the morning, LeBlanc found the adjoining basements to have from 12\" to 18\" of water in them. In the first there remained about 4' depth of the water which some time later in the day was pumped out.\nIt was then discovered that the reducing plug had been dislodged from the bell. These plugs are frequently forced out by water pressure and it was said to be difficult to remove them intact otherwise. Several suggestions seem plausible as contributory factors to the separation. Any considerable force on the 2\" pipe to which the plug was annexed and which projected about 2' from the wall, such as a blow or wrench, would tend to loosen the plug in the packing; work done on the pipe as in the removal of the meter or the installation of the tap would have that tendency; or the pipe might have been struck by falling debris. It was sought to show that the water in the 4\" pipe might have frozen and expanded the bell, thus loosening the packing, but I find no real evidence that in the circumstance that could possibly have taken place. But undoubtedly a slight weakening or loosening of the plug in the packing would cause it to yield to the water.\nThe only evidence of the time of the occurrence is the recordings of pressure in the city pumping station, and they indicate a sudden drop around 5:30 o'clock p.m. As the workmen left between 4:30 and 5:00, this would seem to put it shortly after the work for the day stopped. There might, at that time, be minor pressure increases from the closing down of places of business. It is undisputed that the water made its way through the foundation under the first wall and into the adjoining basement, from which it passed into that of the appellant. Richards C.J. takes the word \"foundation\" to mean wall but LeBlanc's assent to the question: \"You think it seeped through the foundation. That would be the foundation where the wall meets with the basement\"? rules that out. On the floor, the appellant had stored paints, wall papers and other supplies, which were damaged.\nThe claim is put on three grounds: negligence, nuisance, and the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher 34.\nThe first must depend upon the conclusion of fact that the dislodgment could occur only through some failure on the part of the respondent's employees. Possibly that was the case, but the main work was being done by a contractor. No workman was called. Negligence in the contractor's work would be collateral as there was no apparent danger to the appellant involved in what was undertaken. In these uncertain circumstances I find no ground on which to invoke either the presumption of res ipse loquitur or its equivalent as a warranted inference from the proof, and the case for negligence is not made out.\nThe remaining grounds raise the question of a stricter liability. In the conception of negligence, general conflicting interests are accommodated on the standard of the range of foreseeable risks which would influence the conduct of the ordinary man acting reasonably: that is a rule that permeates all human relations; and as Lord MacMillan in Read v. Lyons 35, says:\u2014\nThe process of evolution has been from the principle that every man acts at his peril and is liable for all the consequences of his acts to the principle that a man's freedom of action is subject only to the obligation not to infringe any duty of care which he owes to another.\nOutside of that body lie the exceptional situations.\nIn Rylands the illustrations given by Blackburn J. included the following examples of nuisance:\u2014\n\"The mine flooded from his neighbour's user\", \"the cellar invaded by the filth of his neighbour's privy,\" \"whose habitation is made unhealthy by the fumes of noisome vapours of his neighbour's alkali works\". In Read v. Lyons, supra, at p. 474 Lord Simon, in remarking on these illustrations says:\u2014\nThe classic judgment of Blackburn, J. besides deciding the issue before the court and laying down the principle of duty between neighbouring occupiers of land on which the decision was based, sought to group under a single and wider proposition other instances in which liability is independent of negligence, such, for example, as liability for the bite of a defendant's monkey: May v. Burdett 36. See also the case of a bear on a chain on the defendant's premises: Besozzi v. Harris 37. There are instances, no doubt, in our law in which liability for damage may be established apart from proof of negligence, but it appears to me logically unnecessary and historically incorrect to refer to all these instances as deduced from one common principle.\nViscount Maugham L.C. in Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan 38, speaks of the \"special\" use called for by the rule.\nIn Charing Cross v. London Hydraulic 39, following Midwood v. Manchester 40, a high pressure water main in a street was in question. Through various causes it had become unsupported; it broke and a nearby electric main of the plaintiff was damaged. The Court of Appeal, consisting of Lord Sumner, Kennedy L.J. and Bray J. held the company liable equally for a nuisance and under the rule. Scrutton J. at the trial had viewed it as an ordinary use of roads to carry mains of water, gas and electricity, but he felt bound by Midwood v. Manchester. Lord Sumner, at p. 1355, says:\u2014\nIt might be sufficient to dispose of this case to say that it is indistinguishable from Midwood & Co. v. Manchester Corporation (supra) which is binding on this Court, but, lest there should be any misunderstanding, I think it right to express my opinion that this case is also indistinguishable from Rylands v. Fletcher.\nand the reasons of Kennedy L.J. and Bray J. are to the same effect.\nIn the case at bar, there is, in some respects, a similar overlapping. The first question is whether the maintenance of a 4\" water pipe, a capacity much greater than the 1\u00bc\" intended to be used by the respondent, so close to a 12\" main, held in check by the plug liable to be forced out by pressure, with an attached length of pipe exposed to being knocked about, was an ordinary or virtually necessary use of the basement or one which must be treated as special? However \"natural\" it might have been to the creamery it was not so to the requirements of the respondent: it was equally exceptional in the general use of water; and it created undoubtedly a substantial addition to the ordinary risks to neighbouring premises.\nIn Blake v. Woolf 41, Wright J. held the maintenance for household purposes of a water cistern on premises occupied by several tenants to be an ordinary and reasonable user of the premises as between the occupants. This case was approved in Richards v. Lothian 42. There the water from a lavatory on the top floor of a building overflowed through the tap which had been turned on full and the waste pipe plugged by a third person. Lord Moulton, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nIt is not every use to which land is put that brings into play that principle (i.e. the rule in Fletcher v. Rylands). It must be some special use bringing with it increased danger to others and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community.\nThe benefit of the community must here be intended as direct or immediate, such as health, and not what might arise remotely from industry.\nIn Musgrove v. Pandelis 43, the keeping of a motor car in a garage with gasoline in the tank was held, on appeal, to be a dangerous agency within the rule from which liability arose for the destruction of the overhead premises through a fire from an unexplained cause in the starting of the engine. In Mulholland v. Baker 44, Asquith J. (now Lord Asquith) applied the same principle to the keeping of a drum containing twenty gallons of paraffin which was exploded by a fire spreading from a burning paper set to drive a rat out of a drain pipe. In Collingwood v. Home Stores Limited 45, the Court of Appeal held a fire caused by defective wiring without negligence not to be within the rule. Lord Wright, referring to the Midwood and Charing Cross decisions, supra, says:\u2014\nBut in all these cases there was nothing comparable to the ordinary domestic installation of electric wiring for the ordinary comfort and convenience of life. In all these cases these dangerous things were being handled in bulk and in large quantities; * * * These * * * seem to me to be a lot different in principle and in result from the case of the ordinary domestic pipes for gas or water or for wiring electricity, * * * *\nThese enhanced risks are prima facie risks of the persons creating them and there is nothing before us to take the case outside the scope of the rule. This liability is not affected by the fact that the dislodgment may have been due to the negligence of the contractor. In thus placing upon the owner the risk of harm to innocent neighbours resulting from such a special feature, the ancient maxim, imprecise and fallacious however it may be, remains the presumptive guide: sic uti suo ut non laedat alienum.\nRichards C.J. quotes a passage from Lord MacMillan's speech in Read v. Lyons, supra:\u2014\nI have already pointed out that nothing escaped from the defendants' premises, and, were it necessary to decide the point, I should hesitate to hold that in these days and in an industrial community it was a non-natural use of land to build a factory on it and conduct there the manufacture of explosives. I could conceive it being said that to carry on the manufacture of explosives in a crowded urban area was evidence of negligence, but there is no such case here and I offer no opinion on the point.\nBut in Rainham Chemical Works Limited v. Belvedere Fish Company 46, the House of Lords held the bringing of nitrate of soda and dinitrophenol together for the purposes of making munitions to be a danger, though unknown to the owners, which rendered them liable for an explosion which resulted from fire. Whether Rainham, Sussex, is a \"crowded suburban area\" was not considered. In any event, it does not appear that the buildings here are in an industrial area.\nBut taking the situation only from the moment when the basement had filled and the respondent notified and accepting the view that the negligence of the contractor could not bring the condition within the rule, did a duty to take reasonable action against the danger then arise, a duty attaching to a state of nuisance not the act of the owner? For at least nine hours the water was left by LeBlanc to work whatever mischief it might. We know that water permeates the soil; LeBlanc knew that surface water had seeped into the appellant's basement through or under the rear foundation wall: and that it will do so generally seems to me to be a matter of common knowledge. Ermen, a plumber, in his evidence, takes that fact for granted although he would not speculate on its rate of progress.\nIn the Appeal Division, Richards C.J., Harrison J. concurring, considered that LeBlanc could not reasonably be expected to know that a nuisance had been created: this means that he was not chargeable with liability in relation to it and might, short of adoption, with impunity, have allowed it to remain or to seep out indefinitely so long as damaging results remained unknown.\nThe question is not whether he should have known that a nuisance had been created but whether he should have sensed a real danger of a nuisance. Essential facts were unknown: LeBlanc does not suggest that he had yet become acquainted with the condition of the floor in any part of the basement, much less that next the common wall. Risk connotes uncertain action arising from concealed or unknown factors against which experience has taught us to be on guard. There were such factors here and the condition presented to LeBlanc was one which should have signalled a dangerous possibility. A duty to act arose and, to be effective at all, it called for prompt measures.\nIt would have entailed some inconvenience to investigate the adjoining premises that night, but even that was unnecessary to notification. LeBlanc knew that if water reached the adjoining basement the way was open to the others, and as a minimum of precaution he should have apprised the appellant: Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan (supra); Pope v. Fraser 47; Northwestern Utilities v. London Guarantee Company 48. At that time the goods that were damaged could easily and quickly have been removed from the lower levels of the basement: and it is a fair inference from the evidence that the water reached there in damaging quantity after LeBlanc learned what had happened.\nMr. Stewart argued that what is assumed to have been \u00e0 negligently clogged trap and drain pipe in the appellant's basement was an answer to the claim. But that objection, I think, misconceives the situation. The trap and outlet were for the benefit of the appellant for ordinary drainage purposes as were the trap and outlet in the respondent's basement: and even assuming the intermediate tenants to be entitled to drain through the appellant's premises, that does not give rise to a duty toward the respondent to protect it against the consequences of its own culpable action.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs throughout; as the trial judge did not find the amount of damages, the case should be referred back to him to do so, with liberty to either party to adduce further evidence. The costs of the latter, however, should be in the discretion of the trial judge.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellant, engaged in the selling of wallpaper and paint on premises leased from the respondent, claims damages for loss suffered when, as it alleges, due to the respondent's negligence, a four-inch water pipe froze, forcing out a plug, permitting water to flow in great quantities into the appellant's premises and injuring its stock. The appellant's action was dismissed at trial and that judgment was affirmed in the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Mr. Justice Hughes dissenting.\nThe premises in question, though not constructed as one building, are now owned by the respondent and throughout this litigation have been treated as one, three-story, brick building, with basement, on Main Street in the City of Moncton. It is divided into four parts and, so far as material in this litigation, the appellant occupies the ground floor and basement of the most easterly part; the next is occupied by the Eastern Hardware Limited and the third by the Moncton Plumbing & Supply Company Limited.\nLeBlanc is president of both the respondent and the Moncton Plumbing & Supply Company Limited.\nThe most westerly part of the premises had been vacant since December 19, 1947, and respondent, as owner, had, since some time in January, 1948, been effecting renovations in preparation for another tenant. These renovations included the removal of the entire front and part of the main and second floors of the most westerly portion of the building. These were commenced in January and, prior to March 2, 1948, when the water escaped causing the damage here claimed, the evidence suggests the front was well advanced, \"the ground floor was all renewed\" and the men were working upon the ceilings and other floors. On the day in question the men were working above the basement and left the premises about 5:00 p.m. In this vacant part there was no heat except that provided by portable oil heaters, which the men carried about as their work required. Once they left there was no heat upon these premises and it is conceded that the temperature inside this building would be substantially the same as that out of doors.\nThe water from the city system entered this westerly part through a four-inch pipe, 5 or 6 feet below street level and about 1\u00bd to 2 feet above the basement floor. The end of this four-inch pipe in the building was described as bell-shaped, into which a plug was inserted from 4 to 6 inches long with the outer end of solid iron about one-half inch thick. It was held in position or \"lodged there with oakum and lead and corked in.\" It was tapped, in order to reduce the flow from 4 inches to 2 inches, and on the end of the two-inch pipe a tap was placed.\nAfter the men left, and probably about 5:30 p.m., as determined by the change in pressure at the city pumping station, this plug came out of the four-inch pipe, with the result that the water poured into the basement and continued to do so until about 10:30 at night, when a policeman discovered water flowing from that part of the building into the street. He communicated with Coleman, a service man in the Water and Light Department of the City of Moncton, who proceeded to the premises where he found \"water flowing at quite a rate on Main Street,\" which came out of this westerly part through a cellar window. He immediately telephoned LeBlanc, describing the condition as he found it and stating that he would turn off the water at the city main. A few minutes later he telephoned that he had, in fact, turned off the water. In the course of these conversations he asked LeBlanc to come down, to which the latter replied that \"there was not much he could do at that time of the night, he didn't have the key.\" Neither did Mr. LeBlanc, nor anyone else, communicate with the other tenants, who, therefore, knew nothing of the presence of the water until the next morning.\nThe basement into which the water flowed has a wall between it and the next tenant, the Moncton Plumbing & Supply Company Limited. This wall, about 2 feet in thickness, extends from the basement floor to the ceiling. LeBlanc described it as \"a stone wall with mortar in the joints and it looks to be a very well built wall.\" Upon the westerly side it has a concrete face. Between the Moncton Plumbing & Supply Company Limited and the next tenant, Eastern Hardware Limited, is a wooden partition, and that between the Eastern Hardware Limited and respondent is again a stone wall, 2 feet in thickness, with mortar in the joints, but with two wooden doors permitting passage through it. The water flowed out of the four-inch pipe and filled the basement until it flowed out of the window. It also seeped through the stone and mortar wall with the concrete face and, once through that, it passed through the wooden partition and the doors of the other stone wall into the premises of the appellant. Apart from turning the water off at the city main, nothing was done that night. LeBlanc arrived at the building about 8:00 o'clock the next morning. He says he then found about 4 feet of water in that part of the basement into which the water flowed from the pipe, about a foot in the part occupied by the Moncton Plumbing & Supply Company Limited and a foot to a foot and a half in that portion occupied by the appellant. Others deposed to larger quantities in the respective parts, but it is not questioned but that sufficient water entered the appellant's premises to do the damage here claimed.\nThe tenants moved out of the most westerly part and the water was turned off at the city main on December 19, 1947. It was turned on again on January 28, 1948, and remained so until March 1, 1948. The plug at the end of the four-inch pipe was placed there in 1937, according to the usual and accepted practice. In the intervening period it served its purpose without any suggestion of weakness or defect. That the water from this four-inch pipe caused the damage is conceded. The appellant claims that the plug was forced out when the water in the pipe froze because the respondent had \"failed in sub-zero weather to heat the premises or to take reasonable or any precautions to avoid such freezing.\" Bingham, the Water Department foreman and Plumbing Inspector for the City of Moncton, stated that it might have been forced out by frost or because of old age, defective joint, or pressure. The plug itself was not produced. LeBlanc, himself a plumber, deposed that he had this plug in his \"possession for a long time and the men dismantled it,\" and suggested it may have been sold for junk. It is fair to assume that, if the condition of the plug had been such as to support a conclusion that it came out either because of old age or defective joint, it would have been carefully preserved and evidence adduced in regard thereto. Not only was the plug not preserved, but no evidence was adduced to support either of these possible causes.\nLeBlanc, while he did not think it was forced out by frost, suggested, at his examination for discovery, that there must have been \"a high pressure of water in water main on Main Street to cause that reducer to burst.\" At the trial, however, he deposed that he had \"no idea\" what forced the plug out. The suggestion that pressure may have caused it appears to be conclusively answered by the evidence. At the pumping station the pressure varied from 51 to 58 pounds between 5:00 and 10:45 o'clock that night. On Main Street the pressure would be approximately 15 pounds less. The evidence also establishes that the average pressure at the pumping station is some 60 to 65 pounds and that at this period they were conserving water and had reduced the pressure to the point where they often received complaints. Upon this evidence there is not only no support for, but it, in effect, refutes the possibility of the water pressure expelling this plug.\nBingham thought that the frost was the most likely cause. Keiver, the engineer at the city pumping station, deposed that on March 1 the temperature at 8:00 a.m. was 2 degrees below zero; 12:00 noon 11 degrees above zero; 3:20 p.m. 19 degrees above zero; 12:00 midnight 9 degrees below zero. He was of the opinion that the temperatures in this basement were such that the pipes might have frozen at any time between 3:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight.\nThe accepted method of removing these plugs is by a blow torch. They may also be expelled by great pressure, but an attempt to do so by pounding or other force results in a breaking of the plug. In the course of the trial one witness was asked if the two-inch pipe \"were hit with lumber, people or other things,\" would it break the pipe or dislodge the plug. His reply was that it would dislodge the plug before breaking the pipe. Such an opinion, apart from evidence that on or about the day in question such was a reasonable probability, is not sufficient to offset the evidence in this record, as found by all the learned judges in the Appeal Division, that the plug was expelled by frost.\nWhile the water was turned on on January 28 and provided a place for the men to obtain drinking water, there is no evidence that it was so used on or about the day in question, or, if so, when. In fact there is no evidence that the workmen or anyone else was in this basement on or about the day in question.\nLeBlanc, himself a plumber, expressed the opinion that if a building were unoccupied and unheated during the winter the water should be turned off at the city main and the tap in the cellar opened in order to let the water in the pipe drain out. These premises, from the point of view of temperature, were, in effect, unoccupied and unheated. If it was desirable to have water available from this tap for the workmen, it would seem, having regard to probable temperatures, but ordinary prudence to provide for the turning off of the water, or some other reasonable precautions, to prevent the freezing thereof and consequent damage.\nRespondent submits that this evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion of negligence and that any statement that the freezing of the pipes caused the expulsion of the plug was but a surmise or a conjecture. The respondent cited, in support of his contention, certain cases, including The Montreal Rolling Mills Company v. Corcoran 49, where Wilson, an experienced engineer, had been in charge of the engine and machinery in the appel- lant's mill for about two years. One day the employees of the mill heard a strange noise and, upon rushing to the engine room, \"the engine and machinery were found running in perfect order, but poor Wilson was dead, his body being scattered around the room, frightfully mutilated.\" Wilson had been alone. Everything was found in order and there were no facts from which a conclusion or inference might be drawn as to what had taken place to cause this unfortunate death.\nThe case at bar, however, is quite distinguishable upon its facts. Certain causes were here suggested, but, upon the evidence, all of these were eliminated except frost. On the night in question there was sufficient frost, having regard to the state of the building, to cause just what happened and the evidence justifies the conclusion that the plug was forced out because of the freezing of the water. It is, therefore, a case more like that of McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company 50, where a young man employed at the respondent's works was injured when an explosion originated in an automatic machine at which the injured boy was employed. The explosion was instantaneous and the jury found it was due to negligence on the part of the company to supply suitable machinery and to take proper precautions to prevent an explosion. Their Lordships of the Privy Council pointed out that, upon the evidence, cartridges were now and then presented in a wrong posture, which would prevent the machine functioning properly, and then stated at p. 76:\nIt seems to be not an unreasonable inference from the facts proved that in one of these blows that failed a percussion cap was ignited and so caused the explosion. There was no other reasonable explanation of the mishap when once it was established to the satisfaction of the jury that the injury was not owing to any negligence or carelessness on the part of the operator. The wonder really is, not that the explosion happened as and when it did, but that things went on so long without an explosion.\nThough the frost was sufficient to cause the freezing of the pipes, it is not suggested it was unusual at that time of the year in the City of Moncton. Indeed, the wonder is that these pipes had not frozen in the period intervening since January 28, 1948. The evidence makes it clear that the expansion consequent upon the freezing of this water would force the plug out. The evidence, in my opinion, points directly to the low temperature in the building as the cause of the water freezing and forcing the plug out of the pipe. This was a possibility that, in the circumstances, would have been foreseen by a reasonable man, who would have taken steps to provide against it and, therefore, failure to take such precautions constitutes negligence on the part of the respondent.\nThe root of this liability is negligence, and what is negligence depends on the facts with which you have to deal. If the possibility of the danger emerging is reasonably apparent, then to take no precautions is negligence; but if the possibility of danger emerging is only a mere possibility which would never occur to the mind of a reasonable man, then there is no negligence in not having taken extraordinary precautions.\" Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington 51.\nI am, therefore, in agreement with the conclusions arrived at by the learned judges in the Appellate Court that the plug was forced out by the freezing of the pipes and that the respondent was negligent in not taking proper precautions to prevent such an occurrence.\nThe majority of the learned judges in the Appeal Division were, however, of the opinion that the respondent was not liable because\nLeBlanc had reasonable ground for believing that the water would not escape through that wall into the adjoining premises.\nLeBlanc himself does not depose that he entertained such a belief. Indeed, when asked if he had, in his 25 years' experience, \"ever known water to seep through two foot stone and concrete wall,\" he went no further than to reply: \"Well, I never had much experience in that, but I was surprised when it did.\" He did not suggest that at any time he made a careful examination of that wall and contented himself with the statement already quoted: \"a stone wall with mortar in the joints and it looks to be a very well built wall.\"\nThe evidence does not disclose the age of this building more than that it had been occupied by the Farmers' Co-Operative Creamery Company since prior to 1922. There is no evidence, apart from the cement facing already mentioned being placed on the western side of this wall, that it had been repaired or altered since the building was constructed. A conclusion is justified, however, that it was a rather large basement with a sufficient quantity of water therein, when LeBlanc was communicated with, to exert a substantial pressure. LeBlanc knew the drain or outlet for water in that basement was covered with 18 inches of concrete and sand and, therefore, that it would either not function or, if so, only at a reduced capacity. Further, LeBlanc knew that in 1947 water had seeped through the outside wall in that part of the building occupied by the appellant and had, in fact, warned them, because of this, to keep the drain clear.\nWater in such a volume exercises very great pressure and will find the smallest passages of escape and, wherever possible, will wear away the sides of those small passages and increase the flow. This is common knowledge and more particularly would be known to a plumber in the position of LeBlanc.\nWith the greatest possible respect for those learned judges who hold a contrary opinion, I think the finding that LeBlanc had reasonable ground for believing that the water would not escape through that wall into the adjoining premises cannot be supported. It rather seems that a reasonable man, having regard to the location of the wall and the fact that it had been there for at least 25 years, and probably a much longer time, would have appreciated the possibility of such cracks, or other openings, having developed in the wall as to make seepage a probability. Moreover, the quantity of water there impounded to permit of it flowing through the window into the street would indicate a very substantial force being exerted upon that wall, which, upon the evidence, it was never constructed to withstand.\nThe foregoing disposes of this appeal. It does, however, appear desirable to point out that event if, as found by the majority of the learned judges in the Appeal Division, LeBlanc had reasonable grounds for believing that the water would not seep through the wall and, therefore, the damage, as claimed, was not foreseeable to a reasonable man, nevertheless the damage might be recovered. While the point has not been finally determined, there is authority that foreseeability, while relevant in deciding the issue of negligence, is not relevant in determining what damage may be recovered arising out of, or consequent upon, that negligence.\nThe appellant also based its claim upon nuisance and the principles underlying Rylands v. Fletcher 52. In view, however, of the conclusions arrived at, it is unnecessary to discuss these.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment entered that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent such damages as may be fixed by the trial judge. The case should be sent back to him for that purpose with leave to both parties to call such further evidence as they may be advised. The costs of this reference should be left to the discretion of the trial judge.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014In so far as the appellant's claim is based upon negligence in permitting the escape of the water into the cellar of the premises formerly occupied by the Farmers' Co-Operative Creamery Company, the case pleaded is that in consequence of the failure of the respondent to heat the premises the water pipe burst and thereafter, due to the drainage from the cellar being inadequate, the water escaped into the premises of the appellant causing damage.\nThere is no evidence that the water pipe burst, the only evidence as to the means by which the water escaped being that of Leblanc, president of the respondent company, that the plug or sleeve inserted into the four-inch water pipe inside the cellar by the former tenant had been forced out in some manner. Leblanc had been examined for discovery in advance of the trial and then said that the plug was in the respondent's possession if the other side wanted it as an exhibit but, unfortunately, it was not produced or identified and thereafter it had apparently been dismantled for junk and was not available at the trial. In view of what took place at the examination for discovery, I think no inference unfavourable to the respondent is to be drawn from the fact that the plug, an examination of which might have indicated how it had been forced from the four-inch pipe, was not produced. I agree with the learned trial judge that there were no facts proven from which he could properly draw any inference as to the manner in which the plug was dislodged. It had been inserted into the four-inch water pipe some years previously at the instance of the Farmers' Co-Operative Creamery Company, being secured by molten lead and oakum in accordance with what was shown to be standard practice. It was the appellant's contention that the water freezing had forced out the plug. Presumably (though this is not made clear) this means freezing in the four-inch pipe since freezing in the two-inch pipe could not dislodge the plug. There was no direct evidence of any freezing in either pipe and it was the undisputed evidence that more than four weeks prior to the date the water escaped, the water, which had been shut off at the main in the street, was turned on and that during the intervening period the employees of the contractor employed by the respondent company to make extensive alterations to the building had drawn water every day for drinking purposes from the tap in the two-inch pipe screwed in to the base of the plug. The water apparently escaped into the cellar at some time on March 1, 1948, and evidence was given that on that day, in the very early morning, the temperature had been 4 degrees below zero, that at 8.00 a.m. it was 2 below, at noon 11 above zero and at 3.30 p.m. 19 above zero, which was the highest temperature of the day. Later that day the temperature dropped again and it was 9 below at midnight. From the fact that, as shown by the plaintiff's witness Keiver, the engineer in charge of the city pumping station, the water pressure dropped suddenly between 4.15 and 5.45 p.m. it might properly be inferred that it was at about this time the plug became detached or was forced from the pipe and the water commenced to escape.\nThe evidence tendered by the appellant in an endeavour to prove that freezing was responsible for the plug being dislodged was that of Keiver and Wesley Bingham, the Water Department foreman and plumbing inspector for the City of Moncton. The former, a stationary engineer, said that if there was no fire in the building it took very little frost to freeze a pipe and that, assuming there was no heat in the building, the pipes would have been liable to freeze on March 1st. Bingham, who had been in the city's employ for over 30 years, said that frost was the most common factor in causing breaks and leaks in water pipes. While he had not in giving evidence in chief hazarded the opinion that the plug had been forced out by the water in the pipe freezing, on redirect examination, in answer to a leading question asked by counsel for the appellant, he said that if the water in the pipe (without specifying whether he meant the four-inch or the two-inch pipe) froze solid enough, the expansion would be sufficient to loosen the plug which would be forced out and that this was one of the things he suggested might have happened in this case. LeBlanc, for the respondent, a plumber with 25 years' experience, said that he had never heard of a four-inch plug being dislodged by frost. His company had purchased the building and taken possession on January 1, 1948, and the contractor employed in renovating the building had used portable oil heaters on the ground floor of the premises to keep them sufficiently warm for the workmen to carry on the work. It was on January 28th that the water was turned on and while no evidence was given as to the temperatures which had prevailed in Moncton between that date and March 1st, LeBlanc said that January and February were generally the coldest months of the year, and the learned trial judge might properly infer, as he did, that on many occasions during this period the temperature had been below freezing. There had been, according to LeBlanc, no trouble with freezing in the building during this period. This being the state of the record, Anglin J. was, in my opinion, right in declining to draw the inference that frost had caused the plug to be dislodged. There were, as was indicated in the evidence, other possible causes such as the plug being struck a heavy blow in the course of the work of reconstruction being carried on in the building or by reason of some latent weakness or defect in the connection, but whether it was one of these or some other cause appears to me to be simply a matter of conjecture.\nAs to the claim that there was negligence on the part of the respondent in failing to provide the cellar with drains adequate to carry off the volume of water which would escape from the four-inch pipe if the plug were dislodged, or alternatively in seeing that the existing drain should be kept clear, I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge. It is clear upon the evidence that even had the existing drain been kept clear of debris, it could not have carried off promptly the volume of water which would escape if the plug were dislodged. I am further of the opinion that there was no duty resting upon the respondent as the owner of the building to provide a drain of such size as to immediately carry off water admitted into the basement without fault on its part.\nWhile the appellant had further pleaded that after the escaping water had filled the cellar of the respondent's premises, to its knowledge no steps had been taken to prevent it escaping into the premises occupied by the appellant, this point does not appear to have been considered by Anglin J. On appeal, Richards C.J., with whom Harrison J. agreed, was of the opinion that in view of the nature of the existing stone wall between the appellant's cellar and the premises lying to the east, a reasonable person would assume (as LeBlanc said that he did in fact assume) that the water would not escape during the night and cause damage. I respectfully agree with the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice that the failure of the respondent to take steps to rid the basement of the water until the following morning at 8 o'clock was not actionable negligence.\nThere are two branches of the claim in so far as it is based upon nuisance. Contending that the cellar filled with water was in law a nuisance, it is said firstly that it was created through the negligence of the respondent in permitting the escape of water from the four-inch pipe, and secondly that even if the escape of the water from the pipe was not due to the respondent's negligence, the latter is liable on the ground that after LeBlanc learned that the cellar had become filled with water he took no immediate steps to abate the nuisance. For the reasons which I have stated, I am of the opinion that the presence of the water in the basement was not due to the negligence of the respondent, but of course negligence is not a necessary condition of a claim for nuisance. In Noble v. Harrison 53, Rowlatt J. said that a person is liable for a nuisance constituted by the state of his property: (1) if he causes it; (2) if by the neglect of some duty he allowed it to arise; and (3) if: when it has arisen without his own act or default, he omits to remedy it within a reasonable time after he did or ought to have become aware of it. In Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan 54, Viscount Maugham approved the following statement of the law as to the liability for the continuation of a nuisance, taken from the 5th edition of Salmond on Torts: (p. 260)\nWhen a nuisance has been created by the act of a trespasser, or otherwise without the act, authority, or permission of the occupier, the occupier is not responsible for that nuisance unless, with knowledge or means of knowledge of its existence, he suffers it to continue without taking reasonably prompt and efficient means for its abatement.\nLord Wright said (p. 904) that if the nuisance were due to a latent defect or the act of a trespasser or stranger, the occupier was not liable unless he did not without undue delay remedy it when he became aware of it, or with ordinary and reasonable care should have become aware of it. In my opinion, if it be assumed that the condition existing in the cellar of the respondent's premises at the time LeBlanc was notified in the late evening of March 1st constituted a nuisance, the condition not having been brought about by any voluntary or negligent act of the appellant his failure to take steps to abate it until 8 o'clock on the following morning was not undue delay imposing liability upon the respondent.\nThere remains the contention of the appellant that upon the application of the principle in Rylands v. Fletcher 55, the respondent is liable. In Blake v. Woolf 56, water had escaped from a cistern maintained on the defendant's premises causing damage. Wright J. stated that the general rule as laid down in Rylands' case is that prima facie a person occupying land has an absolute right not to have his premises invaded by injurious matter such as large quantities of water which his neighbour keeps upon his land, but that the general rule is qualified by some exceptions, one of which is that where a person is using his land in the ordinary way and damage happens to the adjoining property without any default or negligence on his part no liability attached to him. In Rickards v. Lothian 57, Lord Moulton, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, referring to the principle laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher, said that it is not every use to which land is put that brings that principle into play, but that it must be some special use bringing with it increased danger to others and not merely the ordinary use of the land. Lord Moulton further adopted a passage from the judgment of Lord Robertson in Eastern and South African Telegraph Company v. Capetown Tramways Companies 58, where, referring to the principle, he said that it:\u2014\nsubjects to a high liability the owner who uses his property for purposes other than those which are natural.\nand expressly approved the passage from the judgment of Wright J. in Blake v. Woolf above referred to.\nSince the respondent in the present matter did not, of his own motion or by reason of his negligence, cause the basement to be filled with water or maintain it in that state for an unreasonable time after learning of the existence of the condition, the only possible ground for the application of the principle in Rylands\u2019 case appears to me to be that maintaining a four-inch pipe connecting with the principal water main of the city, capable of discharging a volume of water into the premises which would endanger the property of adjoining owners, involved liability upon this principle. Apart from the evidence of a witness, Coleman, a service man in the employ of the Water Department of the City of Moncton, that the flow of water from a four-inch pipe is more than the ordinary user, there was no suggestion that water for industrial purposes is not commonly brought upon such premises through the medium of such a pipe. In Rylands v. Fletcher, Cairns, L.C., after saying that the owners or occupiers of the close on which the reservoir was constructed might lawfully have used that close for any purpose for which it might in the ordinary course of the enjoyment of land be used, said that if, not stopping at the natural use of their close, they had desired to use it for any purpose which might be termed a non-natural use, they were doing so at their own peril. In Sedleigh-Denfield's case supra, Lord Maugham said that the principle in Rylands v. Fletcher related only to cases where there had been some special use of property bringing with it increased danger to others and that it did not extend to damage caused to adjoining owners, as the result of ordinary use of the land. I find no evidence in the present matter upon which to base a conclusion that to bring water for commercial use into business premises in a four-inch pipe is a non-natural, and not merely an ordinary, use of them. In my opinion, the principle does not apply to a case such as this.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Friel & Friel.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stewart & Savage.\n1 27 M.P.R. 159; [1951] 1 D.L.R. 265.\n2 (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330.\n3 (1856) 11 Ex.

The moneys to the credit of the account to be under the sole control of his wife to be used by her to maintain herself and the children, and educate the latter, as the wife in her sole discretion from time to time determined.\nThe appellant, widow of the testator, in 1944 received payment from the income account and the whole amount so paid her was assessed for income tax purposes as her income.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J. dissenting)\u2014That although the income in question was under the sole control of the appellant it was not hers absolutely but impressed with the obligation that it be devoted to the objects provided for as set out above. It could not therefore be said that the entire income was to be regarded as hers for the purpose of The Income War Tax Act. Singer v. Singer 52 Can. S.C.R. 447; 33 O.L.R. 602 at 611; Allen v. Furness 20 Ont. App. R. 34; In re Booth 2 Ch. 282. The wife being obligated to apply the income needed for the benefit not only of herself but also of the children, although her discretion was absolute, had an interest limited to that which she appropriated for herself, and the children became entitled to the remainder in the proportions she from time to time determined Re Coleman 39 Ch. D. 443.\nPer Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J. dissenting\u2014The decision in Singer v. Singer, supra prevented a holding that under the will either child was entitled to an aliquot part of the income. Even if that were not so, the income received by the appellant from the \"income account\" was her income. She was not a trustee and the mere fact that there was the responsibility upon her as such as described in the Singer case did not make the money any less her income than if she had received the income from \"B\" though she might be bound by bond to \"C\" to pay the latter a certain annual sum.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Graham J., Deputy Judgei 1, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from an assessment made in respect of the appellant's income for the year 1944.\nR. A. MacKimmie for the appellant. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in the following respects:\n1. In holding that the moneys received by the appellant from the income account of the Estate of Charles Bouck is her income within the meaning of The Income War Tax Act.\n2. In holding that the control over the moneys paid by the appellant was sufficiently absolute in its nature to constitute income as defined by s. 3 of the Act.\n3. In failing to apportion the moneys paid by the Trustee into the income account of the Estate as income received between the appellant and her two children or remitting the assessment back to the respondent for reassessment under s. 65 of the Act.\nThis appeal, briefly, is to determine whether the money earned by the Estate and placed by the Trustee in an income account and subject to the sole control of the appellant for the specific purposes provided by the Will is income in her hands or a fund which she administers for the actual benefit of herself and her two children.\nS. 3 of The Income War Tax Act defines income: \"Annual net profit or gain or gratuity\" are the defining words. S. 9 of the Act is the charging section: \"There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person \u2026\" Use of the word \"of\" denotes absolute ownership. Poe v. Seaborn 2. From the wording of ss. 3 and 9, it is submitted a fair definition of income within the meaning of the Act is \"annual net profit or gain or gratuity\" of the taxpayer. It is well established law that title to the bequest is determined from the intention of the testator as declared in his Will. Lewin on Trusts 14 Ed. 82-87. Hansbury's Modern Equity 5 Ed. 127. Comiskey v. Bowring-Hanbury 3. Clause 5 of the Will creates the fund in question. (Clause 5 and the other relevant clause of the will are fully set out in the reasons for judgment which follow). The significant features of clause 5 are :\n(i) The Trustee is directed to pay into an income account and not to pay any amount directly to the Appellant until both children have attained the age of 25 years;\n(ii) Use of the words \"under the sole control of my wife\" in para. 1 are words of administration and not of gift;\n(iii) The concluding sentence in para. 1 says: \"Any moneys from time to time to the credit of the said income account and not required by my wife for the purposes aforesaid may be taken by my Trustee and shall become part of the capital of the trust hereby created.\" This is clear evidence negativing intention of absolute gift. Note the use of the words \"for purpose aforesaid.\"\nClause 7 of the Will when read in conjunction with clause 5 gives further weight to the interpretation that the testator never intended an absolute gift to the appellant in clause 5 until she was to receive her share when both children attained the age of 25 years. The significant feature of clause 7 is the change of procedure now directing the Trustee to make payments directly to the appellant and no longer into the income account. Here are clear words of gift. The effect of the clause is that when the responsibilities and obligations to the children are satisfied on their attaining the age 25 years, the widow (Appellant) then receives one-half of the income earned by the estate. This is not only evidence negativing absolute gift to the appellant in clause 5 but is evidence of apportionment between the widow and children. It would be repugnant to the tenor of the whole Will to find the testator intended his widow to reduce her standard of living when the youngest children reached the age of 25 years.\nThe use of the words in clause 4 of the Will of \"each of my beneficiaries\" and \"but not including my wife in the event of her remarrying\" show the testator was thinking of his children as well as the appellant. If he was thinking only of his widow the clause is meaningless for clauses 5 and 7 provide for the widow's remarriage and the children attaining the age of 25 years. It is submitted that reading clauses 5 and 7 together and giving them their normal meaning, the money paid into the income account for the purposes named is not net gain, profit or gratuity of the appellant and is not income in her hands. It is obvious the testator intended by the choice of words and procedure in the first paragraph of clause 5 of the Will to make a different disposition of the money earned by the estate than he intended in making the gift under clause 7 of the Will.\nLooking at the Will in its entirety there is no intention expressed nor can one be implied to support the view that the testator intended the funds paid into the income account under clause 5 of the Will were to be given to the appellant absolutely. Had he had such an intention he could have used simple words to achieve such a purpose. Had he intended that his widow was only to use so much of the income produced by his estate for specific purposes he could not have used more effective wording or procedure to carry out such a purpose. Conversely had he intended an absolute gift to his widow of the income produced by the estate until his youngest child was 25 he would have said so in the clearest terms.\nDecided cases, apart from their general reasoning and explanation of rules of construction are of little assistance, for each Will must be treated in accordance with its own terms. The following cases are of general assistance.\u2013 Raikes v. Ward 4; In re Harris 5; Bibby v. Thompson 6 ; Crockett v. Crockett 7 ; Newill v. Newill 8 ; In re G 9 ; Booth v. Booth 10.\nH. W. Riley, Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent. The point in issue is\u2014Are the moneys received by the appellant pursuant to para. 5 of the Will income of the appellant within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act?\nThe onus is on the appellant to demolish the basic fact on which the taxation rests. Johnson v. Minister of National Revenue 11. The appellant has not kept accounts or made any accounting of the said sum of $3,797.26 and must fail for the reason she is unable to discharge the onus. By para. 5 of the Will there is an absolute gift to the appellant of the moneys the Trustee is directed to place to the credit of the Income Account coupled with the express desire of the testator that the appellant occupy with respect to the children after his decease the same position that he would have occupied; the manner of her so doing being expressly let in her sole discretion. The principles applicable to the construction of para. 5 is well put in Snell's Principles of Equity 21st Ed, 77; Comiskey v. Bowring-Hanbury 12.\nIn construing the Will as a whole the following points support the respondent's contention:\n(a) The fact that The Royal Trust Co. is appointed executor;\n(b) The general scheme of the Will is such that whenever a trust is created the same is expressly created in clear, apt and unequivocal language. In para. 5 thereof there is a complete absence of any words creating a trust expressly or impliedly.\n(c) Particular attention is drawn to the words \"under the sole control of my wife\" and \"in her sole discretion\". By para. 5 the moneys are placed under the sole control of the appellant to be expended in her sole discretion.\n(d) After placing the said moneys in her sole control the testator merely states what in his opinion is a reasonable method for the exercise of her sole control and in no sense creates a trust. The remaining words in the said para merely express the motive for the gift to the wife (the appellant). Hill v. Hill 13.\nThe Agreement as to Facts, para. 4 reads:\n\"4. That the said Appellant, Phyllis Bouck, has since the death of her husband the late Charles Bouck, occupied substantially the same position toward the said children as the late Charles Bouck occupied himself in his lifetime and in particular\u2026\" In this connection reference is made to Singer v. Singer 14 and the reasons of Anglin J., as he then was, at 458 and 460. He agrees with and quotes the reasons of Middleton J. as to the testator's intention. His judgment and the portion quoted by him from the judgment of Middleton J. is very much in point in view of para. 4 of the Agreement of Facts quoted supra. See also Lambe v. Eames 15 ; Thorp v. Owen 16 ; Manning v. Federal Commrs. of Taxation 17.\nThe cases cited in support of the appellant's contention have been discredited or over-ruled insofar as they conflict with the modern trend of authority as indicated by the case cited above and by In re Diggles 18. See also Hanbury, Modern Equity 2 Ed. 133. No injustice results from the respondent's view herein:\n(a) Irrespective of the terms of the Will the infant children were entitled to support from the appellant. Singer v. Singer, supra.\n(b) The testator undoubtedly had unbounded confidence in the appellant. His dominant intention was that during her lifetime she would occupy substantially the same position toward the children as he had. Singer v. Singer, supra. Para. 4, Statement of Facts.\n(c) Had the testator lived the income in his hands would no doubt have been taxable even though expended for the support of his wife arid children.\n(d) Had the appellant earned the income and expended it on the maintenance of herself and the children she would have been taxable, and because the income is unearned and used for their respective maintenance does not mean she is freed from income tax with respect to the whole or any portion of the said money.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellant, Mrs. Phyllis Bouck, was assessed to income tax for the year 1944 in an amount that she considers unauthorized by the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. She is the widow of Dr. Charles Bouck, who died at Calgary, July 19, 1944, leaving an estate of the aggregate value of $867,111.72 and net value of $845,940.72. Probate of Dr. Bouck's last will and two codicils thereto was duly granted to the executors named therein, viz., the Royal Trust Company and the appellant. While this is not a proceeding commenced in the Courts of Alberta to construe these documents, it is necessary to come to a conclusion as to the position thereunder of Mrs. Bouck in connection with the income of the estate since it is the assessment on that income, paid to her in the year 1944, that is in question.\nBy the testamentary documents, she was devised and bequeathed the testator's interest in their city and summer residences, together with such of their contents as already did not belong to her, and all personal property, including automobiles, and the sum of $5,000. While the Royal Trust Company was by the will appointed executor, the second codicil appointed the appellant an executrix to act with it. No such change was made in the designation of the Trust Company as trustee to which the testator devised and bequeathed all the rest and residue of his assets and property upon trust for realization and investment and to pay out of the capital of the trust during the lifetime of the appellant, and so long as she should occupy their family residence and summer residence, and so long as she should not remarry, all taxes that might be assessed against the two residences, and the premiums on all policies against loss or damage thereto by fire. By clause 4 of the will the trustee was to pay all taxes upon income assessed or levied in each year against each of the beneficiaries of the trust, but not including the appellant in the event of her remarrying. Then comes clause 5, the first paragraph of which is the important one:\u2014\n5. To pay to the credit of an \"income account\" all the net revenue of the trust hereby created (after payment of the cost of administration and the said income taxes) in every year until all of my children shall have attained the age of twenty-five (25) years. The moneys to the credit of the said account shall be under the sole control of my wife to be used by her to maintain a home for herself and my children, for the maintenance of my wife and my children, for the proper education of my children and otherwise for the benefit of my wife and my children as my wife in her sole discretion may from time to time determine. In every such year in which the said net revenue is less than the sum of TEN THOUSAND ($10,000) DOLLARS, my Trustee shall pay to the credit of the said income account out of the capital of the trust an additional sum which with the revenue for such year will equal the said sum. If through any unforeseen cause the sum above mentioned should in any such year or years prove insufficient for the said purposes, then my Trustee may in its discretion pay in to the said income account such additional moneys out of the capital of the trust as may be reasonably required for the said purposes. Any moneys from time to time to the credit of the said income account and not required by my wife for the purposes aforesaid, may be taken by my Trustee and shall become part of the capital of the trust hereby created.\nProvision is made in case the widow remarried and for various other contingencies.\nThe case was heard in the Exchequer Court on an agreed statement of facts. There were two children, a girl and boy, issue of the marriage of Dr. Bouck and the appellant and, at the death of the testator, they were respectively sixteen and thirteen years of age. The appellant has not remarried. Since the death of her husband she has \"occupied substantially the same position towards the said children as the late Charles Bouck occupied himself in his lifetime and in particular:\u2014\n(a) She has maintained, supported, educated and borne all expenses in bringing up her son, the said John Bouck, from the date of her husband's death until the present time;\n(b) She has maintained, supported, educated and borne all expenses in bringing up her daughter, Marilyn (Bouck) McDaniel, from the date of her husband's death until the marriage of the said Marilyn (Bouck) McDaniel in the month of October, A.D. 1948. Subsequent to the said marriage she has contributed varying amounts to the welfare of her said daughter;\n(c) She has maintained a large home at the premises municipally known in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, as 1014-Prospect Avenue, the same having been the family residence for a number of years prior to the death of the late Charles Bouck. Further she maintains a summer home at Sylvan Lake, in the Province of Alberta, for her own use and for the use of her children, John and Marilyn, although apart from occasional visits Marilyn has not made use of the said residences since the date of her said marriage;\nAlthough it is the 1944 income that is in question, the assessment thereon was not made until 1948. Included in the total income upon which the respondent assessed the appellant to income tax for 1944 is the sum of $3,797.26, being moneys received by the appellant pursuant to clause 5 of the will. Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the agreed statement of facts are as follows:\u2014\n6. That the Appellant did in fact receive the whole of the said sum of $3,797.26, which said sum was under her sole control, and was expended and used by the Appellant in her sole discretion, and pursuant to said Clause 5 of the said Last Will and Testament to maintain a home for herself and the said children, for the maintenance of herself and the said children for the proper education of the said children, and otherwise for the benefit of herself and her children, and as the Appellant in her sole discretion did from time to time determine.\n7. The Appellant has not kept accounts or made any accounting whatever of the said sum of $3,797.26, nor has the Appellant furnished nor is she able to furnish any accounts to the Minister as to the portions thereof:\u2014\n(a) Expended by her in maintaining a home for herself and children;\n(b) For the maintenance of herself and her children;\n(c) For the proper education of the children;\n(d) Otherwise for the benefit of herself and her children;\n(e) For her separate use;\n(f) For the direct or indirect use of John Bouck and Marilyn Bouck, or either of them;\n8. The Appellant pays for services of a hired man in the maintenance of her home in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta.\n9. That presently:\n(a) The Appellant maintains two automobiles for the use of herself and her son John Bouck;\n(b) If the Appellant had not the responsibility of the maintenance and control of her children she would not require to maintain the large home now maintained by her;\n(c) She estimates that as a minimum her expenses would have been reduced annually by $5,000 had she not supported and maintained her said children.\nIt is understood and agreed that paragraph (c) supra is merely an estimate which the Appellant would make of the position at the present time if she were called to give evidence on her own behalf, and that nothing in the said paragraph 9 is to prejudice or affect the Respondent's position that the assertions made in the said paragraph are inadmissible in evidence and irrelevant, the Respondent's position being that the appeal solely concerns that portion of the year 1944 subsequent to the 19th day of July, A.D. 1944, and that period alone.\nIt should be noted that in case both children died, or either of them, there is no provision whereby the appellant, during her widowhood, should receive less than the moneys to the credit of the \"income account\" so long as they are \"required\". The decisions as to what words create a trust are legion but, in each case, the intention is to be gathered from the document as a whole. In Singer v. Singer 19, the will of the late Jacob Singer directed:\u2014\n\"my said trustees to pay to my wife Annie Singer during the term of her natural life and as long as she will remain my widow the net annual income arising from my estate for the maintenance of herself and our children. Should however my wife remarry then such annuity shall cease.\" Middleton J. who heard the originating motion for the construction of the will in the first instance, held:\u2014\nThe said Annie Singer is not entitled to the net annual income arising from the said estate to her own use absolutely, but subject to the obligation to use the same not only for her maintenance, but also for the maintenance of the children of the testator, and that the right of any child to maintenance does not cease on attaining majority or marriage;\nand he directed a reference to determine what allowance, if any, should be made to each of the children of Jacob Singer out of the income of the estate.\nThe Appellate Division varied this judgment by declaring:\u2014\nThe said Annie Singer is entitled to the net annual income arising from the said estate during her widowhood for her own use absolutely, but subject to an obligation to provide thereout for the maintenance of the children of the testator or such of them as in her discretion to be exercised in good faith she shall deem to require the same, but such obligation does not extend to any child who has or shall be married or otherwise be forisfamiliated.\nAn appeal to this Court 20, was dismissed. The Chief Justice and Duff J. expressed no views upon the point; Sir Louis Davies accepted the Appellate Division's opinion as the correct one, as did Idington J., Anglin J. and Brodeur J. As Anglin J. points out, the difference between the orders made by Middleton J. and by the Appellate Division was that under the latter the discretion of the mother was wider and enabled her, for reasons that seemed to her sufficient, to exclude any child from maintenance.\nHere, to adapt the language of Sir William Meredith, at page 611 of 33 O.L.R., the appellant was entitled to receive the income, subject to an obligation on her part to maintain and educate the children out of it but leaving to her discretion the manner in and the extent to which provision should be made for any child, a discretion not subject to control or interference by the Court so long as it should be exercised in good faith.\nWe are, of course, dealing with the position in 1944 when the appellant had not remarried and the children were under the age of twenty-five years. As has been pointed out, this is not a proceeding to construe Dr. Bouck's will and codicils in which the widow and children are represented. Consequently, we do not know anything about such things as medical expenses for any of the family, charitable donations and entertainment expenses of the appellant, or the cost of help in and around the Calgary home or the summer home although, in March, 1951, when the agreed statement of facts was signed, we know that the appellant was paying for the services of a hired man in the maintenance of the Calgary house. We also know that at that time the appellant maintained two automobiles for the use of herself and John,\u2014the daughter having by that time been married. No doubt in the year of the daughter's marriage, the appellant would have incurred considerable expense with respect to the preparation therefor, a great part of which it could no doubt be asserted was her expense as head of the family. In truth, the money spent by the appellant for the maintenance, education and benefit of either child might be very slight in one year and considerably greater in another. There are such things as premiums on insurance on the automobiles and many other expenses which Dr. Bouck would presumably have in mind as being incurred by the appellant and which it would be difficult to say were for anyone's benefit except her own. In a proceeding upon the construction of the will, these are matters that might be gone into but we know practically nothing about them for the year 1944, which is the year of the income in question.\nIn the first income tax return made by the appellant in April, 1945, although it was a mere estimate of the income of her husband's estate for that part of the year 1944 remaining after his death, the total amount of such estimated income was returned by her as being her income. It was only in January, 1946, that a new return was made in which the income of the appellant from her husband's estate for the relevant part of 1944 was arbitrarily put by her at one-third of the total income. She had, of course, received the total amount in accordance with the provisions of the will and we are not called upon to deal with a case where she received a certain amount from the trustee of the income account for herself and other specific amounts therefrom for each child. Nothing is said as to whether this is possible under the will, or as to the result if it in fact occurs. As the trial judge states, the appellant may find some comfort in the fact that if she succeeded in these proceedings, she would be taxed as a single person without a deduction for each child; to which might be added that in the possible circumstances envisaged above, each child might be subject to tax upon what would be found to be his or her income.\nWhile clause 7 of the will commences:\u2014\"From and after the time when all of my children shall have attained the age of twenty-five years\", and that event might not happen because one might die before attaining that age, provision is subsequently made for the death of either child without issue. Then finally comes clause 14:\u2014\n14. In the event of the death of both of my children without issue then the entire income shall be payable to my wife during her lifetime and after her death the capital of the trust hereby created shall be distributed to my heirs according to the laws of the Province of Alberta then in force with respect to the devolution of intestate estates.\nReading the whole of the will, it appears that if both children died before the ages of twenty-five, clause 14 would operate.\nHowever, the appellant points to clause 7 of the will, dealing with the situation where the children would have attained the age of 25 years. It reads:\u2014\n7. From and after the time when all of my children shall have attained the age of twenty-five (25) years. To pay to my wife during her lifetime in monthly instalments without power of anticipation, one-half the net income of the trust hereby created (after the payment of the cost of administration), and to pay to each of my children during their respective lifetimes, in monthly instalments without power of anticipation, one-quarter of the said net income.\nProvided that in the event of my wife remarrying the said net income shall be thereafter divided one-third to my wife and one-third to each of my children.\nProvided further that if the aggregate amount of the net income payable to my wife and my children in any year is less than the sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, my Trustee shall in every such year pay out of the capital, of the trust hereby created to my wife and my said children a further sum which with the share of income received by them in such year shall amount to the said sum, and such further sum shall be divided among them in the same proportion as the income is divided.\nProvided further that if through any unforeseen cause the sum mentioned in the proviso next preceding should not be sufficient for the proper maintenance of my wife and my children, my Trustee may in its discretion pay to my wife and to my children such additional moneys out of the capital of the trust as may be reasonably required for their respective maintenance. It is said that the change in procedure whereby the trustee is directed to make payments directly to the appellant and no longer into the income account is significant and that in clause 7, as compared with clause 5, are clear words of absolute gift. However, the testator was dealing with an entirely different situation and I am unable to perceive that the manner in which he directed the trustee to deal with the income under those circumstances can affect a matter arising under clause 5.\nThe appellant then refers to clause 4, reading as follows :\n4. To pay in each and every year out of the income of the trust hereby created all taxes upon income assessed or levied in such year against each of the beneficiaries of the said trust with respect to the share of the income of the said trust payable in such year to each respective beneficiary, but not including my wife in the event of her remarrying.\nThe use of the words \"each of the beneficiaries of the said trust\" indicates that the testator had in mind not only his wife, under whose sole control the moneys in the income account should be in accordance with clause 5, but also the children when they should have attained the age of twenty-five years, in accordance with clause 7.\nThe case of Drummond v. Collins 21, has no application. There, the trustees of a deceased United States man were required to exercise their discretion as to providing money for the maintenance of the testator's grandchildren who were, at the time in question, minors. In pursuance of this authority the trustees exercised their discretion and remitted to Mrs. Drummond, the mother of these children, certain sums of money for their maintenance. It was held that, within the meaning of the British Income Tax Act, these sums were derived from remittances from the United States payable in Great Britain, or from money or value received in Great Britain and arising from property that had not been imported into Great Britain. It was also held that they came within the words of Schedule D as profits or gains accruing from property to a person residing in the United Kingdom. There it was the income of the children that was in question. More to the point is the decision of Sir Adrian Knox, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in Manning v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation 22, where a testator devised and bequeathed the whole of his property to his wife in trust for his children\u2014the wife during her life to receive the income thereof for the support and maintenance of herself and the children and after her death the proceeds of the sale of such property to be equally divided between the children. It was held that the wife was entitled to receive the income of the estate subject to no liability to account for its application, provided she discharged the duty of supporting and maintaining the children, following Browne v. Paull 23 :\u2014\nWhere the interest of the children's legacies is given, to a parent, to be applied for or towards their maintenance and education, there, in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intention, the parent takes the interest subject to no account, provided only that he discharges the duty imposed on him of maintaining and educating the children.\nIt was also held by Macnaghten J. in Waley Cohen v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue 24, that sums payable under a trust to a father (the settlor) towards the upkeep of a joint establishment with his sons (the beneficiaries) are income of the father.\nThe decision in Singer v. Singer prevents a holding that under Dr. Bouck's will either child is entitled to an aliquot part of the income. Even if that be not so, the income received by the present appellant in the year 1944 from the \"income account\" is her income. She is not a trustee and the mere fact that there is the responsibility upon her such as is described in the Singer case does not make the money any less her income than if she had received income from B though she might be bound by bond to C to pay the latter a certain annual sum.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014Under the will in question, the testator, by para. 5, directed his trustee to pay to the credit of an \"income account\" the annual net revenue from a trust fund until all his children should have attained the age of twenty-five years, directing that these monies should be under the sole \"control\" of his wife\nto be used by her to maintain a home for herself and my children, for the maintenance of my wife and my children, for the proper education of my children, and otherwise for the benefit of my wife and my children as my wife in her sole discretion may from time to time determine.\nThe testator further provided that any monies to the credit of the account \"not required by my wife for the purposes aforesaid\" should be returned to capital. In the event of the death of his wife before all the children should have attained the specified age, he directed, similarly, that the guardian whom he had appointed for his children should have control of the monies to the credit of the account\nto the extent required to provide for the maintenance, education and benefit of my children as the said guardian in her sole discretion may from time to time determine in the same manner as my wife if living.\nBy para. 7 he further provided that from and after the time when \"all\" his children should have attpained twenty-five, his wife was to be paid one half of the net income of the trust fund for life, and each of the children one quarter during their respective lives, with the further provision that in the event of the net income being less than $10,000 in any year, the deficiency should be made up out of capital. The trustee was also given a discretion to make further payments out of capital should even this sum be insufficient to provide for the proper maintenance of the wife and children. From and after the death of the wife, all of the income was to be paid to the children equally.\nBy para. 9, it is provided that upon the death of either of the children without issue, the income \"which would have gone\" to the deceased child if living, should, during the lifetime of the testator's wife and the surviving child, be paid to the surviving child, with the proviso that\nIn the event of the death of my son without issue but leaving a wife surviving, the share of the income which would have gone to him if living shall be paid * * * to his wife until her death or until she remarries, whichever shall first occur.\nPara. 10 provides that upon the death of his daughter leaving issue, then until the death of the testator's wife and son, \"the share of the income which my daughter would have received if living\" should, until all the issue should have attained twenty-five years, be paid to his widow if living, or if not, to his son, to be used for the maintenance and education of the issue of the daughter until all should have attained the age of twenty-five, and should thereafter during the same period be paid to the issue.\nSimilarly, it is provided by para. 11 that upon the death of his son leaving issue, then until the death of the testator's wife and daughter, the share of the income \"which my son would have received if living\" should, until the issue attained twenty-five years, be paid to his son's widow for the maintenance of herself and the issue and the education of the issue until all shall have attained twenty-five years, and thereafter during the lifetime of his daughter and the testator's widow, be paid to the wife and issue of his son, with the proviso that in the event of the death or remarriage of his son's widow, then \"her interest in the said income\" should cease, and the share \"which should have gone to her\" shall go to the issue. The will contains an ultimate trust, upon the death of the testator's children and wife, for the benefit of his grandchildren who attain twenty-one years.\nIt seems plain on the scheme of this will, that, for example, should the son marry and die before attaining age twenty-five, his widow and children, if any, would stand in his stead with respect to the income. It does not appear that it was the intention of the testator that all benefit in respect of income to the widow of the son and the son's issue should depend upon the son himself having attained the specified age. It is to be observed that the term of existence of the \"income account\" in para. 5, as well as the coming into operation of the provision with respect to payment of specific shares of income to the wife and each of the children, depends upon ALL the testator's children reaching the age of twenty-five years, an event which would, in the case put, never happen.\nThe testator left surviving two children in fact, a son and a daughter, neither of whom has as yet attained the age of twenty-five years. In the existing circumstances, the provisions of para. 5 are the operative provisions, and although the income is under the sole control of the wife, the income is not, in my view, hers absolutely, but is impressed with the obligation, to use no other word, that it be devoted to the objects provided for in that paragraph. I think, therefore, it cannot be said that the entire income is to be regarded as that of the widow for purposes of The Income Tax Act.\nWhile the provisions of this will are not the same as those in question in the will under consideration in Singer v. Singer 25, it is to be observed that even on the terms of that will, it was held that while the mother had a discretion, she was subject to an obligation. The court approved of the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Appellate Division 26, Meredith C.J.O., at 611, said:\nApart from authority, I should have no doubt as to what the testator meant, or as to what the language he has used to express his wish imports, and that is, that his wife should be entitled during her widowhood to receive the income, subject to an obligation on her part to maintain the children out of it, but leaving to her discretion the manner in and extent to which provisions should be made for any child, a discretion not subject to control or interference by the court so long as it should be exercised in good faith * * *\nThe learned Chief Justice thus viewed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Allen v. Furnes 27.\nIn Allen's case, the gift was to a father for life \"for the support and maintenance of himself and children.\" The defendant had been appointed receiver of the interest of the father, the plaintiff, and although there was no trust constituted in favour of the children, the court would not permit the receiver appointed at the instance of creditors to take the whole, but allocated three-quarters of the income for the support of the children.\nIn Re Booth 28, a similar result was arrived at where the mother had become bankrupt and her trustee in bankruptcy claimed the whole of the income. North J. directed an inquiry as to the amount which should be allocated to the children. Although he proceeded on the basis of trust, the result does not differ in a case of this character whether the case be one of trust or \"obligation.\"\nWhere, as in the case at bar, income is placed under the control of a wife and mother for the benefit of herself and children, she being under obligation so to apply it, it would appear to be a contradiction in terms to say that her interest is absolute, and yet that, while her discretion will not be interfered with so long as it is being exercised bona fide, the court will interfere where she is not acting properly in the application of the income, or where creditors intervene for the purpose of seizing it. The fact that the court will thus intervene indicates that the obligation in favour of the children fastens upon the res itself.\nIn Re Coleman 29, a testator gave his residue to trustees, directing them to apply the income\ntowards the maintenance, education and advancement of my children in such manner as they shall deem most expedient.\nuntil the youngest should attain twenty-one, with a gift over to the children as his wife should appoint, and in default of appointment, then equally to the children then living.\nOne of the children had assigned his interest to the plaintiff, and it was held that the latter was entitled to such\nmoneys or property, if any, as may be paid or delivered, or appropriated for payment or delivery\nby the trustees to the assignor. I think equally, in the present case, that the wife, being obligated to apply the income needed for the benefit not only of herself but also for the children, although her discretion is absolute, as was that of the trustees in the case just cited, has an interest limited to that which she appropriates for herself, and the children become entitled to the remainder in the proportions she from time to time determines.\nThe appellant in the returns filed claimed on the basis of an equal apportionment of the income as between herself and the children. The total amount in question is $3,797.26 and this is in respect of the period from the date of the death of the testator on the 19th of July, 1944, to the end of that year. Although the Minister is always in a position, under s. 41 of the statute, to obtain additional information from the taxpayer, no request was made, and the agreed statement of facts contains a statement that the appellant estimates the minimum annual expense of maintaining the children was $5,000. For the period under review this is approximately $2,500. When the maintenance of the appellant herself is taken into consideration, the total maintenance for the three approximates the amount of income here in question. This tends to support the basis of allocation upon which the income tax returns were made.\nI do not think the failure of the appellant to keep an exact account, in the circumstances here present, affects the matter. It is obvious that the expense of maintaining the two children as well as the widow herself was substantial. The family was living as a unit in the home maintained for them, as the testator directed, and a very substantial part of the account would consist of items apportionable only by dividing into three parts. Special expenditures for the benefit of any one of the objects of the gift of income would, of course, stand on a different footing, but the appellant had other income of her own, and if there were such special expenditures, she was entitled to use her own income for the purpose if she saw fit. Accordingly, I think the appellant has sufficiently met the onus resting upon her.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Porter, Allen & MacKimmie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: April 23, 24, 25; 1952: June 30.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nInsurance\u2014Fire\u2014Contents of building\u2014Whether objects lost in fire were part of contents\u2014Whether variation of statutory conditions\u2014Subrogation\u2014Quebec Insurance Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 299, ss. 240, 241\u2014 Articles 1156, 1570, 1571, 2573 C.C.\nThe insured entered into contracts of insurance with the appellant and several other companies for a total fire insurance of $250,000, apportioned $150,000 upon the building and $100,000 on the contents. These policies were \"blanket policies\", identical in terms and each one limiting the issuing company's share of the total risk. The insured was authorized to augment or diminish the total amount but had to maintain an insurance \"de m\u00eame forme, teneur et port\u00e9e\" of a total of $250,000. The word \"contents\" was defined: \"Tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\".\nSubsequently the insured acquired an insurance with the respondent in the sum of $10,000 on certain \"objets d'art\". These were part of the contents of the buildings and initially included under the appellant's policy.\nA fire having occurred, the respondent paid the full amount of the loss on the \"objets d'art\", took a transfer from the ensured and, as the appellant denied any liability to pay a pro rata share, brought action against him. The appellant contended that the \"objets d'art\" did not fall within the term \"contents\" in his policy since they were differently assured. The trial judge dismissed the action, but a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec reversed that judgment.\nHeld (Kellock and Fauteux JJ. dissenting) : that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, since the \"objets d'art\" did not come within the term \"contents\" as defined in the appellant's policy and were, therefore, not covered by its policy at the time of the loss.\nThe words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\u201d are a part of the sentence describing the subject matter and peril insured, and are not a variation of the statutory conditions within the meaning of ss. 240, and 241 of the Quebec Insurance Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing, St. Jacques and Hyde JJ.A. dissenting, the judgment of the trial judge which had dismissed the action.\nA. J. Campbell Q.C. for the appellant. The property described in the policy issued by the respondent was otherwise insured within the meaning of that phrase as used in the appellant's policy and consequently was not covered by the appellant's policy. Otherwise insured means differently insured i.e., a different kind of coverage. The appellant's coverage was a blanket coverage as opposed to the respondent's coverage which was a specific one. That is the meaning that has been assumed throughout by the parties to that policy. Moreover, if it could be said that the provisions of that policy are not free from obscurity, the intention of the parties may be ascertained by taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances and by examining the conduct of the parties themselves insofar as it throws light on the interpretation they may have placed upon their contractual rights.\nWhen one takes into consideration all of the terms of the wording, it is clear that the consent to other insurance is to other blanket insurance of the same form, range and wording. Therefore, even if the property described in the respondent's policy was not \"autrement assur\u00e9\", there was no consent given by the appellant to such insurance and accordingly the appellant ceased to cover.\nThe so-called, transfer and subrogation does not justify the institution of the action. Article 1156 C.C. does not apply, because if the appellant was in any way liable to its assured for the loss of the collection, it was liable in virtue of its obligation to its assured and not in virtue of an obligation owed by it to the assured jointly with others. In view of the fact that each company is only bound for its share, there cannot be any legal subrogation under 1156 C.C. The assured can no longer attack the policy for illegality because he has accepted the validity of that policy by the inference to be drawn from the fact that he has claimed the whole amount from the respondent. Furthermore, no subrogation was ever given by the \"\u00c9cole\" because the requirements of s. 4 of Statute 16 George V (1926), c. 49, which requires two signatures from the \"\u00c9cole\", were not met.\nThe sentence \"tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\", used to define the contents in the appellant's policy is not a variation of the statutory conditions, because this sentence is not a condition of the policy but simply a description or limitation of the risk: Curtis's & Harvey v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Co. Ltd. 2; The London Assurance Corp. v. The Great Northern Transit Co. 3; Palatine Ins. Co. v. Gregory 4 and Ross v. Scottish Union & National Ins. 5.\nJohn T. Hackett Q.C. and R. S. Willis for the respondent. The words \"et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" come in conflict with certain conditions of the policy and in consequence are subject to the provisions of ss. 240 and 241 of the Quebec Insurance Act, and are, therefore, without binding effect on the insured. This sentence is not only descriptive of the property insured but is also a stipulation contradicting the statutory conditions. The test is not whether the stipulation is a condition or a description, but whether the stipulation varies, contradicts, etc. The W. Malcolm MacKay Co. v. The British American Ass. Co. 6 which was approved by the Privy Council in Palatine Ins. Co. v. Gregory (supra).\nEven if the words were purely descriptive, they would not have the effect of freeing the appellant from the obligation to pay by virtue of Article 2573 C.C. The interpretation of the words when read in conjunction with the permission to increase or diminish the total amount of the insurance without notifying the insurers thereof, means that there had to be $250,000 of insurance at all times in like form, tenor and bearing, but once that requirement had been met with, the assured was free to increase the total amount of its insurance in any way it elected. If, however, the Court should come to the conclusion that the language is ambiguous, it should be interpreted against the appellant by the application of the rule contra proferentem.\nThe respondent is entitled to exercise any and all the rights of the insured. He is suing under a sale or transfer of rights. Any right may be transferred if law or policy does not forbid it. There is nothing in the Insurance Act to support the contention that the assured may not transfer his rights to impugn a variation. Considering the wording of the statute (16 George V., c. 49) and the Order in Council and that payment was payable to the Province, which got the money, then the subrogation was rightly signed and was good. The person to give the subrogation is the payee (the Province in this case) and not the assured. Article 1156 C.C. is applicable because the appellant had an interest in the payment of these indemnities.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Telle qu'elle fut intent\u00e9e, l'action de \"The Travelers Fire Insurance Company\" all\u00e9guait exclusivement l'\u00e9mission, en date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1940, par la Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix (d\u00e9fenderesse) d'une police d'assurance contre le feu en faveur de la Corporation des \u00c9coles techniques ou professionnelles, pour une p\u00e9riode de trois ans depuis sa date, pour la somme de $60,000, assurant certains effets contenus dans la b\u00e2tisse de l'\u00c9cole Technique de Montr\u00e9al, y compris l'\u00c9cole du Meuble.\nIl y fut stipul\u00e9 que l'indemnit\u00e9 qui pourrait devenir due, au cas de sinistre, serait payable au Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. La d\u00e9claration ajoutait que, le 2 juin 1940, alors que cette police d'assurance \u00e9tait en vigueur, des pertes caus\u00e9es par le feu, au montant de $7,070.53, furent \u00e9prouv\u00e9es par l'assur\u00e9e aux objets suivants:\nObjets d'art et des meubles faisant partie des collections du mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble, seulement lorsque contenus dans le b\u00e2timent deux \u00e9tages, construit en brique solide, avec toiture en patente, occup\u00e9 comme \u00c9cole du Meuble, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Province de Qu\u00e9bec, et portant le N\u00b0 2020 rue Kimberley.\nL'intim\u00e9e ajoutait que ces objets \u00e9taient \u00e9galement assur\u00e9s, en outre de la Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix, par la Compagnie d'Assurance du Canada contre l'incendie, au montant de $10,000; La Nationale, Compagnie Anonyme d'Assurance contre l'Incendie et les Explosions, pour le m\u00eame montant; \"Commerce Mutual Fire Insurance Company\", \"The Stanstead & Sherbrooke Fire Insurance Company\", \"The Mercantile Fire Insurance Company\" et \"The Missisquoi & Rouville Mutual Fire Insurance Company\", conjointement pour un montant de $20,000; et par l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame, \"The Travelers Fire Insurance Company\", pour un montant de $10,000.\nChacune de ces polices d'assurance, sauf celle de l'intim\u00e9e, stipulait que l'assurance porterait sur le contenu des immeubles de l'appelante et que l'on devrait entendre par \"contenu\": \"tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9.\"\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tendait que cette stipulation \u00e9tait une variation des conditions statutaires n\u00b0 9 et que, comme elle n'\u00e9tait pas indiqu\u00e9e dans la police en la mani\u00e8re exig\u00e9e par la loi, elle \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence sans effet l\u00e9gal et n'engageait pas l'assur\u00e9e.\nLes pertes totales caus\u00e9es par l'incendie d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 s'\u00e9lev\u00e8rent \u00e0 $76,852.14 et chacun des assureurs paya en cons\u00e9quence sa part respective de ce montant de $76,852.14, moins $3,000 support\u00e9s par \"The Phoenix Assurance Company, Limited, of London, England\", en vertu d'une autre police d'assurance.\nL'appelante, cependant, refusa de payer une somme de $1,939.85, repr\u00e9sentant sa part dans le montant de $7,070.53 pour l'indemnit\u00e9 due sur les objets d'art et autres meubles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s plus haut. L'intim\u00e9e se fit donc subroger par l'\u00c9cole du Meuble et le Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec dans leurs droits contre l'appelante, et, apr\u00e8s en avoir signifi\u00e9 le document de subrogation \u00e0 l'appelante, l'intim\u00e9e intenta contre cette derni\u00e8re l'action dont il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nC'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 tout ce qui \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration par laquelle l'action a d\u00e9but\u00e9.\nL'appelante produisit une plaidoirie \u00e9crite niant que la police d'assurance, en vertu de laquelle elle pouvait \u00eatre tenue responsable, contint une variation aux conditions statutaires, et que les mots \"tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" fussent autre chose que la description de l'objet de l'assurance; qu'elle avait acquitt\u00e9 tout ce qu'elle devait \u00e0 la Corporation des \u00c9coles techniques ou professionnelles, ainsi qu'au Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme repr\u00e9sentant sa proportion dans le montant de $76,852.14; et que la somme de $7,070.53, \u00e0 laquelle r\u00e9f\u00e9rait la d\u00e9claration de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e9tait uniquement la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re qui, en la payant au Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, n'avait fait rien autre chose que d'acquitter sa propre dette.\nJusque l\u00e0, il ne s'agissait donc que d'une action bien simple dans laquelle l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e9guant le paiement et la subrogation faite en sa faveur en r\u00e9clamait la part de l'appelante.\nIl n'\u00e9tait donc aucunement question d'une action r\u00e9cursoire, o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e aurait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir pay\u00e9 pour le compte de l'appelante et lui en aurait demand\u00e9 le remboursement.\nCe n'est que dans la r\u00e9ponse que l'on trouve au paragraphe 5 de l'all\u00e9gation suivante:\n5. That Defendent, with the other Insurers mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Declaration, is liable for its respective share of the total loss of $7,070.53, with interest thereon from the 2nd day of August, 1940.\nIl appara\u00eet au dossier et cela est confirm\u00e9 par l'information que nous poss\u00e9dons, qu'une action semblable fut institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e contre les autres compagnies d'assurance d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9es et il fut convenu que la preuve et l'enqu\u00eate seraient communes \u00e0 chacune de ces actions.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que cette nouvelle all\u00e9gation contenue dans la r\u00e9ponse non seulement aurait d\u00fb se trouver dans la d\u00e9claration, mais que, comme elle n'y \u00e9tait pas, m\u00eame si l'intim\u00e9e avait demand\u00e9 la permission au tribunal de l'introduire par voie d'amendement, il est improbable que cette permission e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, vu qu'elle changeait compl\u00e8tement la nature de l'action de l'intim\u00e9e et qu'elle avait pour effet de transformer une simple action directe contre l'appelante en exercice des droits du Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et de l'assur\u00e9e en une action r\u00e9cursoire.\nCependant, l'appelante a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire rejeter cette all\u00e9gation de la r\u00e9ponse, qui est rest\u00e9e dans les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, tant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'en Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel), et il semble bien que la Cour Supr\u00eame n'a pas d'autre alternative que de consid\u00e9rer le litige \u00e0 la fois comme comportant une action directe et une action r\u00e9cursoire, m\u00eame en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'il soit douteux que cela ne constitue pas un cumul de recours incompatibles ou contradictoires ne tendant pas \u00e0 des condamnations de m\u00eame nature o\u00f9 l'appelante, par voie d'exception dilatoire, e\u00fbt pu contraindre l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 'aire option, en vertu de l'article 177 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nA notre humble avis, cette situation met l'appelante dans une position d\u00e9favorable. Sur la d\u00e9claration, telle que r\u00e9dig\u00e9e d'abord, elle n'avait qu'\u00e0 rencontrer la r\u00e9clamation de l'assur\u00e9e et \u00e0 lui opposer, entre autres, le contrat d'assurance par lequel l'assur\u00e9e se trouvait li\u00e9e au moins par acquiescement. Au contraire, lorsque l'intim\u00e9e ajoute aux droits dans lesquels elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 subrog\u00e9e la pr\u00e9tention qu'elle n'a fait que payer une somme due par l'appelante et qu'elle est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 se faire rembourser par cette derni\u00e8re, il s'agit alors d'un droit tout diff\u00e9rent o\u00f9 les moyens de d\u00e9fense de l'appelante ne sont plus les m\u00eames.\nL'appelante n'aurait qu'\u00e0 se bl\u00e2mer elle-m\u00eame si cela devait tourner \u00e0 son d\u00e9savantage. Mais je ne vois pas comment nous pouvons traiter la cause comme si le paragraphe 5 de la r\u00e9ponse ne se trouvait pas au dossier.\nIl importe tout d'abord de signaler que la police d'assurance \u00e9mise par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d'une nature diff\u00e9rente de celle des autres compagnies. Alors que les autres polices d'assurance couvraient \"le contenu des b\u00e2timents d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent\" et \u00e9galement \"les choses, d\u00e9crites ci-apr\u00e8s sous le titre \"contenu\" se trouvant dans un rayon de 50 pieds\" des b\u00e2timents, alors que le \"contenu\" \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme \"tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\", la police de l'intim\u00e9e, au contraire, \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cifique et ne couvrait que les \"objets d'art et autres meubles faisant partie des collections du mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble\".\nM\u00eame en envisageant le paragraphe 5 de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e, il est donc tout \u00e0 fait inexact de dire que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec les autres compagnies d'assurance.\nL'appelante et les six autres compagnies assuraient les m\u00eames objets, bien que pour des montants diff\u00e9rents, \u00e0 savoir: \"tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\". Du moment que ce qui se trouvait dans les immeubles et qui n'\u00e9tait pas autrement assur\u00e9 lors de l'incendie \u00e9tait d\u00e9truit par le feu, chacune des six compagnies, ainsi que l'appelante, devenait responsable pour la perte dans la proportion du montant pour lequel chacune avait assur\u00e9. Mais le d\u00e9tenteur de ces polices, propri\u00e9taire de ce qui \u00e9tait contenu dans les immeubles, avait stipul\u00e9\u2014comme il en avait le droit\u2014que ces polices ne couvriraient pas ce qui \u00e9tait autrement assur\u00e9. Il lui appartenait de d\u00e9cider pour lui-m\u00eame la nature de la police d'assurance qu'il d\u00e9sirait obtenir et l'\u00e9tendue du risque dont chaque police r\u00e9pondrait.\nL'assur\u00e9e consentit, entre autres, avec l'appelante, un contrat par lequel cette derni\u00e8re s'est oblig\u00e9e, moyennant une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, appel\u00e9e prime, \u00e0 certaines prestations, au cas o\u00f9 se r\u00e9aliseraient certaines \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s (\u00e0 savoir: l'incendie), relative \u00e0 des biens d\u00e9termin\u00e9s dans la police. Il fut convenu entre l'assureur et l'assur\u00e9e que les biens pour la perte desquels l'assur\u00e9e aurait le droit de r\u00e9clamer une indemnit\u00e9 seraient ceux qui se trouveraient dans les immeubles de l'assur\u00e9e, au moment de l'incendie, mais ne comprendraient pas ceux qui \u00e9taient \"autrement assur\u00e9s\".\nJe ne puis me convaincre qu'il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 de la description des objets assur\u00e9s et que ceux qui \u00e9taient \"autrement assur\u00e9s\" se trouvaient par le fait m\u00eame de cette autre assurance soustraits \u00e0 la description et cessaient d'\u00eatre assur\u00e9s par la police de l'appelante. C'est bien ainsi que toutes les autres compagnies d'assurance int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ont compris la convention. Chacune d'elle a oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action de l'intim\u00e9e la m\u00eame contestation que celle de l'appelante. Elles \u00e9taient toutes r\u00e9unies devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel). A la suite du jugement de cette derni\u00e8re Cour, les autres compagnies d'assurance n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de persister; elles se sont simplement soumises au jugement qui les condamnait. Par l\u00e0, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contraintes de payer, mais il n'y faut voir aucun acquiescement; et, d'ailleurs, l'acquiescement des autres compagnies ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre l'appelante. Si elle a raison, le fait que les compagnies qui \u00e9taient sur le m\u00eame pied qu'elle ont fini par c\u00e9der ne saurait pr\u00e9valoir contre son droit \u00e0 elle.\nMais il r\u00e9sulte in\u00e9luctablement que, lorsque l'\u00c9cole du Meuble a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'assurer sp\u00e9cialement les objets d'art et les autres meubles sp\u00e9cifiquement d\u00e9crits dans la police d'assurance de l'intim\u00e9e, ces objets d'art et ces autres meubles se sont trouv\u00e9s autrement assur\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e, et, par le fait m\u00eame, ont cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre assur\u00e9s par l'appelante et les autres compagnies. Il s'ensuit que, lorsque l'intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 contre l'appelante les droits que pr\u00e9tendaient poss\u00e9der l'\u00c9cole du Meuble et le Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, elle a voulu tenir l'appelante responsable de la perte d'objets qui n'\u00e9taient plus assur\u00e9s par l'appelante. Vainement l'intim\u00e9e aurait-elle pr\u00e9tendu que l'\u00c9cole du Meuble n'avait pas le droit de prendre une autre assurance ou une assurance suppl\u00e9mentaire, car, en outre que cette question ne pouvait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e que par La Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix, ou par les six autres compagnies qui avaient assum\u00e9 le risque originairement, si cette assurance suppl\u00e9mentaire constituait une infraction \u00e0 leur convention, c'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 une objection appartenant exclusivement \u00e0 chacune de ces compagnies, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'appelante, et l'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait la soulever. En le faisant, l'intim\u00e9e eut excip\u00e9 du droit d'autrui.\nD'ailleurs, le probl\u00e8me ne se pose pas puisque les polices d'assurance elles-m\u00eames \u00e9mises par l'appelante et les six autres compagnies autorisaient l'assur\u00e9e \u00e0 obtenir cette police d'assurance suppl\u00e9mentaire.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action de l'intim\u00e9e en \u00e9tant d'avis que les mots \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" ne faisaient pas partie de la description des objets qui se trouvaient assur\u00e9s par l'appelante au moment de l'incendie, mais en les consid\u00e9rant comme une variation des conditions statutaires. Et, comme ces mots n'\u00e9taient pas inscrits dans la police d'assurance conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la Loi de Qu\u00e9bec, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'\u00c9cole du Meuble n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e par eux et que l'appelante ne pouvait pas en avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Elle cite la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Curtis's & Harvey v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Company Limited 7 et un passage du jugement de Lord Dunedin qui, \u00e0 mon humble point de vue, me para\u00eet contraire aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e. Il se lit comme suit:\nTheir Lordships think that it is the policy of the statute to make a hard and fast rule that every fire policy shall have attached to it these statutory conditions, and that they cannot be varied so as to be binding on the insured, unless the variations are authenticated in the prescribed manner. The result will be that, \"if not varied, they remain in full force, but any other stipulation and covenant which may define or limit the risk can also receive effect in so far as it does not contradict the statutory conditions which are paramount.\"\nIl y est bien dit: \"but any other stipulation and covenant which may define or limit the risk can also receive effect in so far as it does not contradict the statutory conditions which are 'paramount'. \"\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure cite encore un jugement de notre Cour dans The London Assurance Corporation v. The Great Northern Transit Co. 8. Voici le passage en question :\nIn this case the policy insured the SS. Baltic whilst running in the inland rivers and canals during the season of navigation. To be laid up in a case of safety during the winter months from any extra hazardous building.\nSedgewick J. at page 583:\u2014\nOne other point remains. It is contended that the stipulation contained in the words \"whilst running\" etc., is a condition without the meaning of the Ontario Insurance Act, and in as much as it varies from or is in addition to the conditions by that Act made statutory the policy should comply with section 115 of the Act which provides that such variations or additions should be printed in conspicuous type and in ink of different colour. So far as this point is concerned, I entirely agree with the view taken by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal and Mr. Justice Osler. The stipulation in question is in no sense a condition but rather a description of the subject matter insured. It is descriptive of and has reference solely to the risk covered by the policy and, not to the happening of an event which by the statutory conditions would render the policy void. The statute, therefore, does not apply. De nouveau, cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les mots \"whilst running in the inland rivers and canals during the season of navigation\" n'\u00e9taient aucunement une condition mais plut\u00f4t une description de l'objet assur\u00e9.\nA un moment de son jugement, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure semble s'\u00eatre demand\u00e9e si les mots \"non autrement assur\u00e9\" pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une garantie, mais elle para\u00eet avoir \u00e9cart\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention.\nEn effet, il para\u00eetrait surprenant qu'un propri\u00e9taire qui assure garantirait qu'il maintiendrait sur les lieux, jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'incendie, les effets pour lesquels il a demand\u00e9 une assurance. Tout simplement la police d'assurance ne couvre pas autre chose que la perte des effets qui se trouvent sur les lieux au moment de l'incendie et l'assur\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9clamer rien d'autre. Cet argument \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre qu'un propri\u00e9taire assur\u00e9 s'engage \u00e0 ne jamais \u00e9liminer de son immeuble les effets qui s'y trouvaient lorsque la police d'assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise. Or, c'est lui-m\u00eame qui a stipul\u00e9 que cette police ne couvrirait que les effets qui n'\u00e9taient pas autrement assur\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'incendie et il aurait les mains li\u00e9es pour l'emp\u00eacher d'assurer autrement ces m\u00eames effets.\nAutant dit pour la question de savoir quelle est la nature de cette stipulation (\"et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\") et si vraiment elle est autre chose que la d\u00e9signation ou la description des effets qui se trouveront assur\u00e9s au moment de l'incendie.\nMais j'avoue comprendre encore moins la pr\u00e9tention que cette stipulation serait contraire aux conditions statutaires qui, en d\u00e9finitive, semble le motif de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et celui de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel) 9.\nJ'insiste sur le fait qu'il faut y trouver un changement aux conditions de la police d'assurance aux termes de l'article 241 de la Loi des Assurances de. Qu\u00e9bec, c'est-\u00e0-dire, une variation des conditions mentionn\u00e9es dans cette Loi. Or, je cherche encore en quoi l'addition des mots \"et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une variation des conditions statutaires, car il ne s'agit pas \u00e9videmment de ce que l'intim\u00e9e semble soumettre d'une pr\u00e9tendue contradiction entre les mots en question et les autres stipulations de la police d'assurance. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement pour que ces mots aient \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement introduits dans la police d'assurance de l'appelante qu'ils constituent un changement aux conditions statutaires proprement dites et qu'ils n'y aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9s en caract\u00e8res voyants et en encre d'une couleur diff\u00e9rente. Ce n'est certainement pas l'article 7 des conditions statutaires avec lequel l'on pourrait dire que les mots en discussion entrent en conflit. Je n'ai m\u00eame pas besoin de le reproduire, car cela est \u00e9vident.\nCe n'est pas, non plus, \u00e0 l'article 8 des conditions statutaires que les mots incrimin\u00e9s comportent une d\u00e9rogation. Cet article est \u00e0 l'effet que la compagnie d'assurance n'est pas responsable de la perte, s'il y a quelque autre assurance ant\u00e9rieure dans une autre compagnie \"\u00e0 moins que le consentement de la compagnie \u00e0 cet effet n'apparaisse dans la police ou au dos de la police \u2026 ou \u00e0 moins que la compagnie n'ait fait d\u00e9faut de s'y opposer par \u00e9crit dans les deux semaines apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un avis par \u00e9crit de l'intention ou du d\u00e9sir d'effectuer l'assurance subs\u00e9quente, ou ne s'oppose par \u00e9crit apr\u00e8s ce temps, mais avant que l'assurance subs\u00e9quente ou additionnelle soit effectu\u00e9e.\" Or, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le consentement de la compagnie d'assurance \u00e0 augmenter ou \u00e0 diminuer le montant total des assurances est clairement pr\u00e9vu dans les clauses de la police de l'appelante. Mais, d'ailleurs, ce serait l\u00e0 une objection ou une d\u00e9fense qui appartiendrait \u00e0 la compagnie d'assurance appelante et ce ne serait s\u00fbrement pas l'assur\u00e9e qui pourrait invoquer une pareille contravention au contrat\u2014si cette contravention existait\u2014dont elle se serait elle-m\u00eame rendue coupable. De toute fa\u00e7on, je ne vois pas en quoi les mots \"et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" pourraient venir en conflit avec cet article 8.\nIl reste l'article 9 qui pourvoit que dans le cas o\u00f9 une autre assurance aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite, au cas o\u00f9 telle autre assurance serait encore en vigueur au moment de la perte, chaque compagnie d'assurance n'est responsable que pour sa part ou sa proportion de la perte ou du dommage, sans tenir compte des dates des diff\u00e9rentes polices d'assurance. Je continue de me demander en quoi l'addition des mots \"et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" vient en conflit avec cet article des conditions statutaires. L'on pr\u00e9tend que l'effet de l'insertion de ces mots enl\u00e8ve \u00e0 chaque compagnie et, en particulier, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, je suppose, le droit d'exiger le paiement de sa part par les autres compagnies. Que l'on remarque bien qu'il s'agit d'une \"autre assurance sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans la police\", c'est-\u00e0-dire, sur la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Je ne me demande pas si les autres compagnies d'assurance qui avaient \u00e9mis une police semblable \u00e0 celle de l'appelante, auraient pu pr\u00e9tendre que c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 l'article 9. La question ne se pose pas, bien qu'il est juste de faire remarquer que chacune des six autres compagnies d'assurance a soulev\u00e9, \u00e0 l'encontre de la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9e, la m\u00eame objection que l'appelante fait dans le pr\u00e9sent appel et que, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, elles ne se sont soumises qu'\u00e0 la suite du jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel) qu'elles n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de porter devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, ainsi que le fait l'appelante pr\u00e9sentement. Mais en quoi l'intim\u00e9e, avec une police d'assurance diff\u00e9rente, qui couvre des objets d'art et des meubles dont l'assur\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame a stipul\u00e9 que ces objets, \u00e9tant autrement assur\u00e9s, cesseraient d'\u00eatre assur\u00e9s par l'appelante, peut-elle pr\u00e9tendre que l'article 9 s'applique \u00e0 elle? Au moment de la perte, l'intim\u00e9e assurait des objets d'art et des meubles pour lesquels elle avait sp\u00e9cifiquement assum\u00e9 le risque et ces m\u00eames objets d'art et ces meubles avaient cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre assur\u00e9s, ou avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soustraits \u00e0 la police d'assurance de l'appelante, par l'acte de l'assur\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame. C'est cette derni\u00e8re qui a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'assurer sp\u00e9cialement les objets d'art et les meubles en question et qui avait stipul\u00e9 que, d\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 elle les assurait autrement, l'appelante cesserait d'en \u00eatre responsable par le fait qu'ils \u00e9taient autrement assur\u00e9s.\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, je m'accorde avec les jugements dissidents de MM. les Juges St-Jacques et Hyde et, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, je ne fais vraiment que r\u00e9affirmer les arguments et les motifs contenus dans ces jugements. Je suis m\u00eame impressionn\u00e9 par ce passage des raisons de M. le juge Casey, qui a sign\u00e9 le jugement formel de la Cour, et qui se lit comme suit:\nI am prepared to concede that the words \"autrement assur\u00e9\" limit the risk. Also I take as established that when the fire occurred the effects in question were insured under a policy separate and distinct from those issued by respondents. What I cannot accept however, is the conclusion drawn by respondents from these two premises; I cannot admit as a conclusion that the goods were excluded by the descriptive words \"autrement assur\u00e9\".\nBien respectueusement, du moment que l'on conc\u00e8de que les mots \"autrement assur\u00e9\" limitent le risque, il m'est impossible de suivre le savant juge dans sa conclusion. Si les mots cit\u00e9s limitent le risque, d\u00e8s lors ils font partie de la description du risque, et \"tout ce qui, lors de l'incendie, se trouvait dans les immeubles et qui \u00e9tait autrement assur\u00e9\"\u2014\u00e0 savoir, assur\u00e9 par la compagnie intim\u00e9e\u2014n'\u00e9tait pas assur\u00e9 par la compagnie appelante.\nEt il est important de se rendre compte \u00e0 quelle cons\u00e9quence nous conduirait la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e et le jugement dont est fait appel. Cela \u00e9quivaudrait ni plus ni moins \u00e0 dire que l'appelante pourrait \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 la perte d'effets qu'elle n'assurait pas.\nPour toutes ces raisons, j'en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et que l'action de l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens, dans toutes les Cours.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Plusieurs de mes coll\u00e8gues, dont j'ai eu l'avantage de lire les notes, ont rapport\u00e9 les faits de cette cause. Il serait en cons\u00e9quence superflu de les exposer au complet de nouveau. Je d\u00e9sire cependant ajouter les consid\u00e9rations suivantes pour lesquelles, je crois que l'appel qui nous est soumis doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLes polices \u00e9mises contre le feu, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de La Corporation des \u00c9coles Techniques ou Professionnelles de Montr\u00e9al, qui comprend l'\u00c9cole du Meuble, l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 par les compagnies suivantes:\u2014\nLa Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix ................................................. $150,000 00\nLa Compagnie d'Assurance du Canada\ncontre l'Incendie ........................................................................... 25,000 00\nLa Nationale de Paris ........................................................................ 25,000 00\nLa Stanstead & Sherbrooke Fire Insurance\nCompany et al .............................................................................. 50,000 00\nTotal ......................................................................... $250,000 00 Ces compagnies ont assum\u00e9 l'obligation d'indemniser l'assur\u00e9e contre l'incendie, mais leur risque \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 $150,000 sur les immeubles et \u00e0 $100,000 sur leur contenu, et la responsabilit\u00e9 de chacune \u00e9tait proportionnelle au montant de la police. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre l'assur\u00e9e et les compagnies d'assurance, dans des polices r\u00e9dig\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on identique, que la Corporation s'engageait \u00e0 maintenir \"en vigueur une assurance de m\u00eame forme, teneur et port\u00e9e au montant total de $250,000, divis\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de $150,000 sur les b\u00e2timents et de $100,000 sur le contenu.\" En outre, l'assur\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \"\u00e0 augmenter ou \u00e0 diminuer le montant total de ses assurances sans en avertir les assureurs; ceux-ci renon\u00e7ant au pr\u00e9avis pour toute assurance souscrite ant\u00e9rieurement ou post\u00e9rieurement au pr\u00e9sent contrat.\"\nToutes ces polices sont ce que l'on est convenu d'appeler des \"blanket policies\", ou si l'on aime mieux des polices susceptibles de fluctuations ou de changements et qui couvrent des biens en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, plut\u00f4t que des biens sp\u00e9cifiques et d\u00e9termin\u00e9s. (Black, Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition, page 226).\nLes clauses 8 et 9 des conditions statutaires de ces polices se lisent ainsi:\u2014\n8. La compagnie n'est pas responsable de la perte, s'il y a quelqu'autre assurance ant\u00e9rieure dans une autre compagnie, \u00e0 moins que le consentement de la compagnie \u00e0 cet effet n'apparaisse dans la police ou au dos de la police, ou si quelqu'autre assurance subs\u00e9quente est effectu\u00e9e par une autre compagnie, \u00e0 moins et avant que la compagnie n'y consente, ou \u00e0 moins que la compagnie n'ait fait d\u00e9faut de s'y opposer par \u00e9crit dans les deux semaines apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un avis par \u00e9crit de l'intention ou du d\u00e9sir d'effectuer l'assurance subs\u00e9quente, ou ne s'oppose par \u00e9crit apr\u00e8s ce temps mais avant que l'assurance, subs\u00e9quente ou additionnelle soit effectu\u00e9e.\n9. Dans le cas o\u00f9 il y a eu consentement comme susdit \u00e0 toute autre assurance sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans cette police, cette compagnie, si telle autre assurance reste en vigueur, advenant une perte ou un dommage, n'est responsable que du paiement d'une partie proportionnelle de cette perte ou de ce dommage sans \u00e9gard aux dates des diff\u00e9rentes polices.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de ceci que l'assur\u00e9e devait toujours maintenir ses polices \u00e0 $250,000, \"de m\u00eames force, teneur et port\u00e9e\", qu'elle avait le droit de les augmenter, mais de ne jamais les r\u00e9duire \u00e0 un niveau plus bas que celui stipul\u00e9, qu'elle pouvait agir ainsi sans donner avis \u00e0 ses assureurs par suite du consentement \u00e9crit de ces derniers, et que dans le cas d'incendie, toutes les compagnies d'assurance, m\u00eame celles qui avaient \u00e9mis des polices subs\u00e9quentes, \u00e9taient tenues proportionnellement au paiement des pertes, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la date des polices.\nOr, il est arriv\u00e9 que la Corporation des \u00c9coles Techniques ou Professionnelles de Montr\u00e9al, quelque temps apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre assur\u00e9e avec les compagnies pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9es, a fait \u00e9mettre par l'intim\u00e9e, La Travelers Fire Insurance Company, une nouvelle police couvrant jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $10,000, les effets suivants:\u2014\n$10,000. Sur Objets d'Art et des meubles faisant partie des collections du mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble, seulement lorsque contenus le b\u00e2timent \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages, construit en brique solide, avec toiture en patente, occup\u00e9 comme \u00c9cole du Meuble, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Province de Qu\u00e9bec, et portant le No. 2020 rue Kimberley.\nApr\u00e8s un incendie, dont les dommages se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 $76,852.14, survenu le 2 juin 1940, les comptes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s et l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9bours\u00e9 la somme de $7,070.53 pour les effets qu'elle avait assur\u00e9s. Elle a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de la Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix, en vertu de la clause 9 des conditions statutaires, sa proportion du risque, soit $1,939.85 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ce qui forme un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $2,000, n\u00e9cessaire pour donner juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour. Cette r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais maintenue par la Cour d'Appel 10, MM. les juges St-Jacques et Hyde \u00e9tant dissidents.\nL'intim\u00e9e, qui a pay\u00e9 en totalit\u00e9 la somme de $7,070.53, a \u00e9t\u00e9 subrog\u00e9e dans les droits de l'assur\u00e9e contre ses co-assureurs, mais nous n'avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que sa r\u00e9clamation contre l'appelante-d\u00e9fenderesse. Celle-ci invoque l'une des clauses de la police qu'elle a \u00e9mise et qui par l'op\u00e9ration de la subrogation limiterait les droits de l'appelante \u00e0 ceux de l'assur\u00e9e. Cette clause est \u00e0 l'effet que La Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Ph\u00e9nix assure le contenu des immeubles de La Corporation des \u00c9coles Techniques ou Professionnelles, mais est exclu du risque, \"tout ce qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9.\" L'appelante pr\u00e9tend que les \"objets d'art de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble\", \u00e9tant assur\u00e9s par la police de la Travelers Fire Insurance, il en r\u00e9sulterait que l'appelante ne pourrait \u00eatre appel\u00e9e de m\u00eame que ses co-assureurs \u00e0 partager proportionnellement avec l'intim\u00e9e qui seule aurait assum\u00e9 ce risque. Je m'accorde avec cette pr\u00e9tention, non pas parce qu'il existe une autre police d'assurance \u00e9mise par la Travelers, qu'en vertu des polices l'assur\u00e9e avait incontestablement le droit de prendre, mais parce qu'il existe une police \"diff\u00e9rente\" que celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mises, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, l'assur\u00e9e est \"autrement assur\u00e9e\" aux termes m\u00eames de la police qui limite ainsi les obligations de l'appelante. \"Autrement assur\u00e9e\" a n\u00e9cessairement le sens de \"diff\u00e9remment assur\u00e9e.\"\nLes compagnies d'assurance ont voulu, et c'est le risque qu'elles ont assum\u00e9 en consid\u00e9ration de la prime qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e, que des polices de \"m\u00eames forme, teneur et port\u00e9e\", que celles \u00e9mises par elles, atteignent toujours la somme de $250,000 avec permission de d\u00e9passer ce montant. Il \u00e9tait donc essentiel que chaque police additionnelle, pour qu'intervienne la responsabilit\u00e9 proportionnelle, soit une police g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (blanket policy). Lorsque, comme c'\u00e9tait son droit, l'assur\u00e9e a fait \u00e9mettre une police additionnelle sur des biens \"sp\u00e9cifiques\", comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, les effets assur\u00e9s sont devenus \"autrement\" c'est-\u00e0-dire \"diff\u00e9remment assur\u00e9s\" et ont cess\u00e9 de faire partie du risque couvert par l'appelante. Ils en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soustraits par la volont\u00e9 m\u00eame des parties contractantes.\nIl est rationnel qu'il en soit ainsi, et que les quatre compagnies d'assurance qui ont \u00e9mis les premi\u00e8res polices, consentent \u00e0 partager le risque avec d'autres compagnies qui \u00e9mettent des polices identiques, mais refusent de le faire avec d'autres qui assurent hors leur connaissance, les biens d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour cela qu'on y ins\u00e8re cette clause qui exclut les objets \"autrement assur\u00e9s.\" Ignorer ces mots serait les effacer de la police. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement leur donner un sens. Le pouvoir qui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9e d'augmenter ses assurances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, ne vient nullement en conflit avec la clause qui exempte de responsabilit\u00e9 les assureurs des biens \"autrement assur\u00e9s.\" Comme second moyen l'intim\u00e9e invoque l'article 241 de la Loi des assurances, c. 299, S.R.Q. 1941, qui se lit ainsi:\u2014\n241. Si l'assureur d\u00e9sire faire des changements aux conditions de la police, en omettre quelqu'une ou en ajouter de nouvelles, il doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 au contrat contenant les conditions imprim\u00e9es, des mots \u00e0 l'effet suivant, imprim\u00e9s en caract\u00e8res voyants et en encre d'une couleur diff\u00e9rente :\n\"CHANGEMENTS DANS LES CONDITIONS\"\nCette police est \u00e9mise sous les conditions ci-dessus avec les changements et les additions qui suivent: (\u00e9noncer les changements et les additions).\n\"Ces changements sont faits en vertu de la Loi des assurances de Qu\u00e9bec et restent en vigueur en autant que le tribunal ou le juge auquel sera soumise une question s'y rattachant, consid\u00e9rera juste et raisonnable de la part de la compagnie d'en exiger l'application.\"\nAucun tel changement, addition ou omission, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre distinctement expos\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent article n'est l\u00e9gal ou obligatoire pour l'assur\u00e9.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e qu'il y a eu une variation des conditions statutaires, qui ne lie pas l'assur\u00e9e, parce qu'on aurait omis d'indiquer en encre de couleur diff\u00e9rente que l'assureur, pour les biens \"autrement assur\u00e9s\" ne participera pas proportionnellement dans le cas d'incendie. Je suis d'opinion que ce moyen est non fond\u00e9, car il ne s'agit pas d'une condition, mais plut\u00f4t d'une limitation de responsabilit\u00e9. C'est une description des biens assur\u00e9s qu'on a voulu faire et \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention des parties de d\u00e9terminer la quantit\u00e9 et l'identit\u00e9 des objets que la police devait couvrir. L'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e n'ont pas assur\u00e9 les m\u00eames biens. Il ne peut \u00eatre question de paiement proportionnel.\nEnfin, il est inutile, \u00e0 cause de ma conclusion, d'examiner la question de savoir si le transfert avec subrogation, obtenu par la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait suffisant pour la justifier d'instituer la pr\u00e9sente action.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, et l'action rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nThe dissenting judgment of Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J. :\u2014The policy here in question was issued on February 7, 1940, by the appellant in a form common to a number of other policies issued concurrently therewith by companies underwriting a total sum of $250,000, of which $150,000 was on buildings and $100,000 on their contents, the share of this insurance taken by the appellant being $150,000. The relevant provisions, which I have numbered for convenience of reference, are as follows :\n$100,000. Sur le contenu des b\u00e2timents d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et sur les choses d\u00e9crites ci-apr\u00e8s sous le titre \"contenu\" se trouvant dans un rayon de 50 pieds de ceux-ci.\n1. L'on entendra\npar contenu: tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9 . . . .\n(This is followed by an enumeration including therein articles which would otherwise have been excluded from the coverage by statutory condition 7.)\n2. L'assurance portera sur ce qui appartient \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9e, sur les choses qui, vendues, n'auraient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9es et sur celles qui lui sont confi\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de commissionnaire, de consignataire ou pour r\u00e9paration et enfin, sur tout ce dont elle peut \u00eatre tenue responsable.\n3. L'assurance portera \u00e9galement sur les choses que l'assur\u00e9e ach\u00e8te \u00e0 temp\u00e9rament et sur lesquelles elle a un droit de d\u00e9tenteur pr\u00e9caire, sous condition suspensive en vertu du contrat de vente portant que le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 reviendra \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9e une fois le prix enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9.\n4. L'assur\u00e9e s'engage \u00e0 maintenir en vigueur une assurance de m\u00eames forme, teneur et port\u00e9e au montant total de $250,000, divis\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de $150,000 sur les b\u00e2timents et de $100,000 sur le contenu. Si elle ne se conforme pas \u00e0 cette convention, l'assur\u00e9e deviendra co-assureur pour le d\u00e9ficit.\n5. L'assur\u00e9e est autoris\u00e9e:\na) \u00e0 augmenter ou \u00e0 diminuer le montant total de ses assurances sans en avertir les assureurs; ceux-ci renoncent au pr\u00e9avis pour toute assurance souscrite ant\u00e9rieurement ou post\u00e9rieurement au pr\u00e9sent contrat. Cette pr\u00e9rogative ne lib\u00e8re pas l'assur\u00e9e, cependant, de la convention relative au montant minimum d'assurance mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\nThe position of the appellant is that the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" in para. 1 form part of the description of the risk and that as, at the time of the loss, part of the contents were insured under the respondent's policy, such goods ceased to be covered by the policy of the appellant, with the result that the latter is under no obligation to contribute to the loss. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that its policy was issued within the permission provided for by para. 5 and that, by reason of statutory condition 9, the appellant is liable for a rateable proportion of the loss and that the language in para. 1 upon which the appellant relies, cannot be given effect as against the statutory condition. It is undoubted that the words, the meaning of which is in dispute, viz. \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\", taken alone, might very well be considered to come within the principle of such a case as London Assurance Co. v. Great Northern Transit Co. 11, as forming part of the description of the risk, with the result for which the appellant contends. In Republic Fire Ins. Co. v. Strong 12, a case in this court, not reported in the regular reports, the policy provided that\nThis policy does not attach to or become insurance upon property herein described which at the time of any loss is otherwise insured, until the liability of such other insurance has been exhausted, and shall then cover only such loss or damage as may exceed the amount due from such insurance.\nIt was held that under such a policy there could be no contribution. The coverage according to its terms, applied only after all other insurance had been paid.\nComing back to the case in hand, if a policy were written so as to provide coverage only until or so long as the property insured should not be covered by any other insurance, a clause in such a policy giving the assured permission to effect other insurance could have no relevancy, to say nothing, for the moment, as to a clause permitting the assured to \"increase\" his insurance. An insurer whose policy is to cease to cover upon any other insurance being effected on the insured property has no interest in giving permission to his assured to effect other insurance. Such permission is only relevant to prevent the avoidance, by the operation of statutory condition 8, of the existing insurance if further insurance is effected. But under a policy such as I am now considering, that result would be effected by the terms of the policy itself.\nAccordingly, a provision that the policy will cease to attach if other insurance is effected, and a provision in the same policy that the assured may \"increase\" his insurance, assuming, as it does, that the policy which contains that permission will continue, are prima facie antagonistic. It is therefore necessary, in the case at bar, to scrutinize these provisions to see if the repugnancy may be resolved. The words \"autrement assur\u00e9\" which, according to Larousse, are the equivalent of \"d'une autre fa\u00e7on assur\u00e9,\" considered apart from any context, are capable of more than one meaning, namely, that the interest of the assured (1) is not already insured; (2) will not be insured by any other insurer at the time of loss; (3) will not be covered by insurance taken out at the instance of any other person.\nThe appellant contends for still another meaning, namely, that, as put in its factum,\nnot insured otherwise than in virtue of the blanket coverage provided by the appellant's policy.\nThis contention is explained to mean that if at the time of any loss there is in existence any other insurance effected by the assured on the goods which does not cover the entire contents and which is not of the same \"forme, teneur et port\u00e9e\" as the appellant's policy, the goods, or any specific part of them so covered, will be \"autrement assur\u00e9\" within the meaning of the appellant's policy and not covered thereby.\nThis meaning for which the appellant contends is not, as already pointed out, a meaning which the words in question bear when taken by themselves without a context. Such a result is only to be reached by reading into para. 1 words which are not there, but which are to be found only in para. 4. To reach such a result it is necessary for the appellant, as it does, to contend further that the same words are also to be read into para. 5 so as to qualify the permission provided by that paragraph. Unless the clear language of para. 5 is to be thus modified, this whole contention falls. There are, in my view, a number of reasons why the contention cannot be accepted.\nIn the first place, unlike the words in question in para. 1, which are capable of more than meaning, the language used in para. 5 is perfectly clear and proceeds on the basis that if the permission which it contains is acted upon, either in the continuance of insurance already existing upon the goods at the date of issue of appellant's policy or by the placing of additional insurance, the insurance provided by the appellant's policy and those of the other members of the group will remain in force. No other effect can be given to the word \"augmenter.\" Further, the words which Mr. Campbell seeks to read into para. 5 are to be found only in para. 4, and it is to be observed that para. 5 expressly refers to para. 4, but for one purpose only, namely, to make it perfectly clear that the permission given by para. 5 to \"diminuer\" the total amount of insurance is not to free the assured from the obligation imposed upon him by para. 4, to keep in force insurance to the extent of $100,000 at least. The reference to the latter paragraph has nothing at all to do with \"augmenting\" the insurance beyond $100,000.\nAgain, it is to be observed that the notice which is dispensed with by para. 5 is notice with respect to \"any\" insurance, even though already in existence. As paras. 1 to 5 inclusive are not to be found in the standard printed portion of the policy but are specially typed-in clauses, it would be the merest chance that existing insurance at the time the appellant's policy was effected would be found to be of the same \"forme, teneur et port\u00e9e.\" This consideration alone is sufficient to show that the parties had no intention, when providing for renunciation of notice with respect to \"toute\" insurance, of using that word in any sense other than the word ordinarily bears, namely, that permission was granted to the assured to maintain \"any\" existing insurance, whether blanket or covering specific goods only, no matter what the form of the contract. It follows that the intention was the same with respect to subsequent insurance. It may be observed also at this point that the same considerations render inapt the first two possible meanings of the language of para. 1 set out above.\nMr. Campbell argues, however, that the respondent, by its act in effecting the respondent's policy, adopted the construction of the appellant's policy for which he contends. Mr. Campbell says that the respondent's policy was for the full value of the specific property to which it applied and that the assured thus recognized that the appellant's policy no longer applied to that property.\nIn considering this contention, it will be convenient to refer first to the other insurance effected by the assured on May 31, 1940, on specific property, namely, the policy for $3,000 in the Phoenix of London upon property loaned to the assured by a number of named firms for exhibition purposes. The actual loss with respect to this last-mentioned property due to the fire in question, which occurred on June 2, 1940, was $5,248.19. It would appear hardly likely that the assured, in effecting a policy for only $3,000 on this property, did so with the intention that he would thereby bring about a situation in which the policies of the appellant and the other members of the group would cease to attach to this property, thereby causing this property to be uninsured for over forty per cent of its value. I do not think, with respect, that it can be reasonably argued that the assured had any such intention, or that its intention was other than to provide, by the additional insurance, ample coverage in case the protection provided by the group policies should prove insufficient under any circumstances.\nIt is further to be observed that the Phoenix of London policy was for a term of sixteen days only, and it is hardly likely that it was contemplated there would be any change in the composition of the articles on exhibit during this period.\nWhen one comes to the situation under the respondent's policy, which was issued on February 22, 1940, within approximately two weeks of the appellant's policy, it is to be observed that it was to run for a period of three years, and while the face amount of the policy may have been the value at the date of its issue of the particular goods of that description which were actually on the premises at that time. The itemized list formed no part of the policy delivered to the assured, and the description of the property insured was not limited to particular items then on the premises, but was a coverage generally of\nmeubles faisant partie des collections du mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble.\nThese collections might run to much more or much less in value than $10,000 as the composition thereof might change from time to time within the three-year period. In these circumstances, I am unable, with respect, to see any ground upon which a court could be asked to find that the assured had \"adopted\" a construction of the appellant's policy which, for reasons already given, that policy cannot on its own language reasonably bear. It is further suggested that the permission granted by para. 5 may be restricted to additional insurance on the buildings only, and thus bring about a result under which the paragraph does not come in any way in conflict with the language of para. 1 with respect to contents. In my opinion, it is sufficient to say that para. 5 does not purport to be limited to additional insurance on buildings and the appellant does not so contend.\nAs to the suggestion that the \"montant total\" would be increased if specific insurance were placed on some items, with the result that the appellant's insurance remained on the remainder, this may be true enough, but the idea behind the paragraph is that if the permission is acted upon the result will be, in all cases, more protection for the assured, not less. The Phoenix of London policy affords a good example. When it was effected the total insurance on the contents became $103,000, but under the appellant's contention, the result was that $2,542 value became uninsured. Such a situation might well be aggravated if further insurance were placed on other specific goods. Moreover, had the Phoenix of London policy covered all the contents, instead of being limited to part only, the result, according to the argument of the appellant, would have been that the appellant and its group would have ceased to be on the risk, and the assured would have been left with $3,000 insurance only. To be consistent, Mr. Campbell was obliged to go, and did go, this far. Thus, in seeking to \"augment\" his total insurance with the permission granted by para. 5 so to do, the assured would have actually reduced his protection almost to the vanishing point. The parties might, of course, have so contracted, but only, in my view, by clear words not to be found at all in para. 5 as it stands. Such a result can, in my opinion, be reached only by reading into the paragraph words which are not there, in violation of the fundamental canon of construction applicable to a contract of this nature, namely, that it is to be construed contra proferentem.\nWith respect to the third of the possible meanings of the words \"autrement assur\u00e9\" set out above, paras. 2 and 3 of the appellant's policy are relevant. Under their provisions the insurance is to extend to everything belonging to the assured, as well as to goods which it has sold but not delivered and goods in its possession on consignment; or for repair or on any basis involving responsibility on the part of the assured for them. The insurance is also to cover goods bought on \"conditional sale\" contracts. In any of these situations where the assured would not have an absolute title, it might very well be that, in many instances, insurance would have been placed on the goods by the other persons interested in them, such as, for instance, by an unpaid vendor. It is not unusual in such circumstances for an unpaid vendor in his insurance to cover also the interest of the purchaser in the goods. An example of such a situation is afforded by the circumstances in Keefer v. Phoenix Ins. Co. 13.\nIt may very well have been in the contemplation of the parties in the case at bar that the appellant's policy should not apply in similar circumstances so as to oblige the appellant and the other members of the group to contribute in any way to indemnify the assured when its interest would be covered by such other insurance. This view of the language of para. 1 acquires additional strength from the fact that under para. 5 it is \"l'assur\u00e9e\" who is authorized to augment or diminish the total amount of \"ses assurances.\"\nThis is a reasonable construction of the language used, and when the policy is so construed all its provisions are brought into harmony. If for any reason, however, this is not the true view, the result, in my opinion, is that the ambiguous words to be found in para. 1 cannot stand with the clear language actually used in para. 5, and being repugnant thereto, they fall to the ground. It is impossible to write out of the policy the clear provisions of para. 5 or to amend it so as to give to the ambiguous words of para. 1 the meaning for which the appellant contends.\nThe insurance provided by the respondent's policy, therefore, being authorized by the terms of para. 5, it came within the words \"any other insurance on the property herein described\" (that is, described in the appellant's policy) in statutory condition 9, and the appellant is bound to contribute rateably with respect to the loss. The appellant next contends that the respondent was in any event not entitled to sue, as the \"subrogation\" in writing is signed only by the president of the assured, whereas the incorporating statute, 16 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 4, prescribes as follows:\nThe signatures of the president or of the vice-president and of the secretary-treasurer shall suffice in all legal matters of the corporation.\nAssuming that this contention is well taken, the Government of the Province of Quebec, to whom the loss is payable under the policy, is also a party, and the document as executed was authorized by Order in Council. In Guerin v. Manchester 14, it was held that a party to whom, as in the case at bar, loss under a fire insurance policy is payable, is entitled to sue and that this right of action may be assigned. In the case at bar, the provisions of Articles 1570 and 1571 of the Civil Code were met, so that the appellant is in a position to maintain its action claiming through the Government of the Province, regardless of any defect in his title as claiming through the assured; Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Ins. Co. 15. I think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014La Corporation des \u00c9coles Techniques ou Professionnelles, the insured, entered into contracts of insurance, identical in terms, with the appellant and several other companies on February 7, 1940, for a total insurance of $250,000, apportioned $150,000 upon the buildings and $100,000 on the contents. The appellant's share was $150,000.\nOn February 22, 1940, the insured entered into a contract of insurance with the respondent in the sum of $10,000 on the \"Objets d'Art et des meubles faisant partie des collections du mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole du Meuble, . . . .\" (hereinafter referred to as \"objets d'art\"). These were a part of the contents of the building and initially included under the appellant's policy.\nOn June 2, 1940, a fire occurred by which the insured suffered a total loss of $83,922.67 in respect of both buildings and contents. The loss of the \"objets d'art,\" etc., as insured by the respondent, totalled $7,070.53. The respondent paid the full amount and, as the appellant denied any liability to pay a pro rata share, this action is brought to recover that share in the sum of $1,939.85. If liability be found, the amount of $1,939.85 is not contested.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action. The majority of the Appellate Court 16, Mr. Justice St-Jacques and Mr. Justice Hyde dissenting, allowed the appeal.\nThe appellant's policy provided :\nL'on entendra\n1o par b\u00e2timents: les immeubles m\u00eames, leurs annexes et allonges communicantes, les couloirs reliant les b\u00e2timents, les chemin\u00e9es et le tunnel, et tout am\u00e9nagement fixe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n2\u00b0 par contenu: tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9. A titre indicatif seulement: l'ameublement, les livres, les \u0153uvres d'art, les objets ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s ou en voie d'ex\u00e9cution, . . . . les objets exclus par l'article 7 des conditions statutaires reproduites dans la police et, enfin, les effets et les choses appartenant aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves et aux professeurs.\nThe appellant contends that, by virtue of the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9,\" when the respondent placed its insurance on \"objets d'art\" these \"objets\" were no longer covered by its policy.\nThe respondent contends that appellant consented to this further insurance within the meaning of Statutory Conditions Nos. 8 and 9 and, therefore, the appellant and its co-insurers must pay a pro rata share of the loss; that, in so far as the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" be relied upon to prevent that result, they constitute a variation of Condition No. 9 which, not being endorsed on the policy in conspicuous type and in ink of different colour, as required by s. 241 of the Insurance Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 299), is not binding upon the insured.\nThe appellant's policy also provided:\nL'assur\u00e9e s'engage \u00e0 maintenir en vigueur une assurance de m\u00eames forme, teneur et port\u00e9e au montant total de $250,000, divis\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de $150,000 sur les b\u00e2timents et de $100,000 sur le contenu. Si elle ne se conforme pas \u00e0 cette convention, l'assur\u00e9e deviendra co-assureur pour le d\u00e9ficit.\nThis policy further provided:\nL'assur\u00e9e est autoris\u00e9e:\na) \u00e0 augmenter ou \u00e0 diminuer le montant total de ses assurances sans en avertir les assureurs; ceux-ci renoncent au pr\u00e9avis pour toute assurance souscrite ant\u00e9rieurement ou post\u00e9rieurement au pr\u00e9sent contrat. Cette pr\u00e9rogative ne lib\u00e9rera pas l'assur\u00e9e, cependant, de la convention relative au montant minimum d'assurance mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. The relevant paragraphs in the appellant's policy quoted above are, for convenience, hereinafter referred to as paras. 1, 2 and 3. The words \"b\u00e2timents\" and \"contenu,\" in the first paragraph, are described with such particularity as to leave no doubt but that they were prepared in a manner to justify the adoption of Lord Watson's view that they should be regarded as \"the deliberate act of both parties.\" Birrell v. Dryer 17.\nThe possibility of further insurance upon both buildings and contents, or either, was obviously present to the minds of the parties as they completed the contracts of insurance of which the appellant's is one. Only in relation to the contents did they adopt the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" and make them part of the sentence describing the subject matter and the peril insured. Though expressed in the past tense, the parties have construed these words as referring to insurance to be subsequently placed. As insurer, the appellant has so construed these words, at least from the moment this claim was made. That the insured so construed them from the outset is evidenced by the fact that within fifteen days after the appellant's policy became effective it insured the \"objets d'art\" up to their full insurable value. A few months later, May 31, 1940, the insured entered into a still further contract of insurance with the Phoenix Assurance Company, Limited of London, England, upon certain contents loaned to the institution. At the time the appellant's policy was taken out there was no other insurance upon the property. It should also be noted that the respondent has brought this action on the basis that these words applied to subsequent insurance and has so contended throughout this litigation.\nWhen the parties are in agreement as to the meaning of a provision, a court, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, should construe the document in accord therewith. Adolph Lumber Company v. Meadow Creek Lumber Company 18, Forbes v. Watt 19; Pollock on Contracts, 13th Ed., 373. On the basis of this construction, and leaving aside, for the moment, the respondent's contention, the position here is not unlike that where the steamer \"Baltic\" was insured against fire \"whilst running on the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation\" and when \"laid up in a place of safety during winter months from any extra hazardous building.\" The ship had been laid up for a period of approximately three years prior to the fire and it was held that in that circumstance the ship was not covered. Mr. Justice Sedgewick wrote the judgment of the Court and stated :\nThe stipulation in question is in no sense a condition but rather a description of the subject matter insured. It is descriptive of and has reference solely to the risk covered by the policy and not to the happening of an event which by the statutory conditions would render the policy void. The statute, therefore, does not apply.\nThe London Assurance Corporation v. The Great Northern Transit Company 20.\nWhere the policies insuring ten houses contained a provision \"while occcupied by . . . . as a dwelling-house,\" it was held that if, at the time of the loss, one of the houses was unoccupied or otherwise used, it was not covered.\nWhile vacant, as they were for many months prior to, and at the time of, the fire because of failure to rent them, the houses in respect of which it has been held that the plaintiffs cannot recover did not answer the description of the subject matter in the policy and were therefore not covered by the insurance.\nMr. Justice Anglin (later C.J.) in Ross v. Scottish Union and National Insurance Company 21.\nIn a fire insurance policy the words \"only while the premises are occupied as a private dwelling\" were held to be words of description. Riddell J.A. stated:\nUnless there is something in the policy itself or in the legislation to take the present out of the authority of the cases cited, the company have a perfect defence, as the building at the time of the fire was not \"occupied as a private dwelling,\" it was not occupied at all . . . . what is suggested as such is not a stipulation at all, it is part of the description of the property insured as the cases cited above conclusively compel us to hold.\nCooper v. Toronto Casualty Ins. Co. 22. See also Schmidt v. Home Insurance Co. 23.\nThe contract of insurance must describe the property and the risk or peril insured against. It was the \"Baltic,\" not at all times, but as described in the policy, that constituted the subject matter and the peril insured against. In the same manner it was the houses only while occupied. These are distinguishable from those cases where there is a description of the property and the peril and then, in the contract, a provision that the risk will be varied or altered by the failure on the part of the insured to maintain or observe an undertaking on its part. In W. Malcolm Mackay Company v. British America Assurance Company 24, the policy insuring lumber against loss or damage by fire contained the following clause:\nWarranted by the insured that a clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained between the property hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest and any sawmill or other special hazard.\nDuff J. (later C.J.) stated at p. 344:\nThe description embraces, I think, any lumber of the insured company so situated, and the clause in question cannot, I think, be read as importing merely a qualification of this description. I think it is a warranty against the presence of any of the lumber of the insured company within the prohibited space.\nSee also St. Paul Lumber Company, Limited v. British Crown Assurance Corporation, Limited 25; Fidelity-Phenix Fire Insurance Company of New York v. McPherson 26; Palatine Ins. Co. v. Gregory 27.\nParties are at liberty to select the subject matter and peril to be insured. In so far as the words chosen constitute a part of the description, they are not, under the foregoing authorities, a stipulation within the meaning of s. 240 of the Quebec Insurance Act. In appellant's policy, that portion of the description here in question reads:\npar contenu: tout ce qui se trouve dans les immeubles et qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9.\nThe last portion of this sentence is an essential part of the description and, as such, does not constitute a stipulation within the meaning of s. 240. In the Cooper case supra Mr. Justice Middleton expressed his disapproval of this distinction and suggested legislative action. Ontario thereafter amended its s. 106(1), corresponding to s. 240 of the Quebec Act, by adding thereto the words:\nnor shall anything contained in the description of the subject matter of the insurance be effective in so far as it is inconsistent with, varies, modifies or avoids such condition.\n1929 S. of O., c. 53, s. 12(1).\nThis amendment was considered in Renshaw v. Phoenix Insurance Company 28. Section 240 of the Quebec Act does not contain a provision similar in effect to that contained in the Ontario amendment of 1929.\nThe foregoing constitutes an answer to the respondent's contention which may be summarized as follows :\nThe contents of the buildings were insured from February 7th to February 22nd, 1940. On that day, additional insurance was placed on some of the contents, with the permission of the Defendant. Condition 8 had been complied with. So had condition 9, and \"on the happening of any loss or damage\", the Defendant is \"liable only for the payment of a rateable proportion of such loss or damage.\"\nWhen, on February 22, 1940, the respondent's policy became effective, the coverage under the appellant's policy upon the same contents was automatically removed. There never was a moment when the appellant's and respondent's policies covered the same contents. That was the position at the time of the loss and, therefore, the provisions of Conditions 8 and 9, which contemplate at the time of the loss an enforceable coverage of the same property, have no relevancy. Home Insurance Co. of New York v. Gavel 29.\nThe parties hereto do not agree as to the effect of the consent to further insurance provided for in para. 3. The appellant sought to restrict its meaning to only those policies which are \"de m\u00eames forme, teneur et port\u00e9e\" as its own. The respondent, however, contends that the provisions of para. 3 are sufficiently comprehensive to apply to its policy.\nThe respondent's view relative to the construction of para. 3 is more in accord with the language used. This para. 3 is phrased in rather general terms and the words \"le montant total de ses assurances\" do not suggest they are limited in their application to \"(le) montant total de $250,000\" in para. 2 and do not import into para. 3 the words \"de m\u00eames forme, teneur et port\u00e9e\" from para. 2. The language of para. 3 appears sufficiently comprehensive to cover the appellant's consent to respondent's policy.\nIf, however, we assume, as the respondent contends, that the appellant, by virtue of para. 3, consented to the former's policy, that does not alter the position. The language of both policies, including the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9,\" notwithstanding the consent, remains the same. In the result, the consent, in relation to respondent's policy, is of no effect and may be looked upon as surplus. This construction does not involve any repugnancy between paras. 1 and 3. Even if these paragraphs be construed in a manner that recognizes some repugnancy, that construction should be avoided, if reasonably possible. Here the language of para. 1 is specific, while that of para. 3 is general. If the general terms of the latter be construed not to apply to the words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9,\" thereby avoiding the suggested repugnancy, that should be done, particularly if consistent with the intention of the parties as disclosed in relation to the contract as a whole. As stated in the oft-quoted maxim of Bacon, Rule 10:\nfor all words, whether they be in deeds or statutes, or otherwise, if they be general and not express and precise, shall be restrained unto the fitness of the matter or person.\nMoreover, the parties to a contract must be presumed to have attributed a meaning and purpose to its several parts which, when read together, constitute a complete consistent contract and, therefore, repugnancy should be, if reasonably possible, avoided.\nThis construction, which so limits the general words of para. 3, appears to be most in accord with the intention of the parties, as it would appear they never intended, by this general provision, to contradict the specific words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9.\" Moreover, this construction does not nullify nor indeed eliminate the necessity for para. 3. The parties, as they completed appellant's contract, would contemplate other insurance in general which would include other policies on the buildings only, or upon the buildings and contents, in language identical to that of the appellant, or otherwise. It is clear that the consent in para. 3 would have meaning and effect as to some of these and it is unnecessary here to construe its precise effect in relation to all of them. It is sufficient to observe its effect in relation to the respondent's policy in question in this litigation.\nIt should be noted that under the appellant's policy the total coverage throughout remained the same. When the respondent's policy became effective it alone covered the contents therein specified, but, by virtue of the appellant's policy remaining in total the same, there was a larger coverage upon the contents.\nThe policy with the Phoenix Assurance Company, Limited of London, England, placed by the insured on certain borrowed chattels was not equal to the full insurable value of this borrowed property. It was the right of the insured to place such amount thereon as it might decide and no conclusion can be drawn therefrom such as in the respondent's policy, which covered the specified contents up to their full insurable value. The appellant did make an ex gratia payment on account of the loss suffered by the insured, but neither this nor the foregoing circumstance is of assistance in determining the issues raised in this litigation.\nThe words \"qui n'est pas autrement assur\u00e9\" are a part of the sentence describing the subject matter and peril insured. They limit or qualify that subject matter or peril, but are nevertheless a part of the description. They are not, in this policy, a stipulation contrary to any provision, or any variation, addition or omission to Statutory Conditions 8 and 9 within the meaning of s. 240 of the Quebec Insurance Act.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brais, Campbell & Mercier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena & Hackett.\n1 Q.R.

The latter company accumulated substantial profits from the date of purchase until 1944 when Timberland sold the shares to its own shareholders in proportion to their holdings at $100 per share. In 1945 the shareholders disposed of the shares at $750 each. The appellant having been assessed for the year 1944 on the estimated market value of the Salmon River Logging Co. shares, less the cost of the shares to him, as a dividend deemed to have been received from Timberland, appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada which affirmed the assessment.\nHeld: 1. The difference between the price paid to Timberland by its shareholders for the Salmon River shares and their true value was an annual net profit or gain in the sense of being a dividend or profit directly received from stocks within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Income War Tax Act.\n2. The shares sold were not an accretion of capital but a dividend paid in money's worth and represented taxable income. Pool v. The Guardian Investment Trust Co. [1922] A.C. 347, approved in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fisher's Executors, [1926] A.C. 395 at 403; Weight v. Salmon, 19 T.C. 174 at 193, 194.\n3. It was a profit in 1944 when the money's worth was received and not in 1945 when the shares were sold. It was an immediate distribution of profits and not a declaration of a distribution payable at some subsequent time.\n4. On all the evidence the value of $600 per share as found by the trial judge was a fair and just figure.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1951] Ex. C.R. 201, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1 Sidney Smith J., Deputy Judge, affirming an assessment made against the appellant under the Income War Tax Act for the year 1944. J. L. Lawrence for the appellant. The 580 shares did not have a value in excess of $580,000 but if so the excess value was not a dividend or deemed to be a dividend under the Income War Tax Act. Such excess value was not income of the appellant under s. 3 of the Act or under any other provision of the Act and in any event no income in respect thereto was received by the appellant in 1944. The object of the sale by Timberland was to secure needed funds and not to distribute profits and was a bona fide sale. None of the reasons given by the appellant for the sale to its shareholders were contradicted in evidence and the trial judge made no finding of fraud or dishonesty. The Court should not submit its judgment for the judgment of businessmen in business matters. Hirsche v. Sims 2. Timberland is a separate legal entity from its shareholders and the sale should be considered as a contract between independent parties. Salomon v. Salomon & Co. 3; Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue 4.\nThe shares of Salmon River held by Timberland were a capital asset of Timberland. The shares were purchased to give an enduring benefit to Timberland. Any profit made on the sale of the shares would not be income of Timberland. British Insulated & Helsby Cables v. Atherton 5 ; Minister National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. 6; Southern v. Borax Consolidated Ltd. 7.\nCapital is not defined in the Income War Tax Act but if an asset does not come under the head of inventory, that is the property in which a company trades, then for all the purposes of the Act it should be treated as capital. In England capital invested in inventory is called circulating capital as opposed to fixed capital. Shaw and Baker \"The law of Income Tax\" 1937, p. 154; Inland Revenue Commsr. v. Blott 8. The attitude of Parliament towards the sale by a company of its assets to its shareholders is shown in s. 32B of the Income War Tax Act. The respondent has made no attempt to rely on this section and the reason is obvious because the sale of the shares of Salmon River by Timberland would not create income of Timberland. If s. 3 is to be interpreted as found by the trial judge then s. 32B is unnecessary and that would not logically follow since Parliament is presumed to know the law. Queen v. Walford 9 ; Young & Co. v. Mayor of Royal Leamington Spa 10. The inclusion in s. 32B of the words \"which assets if sold at the market price would create income of the corporation within the meaning of this Act\" clearly indicate that only where a corporation receives or would receive income can a shareholder be deemed to receive a dividend. This is a step beyond the provisions of s. 3 and obviously it is as far as Parliament intended to go. The trial judge has gone far beyond s. 32B in holding that similar provisions should apply in every sale by a corporation of assets to its shareholders whether or not such sale would create income of the corporation.\nA company is not competent to declare a dividend except in accordance with its authorized procedure. Bouch v. Sproule 11. The extract from the Articles of Association as filed requires a recommendation by the directors and a declaration by the company in general meeting in order to declare a dividend. This was not done. What the company declares a certain translation to be that it is; if it declares it to be a dividend then it is a dividend; if it declares it to be a sale it is a sale and not a dividend. Commsr. of Inland Revenue v. Blott 12 ; Commsr. of Inland Revenue v. Fishers Executors 13.\nThe resolutions of Timberland were for a sale only and were approved by Salmon River and by Green Point only on that basis. The real and only purpose was to effect a sale and this would be so even though the shares were sold at an under-valuation and even though the shareholders contemplated a benefit to themselves as well as Timberland.\nS. 3 must be strictly construed. The relevant words apply to a dividend not to a sale. If Parliament had intended s. 3 to apply to a transaction such as this it would have enacted legislation such as is found in s. 8 (1). Under that section the sale might attract taxation yet that section does not declare the transaction to be a dividend or even presumed to be a dividend. No such words appear in the Act as it existed in 1944 and should not be read into the Act. Parkington v. A.-G. 14; Brooks v. Commsr. of Inland Revenue 15; Canadian Eagle Oil Co. v. The King 16; Taplin v. Commsr. of Internal Revenue 17.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent.\nThe appellant received the profit arising from the purchase of the Salmon River shares as a shareholder of Timberland and as a profit from his Timberland shares even though the profit arose out of a sale transaction and was received as a free distribution. Weight v. Salmon 18; Ede v. Wilson and Cornwall 19. He received the profits arising from the purchase in the year he purchased the shares. Gold Coast Selection Trust v. Humphrey 20.\nThe profit received by the appellant was properly included in computing his income for the 1944 taxation year by virtue of s. 3 as being a dividend or profit directly or indirectly received in the year from stocks or other investments, Commsr. of Inland Revenue v. Blott 21, and the amount of the profit as fixed by the Minister and trial judge is justified on the evidence.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014This appeal is concerned with the assessment to income tax of the appellant under the Income War Tax Act in the year 1944. I agree with the reasons for judgment of the trial judge except that I find no occasion to consider any of the decisions in the Courts of the United States referred to by him.\nHis findings of fact are the only possible ones on the evidence. The appellant was the President and Managing Director of Timberland Lumber Co. Ltd., and its principal shareholder. That company had obtained 100 shares, at $100 each, of Salmon River Logging Company Limited, which latter had profits after payment of taxes in each of the years 1938 to 1943 inclusive, of various amounts ranging from about $65,000 to about $126,000. Timber- land held earned profits and the object of its shareholders, including the appellant, was to distribute those profits. This is made quite clear from the company's annual statements and the letters to the Income Tax Inspector from the firm that acted as auditors of that company and also of the Salmon River Company. These letters also show that originally it was the intention to declare a dividend of the Salmon River shares to the shareholders of Timberland. What was finally done was that Timberland sold to its shareholders, in proportion to their holdings, the Salmon River shares at $100 per share. The shareholders, including the appellant, thus secured shares that represented profits and which profits had never been capitalized by Timberland.\nUpon these facts the case falls within subsection 1 of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act because the difference between the price paid to Timberland by its shareholders of $100 for each share of the Salmon River Company and the true value was an annual net profit or gain in the sense of being a dividend or profit directly or indirectly received from stocks within that part of subsection 1 of s. 3 of the Act, reading as follows:\u2014\nand shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source.\nMr. Lawrence suggested that this should be read:\u2014 \"The interest * * * received from money at interest upon any security or without security * * * dividends from stocks * * * profits from any other investment.\" This, however, is not the correct interpretation as what is included is: (a) the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security: and (b) the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from stocks or from any other investment. The same construction results from a consideration of the French version of the text:\u2014\net doit comprendre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, les dividendes ou profits directement ou indirectement re\u00e7us de fonds plac\u00e9s \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat sur toutes valeurs ou sans garantie, ou d'actions, ou de tout autre placement, et, que ces gains ou profits soient partag\u00e9s ou distribu\u00e9s ou non, et aussi les profits ou gaina annuels d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de toute autre source, y compris. The distribution of the shares by Timberland was not a distribution of capital of that company. As the correspondence and the balance sheets of Timberland show, those shares were not an accretion of capital but were a dividend paid in money's worth and represented taxable income: Pool v. The Guardian Investment Trust Co. 22, a decision of Sankey J., as he then was, approved, although distinguished, in Commissioners. of Inland Revenue v. Fisher's Executors 23, by Viscount Cave, at 403, with the concurrence of Lord Atkinson. Here, as in the Pool case, the distributing company distributed, not shares in its own stock, but shares in the stock of another company. The fact that the shares were not freely distributed but were purchased at $100 per share means only that each shareholder, including the appellant, was receiving a profit to the extent of the difference between the price he could get for it and the price he had actually paid: Weight v. Salmon 24, at pp. 193, 194, per Lord Atkin, with whom all the other peers agreed. Furthermore, it was a profit in 1944 when the money's worth was received and not in 1945 when each share was sold for $750. It was an immediate distribution of profits and not a declaration of a distribution payable at some subsequent time such as was found in Associated Insulation Products Ltd. v. Golder 25.\nOn the evidence the true value was properly fixed by the trial judge at $600 per share in 1944. The appellant called as a witness Mr. J. C. Wilson, a member of the firm of auditors that acted for both companies. He fixed the value at $113 per share but, as the trial judge points out, the letter of June 20, 1944, from Mr. Wilson's firm to the Income Tax Inspector disagrees with his view at the trial that in 1944 the outlook for Salmon River was a poor one, since that letter states: \"It appears that Salmon River will accumulate funds fairly rapidly from now on.\" The trial judge, therefore, declined to accept Mr. Wilson's estimate and with that conclusion I agree. Mr. Beer, called on behalf of the respondent, put the book value at approximately $400 with the value computed on earnings at something more, and he testified that in arriving at that figure he had made no allowance for wartime appreciation in fixed assets due to rising prices. On all the evidence $600 per share is a fair and just figure and the appellant is liable to income tax imposed upon the difference between that amount and the sum of $100 paid by the appellant on his purchase from Timberland of each share of Salmon River.\nIn this view of the matter, I find it unnecessary to deal with the respondent's contention that section 18 of the Act also applies. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The investment by the Timberland Company in the Salmon River Company was made from funds representing accumulated profits; and if the shares so obtained had been distributed among the shareholders of Timberland there can be no doubt that they would have been income within the meaning of s. 3 of The Income War Tax Act as \"dividends or profits directly or indirectly received .... from stocks\". In Pool v. The Guardian Inv. Company 26, such a distribution took place and the judgment of Sankey J. (as he was) was approved by Cave L.C. in I.R. v. Fisher's Ex. 27; and I.R.C. v. Reid's Trustees 28, shows that \"dividends\" are taxable regardless of the nature of the fund out of which they are paid.\nBut such a distribution can be made under the guise of a sale, and here Smith J. has found that to have taken place. Shares purchased originally by Timberland for $100 each were, seven years later, made the subject of an agreement purporting to sell them to the shareholders of Timberland for the same price. One year still later, they were disposed of by the shareholders for $750 each. Those striking facts were buttressed by the frank disclosure of the desire to make a distribution of the shares, as to the mode of which the advice of the Income Department was sought; and I agree with Smith J. that the form adopted was simply what was thought to be a means of avoiding the taxation consequences of declaring a dividend. The remaining question is of the value of the shares found, namely, $600 when they were received. In this, Smith J. has, I think, dealt carefully and thoroughly with all relevant factors, and I am quite unable to say that his conclusion was unwarranted or indeed that it was not dictated by what was before him.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.L.

Act, 1867, s. 92(2).\nBy virtue of the Mineral Taxation Act, 1948, c. 24 and amendments, the Province of Saskatchewan purported to impose an annual tax on each owner of minerals within the Province regardless of whether minerals were or were not present within, upon or under the land. \"Owner\" was defined as a person registered in a land title office as the owner of any minerals. \"Mineral\" means the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land.\nThe Act provided that in a \"non producing area\", the tax would be at the rate of 3 cents per acre of land. The Lieutenant-Governor was given the power to declare any area in the province a \"producing area\", and provision was made for the assessment at their fair value of minerals in a producing area. Until an assessment was made the owner was liable to pay at the rate of 50 cents per acre of land and fraction thereof in such an area. Following an assessment, the owner would be liable to pay a tax at the rate prescribed from time to time by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council but not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value of the minerals. Non-payment of the tax resulted in forfeiture of the minerals to the Crown. The trial judge held that the Act was intra vires as imposing direct taxation. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan held that the 3 cent tax was a direct tax, but that the 50 cent tax and the mill rate tax were indirect.\nHeld (the Chief Justice dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nEach of the three taxes is a land tax, is clearly direct taxation and not imposed with the intention that it should be passed on to someone else.\nCity of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate [1928] A.C. 117; A.G. for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry. Co. [1950] A.C. 87; A.G. for B.C. v. C.P.R. [1927] A.C. 934; A.G. for Manitoba v. A.G. for Canada [1925] A.C. 561 and Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips [1904] A.C. 405 referred to.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 which had reversed the judgment of the trial judge and had declared the Act ultra vires in part.\nE. C. Leslie, I. D. Sinclair and Allan Findlay for appellants. The Act is not in pith and substance in relation to direct taxation and is therefore beyond provincial competence. The tax is imposed upon the owner in respect of mineral rights and in respect of the minerals themselves. A tax thus imposed is analogous to a tax on the producer of a commodity in respect of a commodity and such a tax is indirect taxation: Bank of Toronto v. Lambe. 2; The Security Export Co. v. Hetherington 3. It appears from the reasoning in the judgment of Caledonian Collieries v. The King 4 that had the tax been imposed in respect of the coal before its sale or while it was still in the ground, there could have been no question that it would be an indirect tax because an allowance would be made for such a tax in the price charged. This view is also supported by the case of Esquimalt 5 in this Court. And in the Privy Council 6 it would have been quite unnecessary for Lord Greene to have drawn the careful distinction he did between a land tax and a tax on standing timber if a tax on standing timber was regarded as a direct tax. If a tax in respect of minerals which have been removed is an indirect tax, a tax in respect of the right to remove the minerals is also an indirect tax, because here also, an allowance would be made for the tax in the price of sale.\nThe validity of the submission that the tax is direct because it will not in fact be passed on will disappear when the operation of the legislation is examined. But the fact that it may not be possible in a given case to pass it on does not effect the general tendency of the tax on mineral rights which is that it will be passed on. The legislature contemplated that this would be its normal effect and tendency. The Security Export Co. v. Hetherington (supra), Esquimalt (supra), Grain Futures Case 7; The A.G. for British Columbia v. C.P.R. 8; The A.G. for Manitoba v. The A.G. for Canada 9 and the City of Charlottetoion v. Foundation Maritime Limited 10. This is not as contended, a land tax within the case of City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate 11.\nThe interest in land in respect of which the tax in question is imposed is the right to extract or produce from the land a commodity which will be the subject of commercial transactions. Such an interest in land cannot be considered as falling within the well recognized class of land taxes that have always been regarded as direct taxes. The situation here is analogous with the tax on growing crops of the Agricultural Land Relief Act case 12.\nLicenses which have been held to be a tax may be supported under section 92 para. 9 even though it be an indirect tax: Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit 13 and Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board 14.\nThe provisions imposing the 3 cent rate are not severable and accordingly if the two other rates are ultra vires, the entire enactment is ultra vires. It is apparent from a consideration of the Act as a whole that it was intended to work out a single comprehensive scheme of taxation. If parts of it are invalid, the remaining parts cannot stand unless it can be assumed that the legislature would have enacted such remaining parts without the invalid parts and the converse is true. The A.G. for Alberta v. The A.G. for Canada 15; The A.G. for Manitoba v. The A.G. for Canada 16 and The A.G. for British Columbia v. The A.G. for Canada 17..\nM. C. Shumiatcher, Q.C. for the respondent, Minister of Natural Resources. The Act is clearly a taxing statute intended to raise a revenue for the purposes of the province. The tax is imposed with respect to property or alternatively, the tax is imposed upon property. The cases of Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips 18, Macpherson v. Temiskaming 19, Clarkson v. Bouchard 20 and Gowan v. Christie 21 are relied on.\nMinerals being land or an interest in land, a mineral tax of the type here imposed is not new or unusual. Mineral rights have been the subject of taxation for a considerable number of years in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia. The impost under the Act in pith and substance constitutes direct taxation. There is no relation between the tax and the amount of product produced, therefore it cannot be a tax on a commodity. The tax is on capital, i.e. the value of the land. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe 22. The effect of the judgment in City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate 23 is that a tax upon land and interests in land is a direct tax. The situation here is somewhat similar to the Brewers Case 24. There is a difference between a growing crop and minerals, the time limit being so short in the crop case as to be immaterial. The tax is directed at the crop which is a chattel in contemplation of severance. Timber and minerals are an interest in the land. The crops, whether growing or not, are chattels. The fact that the tax or a portion thereof may be said to be passed on in no way alters the fact that, being a tax upon property or an interest in property, it is direct taxation. The A.G. for British Columbia v. King come Navigation Co. Ltd. 25; The King v. Caledonian Collieries Ltd. 26 and the Agricultural Land Relief Act case 27. There is no such tendency as in the case of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime Ltd. 28 inherent in the provisions of the present statute since there exists no relationship between the tax and the marketable commodity. The Mineral Tax Act provides for a levy upon or in respect of the land and contemplates payment by the owner of that land. No passing on is contemplated. Furthermore, if the tax was a direct tax when set at 1 cent per acre, it did not become an indirect tax when it was increased to 3 cents per acre. The nature of a tax does not alter with its quantum.\nThe acreage tax in R. M. Bratts v. Hudson's Bay Co. 29 was held to be a direct tax. The cases of Rattenbury v. Land Settlement Board 30 and the City of Montreal v. The A.G. for Canada 31 are also of assistance.\nP. G. Makaroff, Q.C. for the respondent, the A.G. for Saskatchewan. The tax is taken directly from the registered owner of minerals apparently for the reasonable purpose of getting contributions for provincial purposes from those who are making or stand to make profits from the ownership of mineral rights. The difference in the three taxes is not in character but only in the method of assessment. The validity of a taxing statute is not affected by the method of assessment.\nThere is a presumption at law that the legislature has not exceeded its power.\nThe principles of severability are well known and reference is made to Toronto v. York Township 32 and the Rattenbury case 30. If there is any doubt as to the constitutional validity of any one of the procedures adopted or capable of adoption and application, such is clearly severable in the event that one procedure is held to be ultra vires, that provision ought to be severed from the balance of the statute which, read as a whole, is a taxing statute imposing direct taxation in the province. As the 3 cent tax is a blanket tax over the whole of the province, the two other taxes may be taken away and the Act will still be complete. The legislature would have enacted the Act just for the 3 cent tax. J. J. Frawley, Q.C. for the Intervenant, the A.G. for Alberta, adopted the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014The appellants sought to have the Minerals Taxation Acts and Amendments of the Province of Saskatchewan declared ultra vires. There were other conclusions in their statement of claim and some of them were passed upon by the Court of Appeal of the Province of Saskatchewan 33, but before this Court the only point discussed was whether the tax imposed ought to be classed as an indirect tax and, therefore, outside the powers of the Legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe task of deciding the point, to my mind, is not an easy one. In City of Halifax v. Estate of J. P. Fairbanks 34, Viscount Cave, delivering the judgment of their Lordships of the Privy Council, insisted upon the fact that in considering the question raised it was important to bear in mind that the problem to be solved was one of law and that the framers of the British North America Act evidently regarded taxes as divisible into two separate and distinct categories\u2014namely, those that are direct and those which cannot be so described. From this he inferred that the distinction between direct and indirect taxation was well known before the passing of the British North America Act and, he says, it is undoubtedly the fact that before that date the classification was familiar to statemen as well as to economists, and that certain taxes were then universally recognized as falling within one or the other category. Viscount Cave stated that the well known formula of John Stuart Mill no doubt was valuable as providing a logical basis for the distinction already established between direct and indirect taxes, and perhaps also as a guide for determining as to any new or unfamiliar tax which may be imposed in which of the two categories it is to be placed.\nThat judgment was handed down in 1928, but the Judicial Committee in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Rly. Co. 35 said this about Viscount Cave's judgment in the Fairbanks case:\u2014\nLord Cave, in delivering the judgment of the Board, used expressions which, if not correctly understood, might appear to lay down too rigid a test for the classification of taxes; but, as is pointed out by Lord Simon L.C. in the judgment of the Board in the later case of Atlantic Smoke Shops, Ltd. v. Cordon (1943) A.C. 550, those expressions \"should not be understood as relieving the courts from the obligation of examining the real nature and effect of the particular tax in the present instance, or as justifying the classification of the tax as indirect merely because it is in some sense associated with the purchase of an article\".\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe 36, Lord Hobhouse, delivering the judgment of the Board, made some useful observations as to the mode in which the question should be approached, and stated that the drafters of the British North America Act \"must have contemplated some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies\".\nThis language was approved by the Board in The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Ltd. 37.\nIn view of these pronouncements of the Judicial Committee, I feel that Lord Cave's suggested classifications should not be strictly adhered to.\nIn City of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime, Ltd. 38, this Court said:\u2014\nThe question of \"direct taxation\" as defining the sphere of provincial legislation has often been the subject of pronouncements by this Court and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The effect of the decisions, when analyzed, is substantially as follows:\nIn every case, the first requisite is to ascertain the inherent character of the tax, whether it is in its nature a direct tax within the meaning of section 92, head 2, of the British North America Act, 1867 (Attorney General for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co. Ltd. (1930) A.C. 357 at 363 and 364). The problem is primarily one of law; and the Act is to be construed according to the ordinary canons of construction: the court must ascertain the intention of Parliament when it made the broad distinction between direct and indirect taxation.\nThese taxes (in 1867) had come to be placed respectively in the category of direct or indirect taxes according to some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by their general tendencies.\nAs applied, however, to taxes outside these well recognized classifications, the meaning of the words \"direct taxation\", as used in the Act, is to be gathered from the common understanding of these words which prevailed among the economists who had treated such subjects before the Act was passed (Attorney General for Quebec v. Reed (1884) 10 A.C. 141 at 143) ; and it is no longer open to discussion, on account of the successive decisions of the Privy Council, that the formula of John Stuart Mill (Political Economy ed. 1886, vol. 11, p. 415) has been judicially adopted as affording a guide to the application of section 92, head 2. Mill's definition was held to embody \"the most obvious indicia of \"direct and indirect taxation\" and was accepted as providing a logical basis for the distinction to be made between the two. The expression \"indirect taxation\" connotes the idea of a tax imposed on a person who is not supposed to bear it himself but who will seek to recover it in the price charged to another. And Mill's canon is founded on the theory of the ultimate incidence of the tax, not the ultimate incidence depending upon the special circumstances of individual cases, but the incidence of the tax in its ordinary and normal operation. It may be possible in particular cases to shift the burden of a direct tax, or it may happen, in particular circumstances, that it might be economically undesirable or practically impossible to pass it on (The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., (1928) A.C. 358). It is the normal or general tendency of the tax that will determine, and the expectation or the intention that the person from whom the tax is demanded shall indemnify himself at the expense of another might be inferred from the form in which the tax is imposed or from the results which in the ordinary course of business transactions must be held to have been contemplated.\nIn the present case there are really only two sections of The Mineral Taxation Act (Chapter 24 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1948, as amended by Chapter 23 of the Statutes of 1949 and Chapter 22 of the Statutes of 1950) which have to be considered. These are section 3 imposing a tax at the rate of three cents for every acre on \"every owner of minerals\" \u2026 \"not situated within the producing area\", and section 22 imposing a tax at the rate of fifty cents for every acre of land on the \"owner of minerals within, upon or under any land situated within a producing area\".\nBy force of section 5 of the Act \"producing areas\" are those which are so declared by order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and the latter may designate the mineral or minerals in respect of which the portion of the province therein described is constituted a \"producing area\". For those areas so designated assessors are provided to assess \"at their fair value all minerals, within, upon or under any parcel of land so constituted\". They prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out as accurately as may be a brief description of each such parcel of land, a brief description of the minerals assessed, the names and addresses of the owners of the minerals and the assessed value thereof.\nSection 7 deals with the method of assessment and section 6, dealing with the imposition of the tax, states:\nEvery owner whose name appears on the assessment roll mentioned in section 7 shall be liable for and shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year pay to the minister a tax at such rate as the Lieutenant Governor in Council may from time to time prescribe not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value of his minerals as shown on the assessment roll subject to any changes made on appeal.\nWe were told that so far no assessment has been made under these sections and we need not trouble ourselves with the question as to how the assessors are to arrive at the \"fair value\" of minerals which are within, upon or under the land and, indeed, which may not exist at all, for, it should be mentioned, that apparently the Act is to apply whether there are or are not minerals within, upon or under the land.\nWhat we have to consider for the purpose of this appeal is, therefore: What is the true nature of the tax imposed under section 3 or under section 22 of the Act, the first applying to every owner at the rate of three cents for every acre, and the second to the owners of minerals, within a producing area, at the rate of fifty cents for every acre of land in respect of which they are such owners? Of course, we are not concerned about the question of how the Act may be made to work, or even whether it is workable at all. The only point is whether it is ultra vires of the Legislature of Saskatchewan. The answer to be given is not helped by the definition of the word \"mineral\" in the Act. Subsection 4 of section 2 is as follows:\u2014\n\"Mineral\" means the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land \u2026\nThen there are certain exceptions with which we need not concern ourselves for the purpose of the present decision.\nThe peculiarity of that definition is:\n(1) It comprises an incorporeal right and a corporeal thing, to wit, the right to work, win and carry away minerals and also the mineral itself.\n(2) It proceeds to define \"mineral\" by the same word.\nWe are told that \"mineral\" is a \"mineral\" and while one might say that such a definition is clearly insufficient, it might also be pointed out that defining a word by the same word is hardly a way of indicating the meaning of the word.\nOn the other hand, the word \"land\" is not defined in the Act and I fail to see how, for the purpose of knowing what the Legislature had in mind, we may go to some other statute where that word may be defined. In the latter case the definition is evidently that given as usual for the purpose of that particular Act and it may not be imported into The Mineral Tax Act of 1948. It does not matter that the \"certificate of title\" as set out in subsection 2 of section 2 is stated to mean \"a certificate of title granted pursuant to the provisions of The Land Titles Act\". We are asked to say that the tax provided for by the legislation which is the subject of the appeal is a tax on land, and when \"land\" is not defined in the statute under consideration it seems to me to be contrary to the usual canons of construction to look for the meaning of the word \"land\" in a different statute.\nHere we are dealing with The Mineral Tax Act, 1948, and, therefore, with taxation on minerals. The least that we can say is that the attempt to tax a right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, is certainly a tax which, at the time of Confederation, could not find its place in the two categories of taxation spoken of in the Fairbanks case; and from all points of view it should be considered as a new species of taxation, sufficient to satisfy Viscount Cave in the Fairbanks case and obliging the Court to apply the Mill's formula \"as a guide for determining as to any new or unfamiliar tax which may be imposed in which of the two categories it is to be placed\" (City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate 39). It is clearly a tax which does not belong to the \"established classification of the old and well known species of taxation\" and which \"makes it necessary to apply a new test to every particular member of those species\".\nWe are not called upon here to transfer a tax universally recognized as belonging to one class to a different class of taxation in accordance with the Mill's formula. It is undoubtedly a new form of taxation, the nature of which must be ascertained in order to decide whether it is direct or indirect.\nAs I said before, the obvious intention of the Act is to tax minerals. Not only must we gather this from the title of the Act itself, but from its whole purport. Of course, the owner of the minerals is taxed and that is in accordance with the observations of Lord Thankerton in Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr 40, where he says:\u2014\nGenerally speaking, taxation is imposed on persons, the nature and amount of the liability being determined either by individual units, as in the case of a poll tax, or in respect of the taxpayers' interests in property or in respect of transactions or actings of the taxpayer. It is at least unusual to find a tax imposed on property and not on persons \u2026\nBut it is clear from the Act that the subject matter of the tax is not the person of the owner, but the minerals and, in the circumstances, I find some difficulty in assimilating the tax with which we are concerned to a tax on land. With respect, I repeat that we cannot, for that purpose, look for the definition of the word \"land\" in some other statute. The Mineral Tax Act does describe the words \"parcel of land\", but the definition there given applies to a different subject.\nIf it is correct to look at the tax as a tax on minerals and not as a tax on land, then it cannot be taken as belonging to the obvious category of direct taxation; and the nature of the tax is rather to be assimilated to what was under consideration in the Caledonian Collieries case supra. Indeed, as it happened in that case, coal was the subject matter of the tax, and both in this Court and in the Judicial Committee the tax was considered to apply to a commodity and to the sale of that commodity. At p. 362 of the judgment of the Privy Council it is stated :\u2014\nTheir Lordships can have no doubt that the general tendency of a tax upon the sums received from the sale of the commodity which they produce and in which they deal is that they would seek to recover it in the price charged to a purchaser. Under particular circumstances the recovery of the tax may, it is true, be economically undesirable or practically impossible, but the general tendency of the tax remains.\nMuch reliance was placed by the respondents on the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co. 41. I may say that I am not at all embarrassed by the decision of the Judicial Committee in that appeal. First, it must be remembered that that judgment was given on a reference and it has been invariably stated that judgments on references are not necessarily binding, because in a concrete case the circumstances might alter the general application of the principle laid down in such judgments; and, secondly, in the Nanaimo case the reference was not made on existing legislation, but the question was only whether the proposed legislation might be adopted by the Legislature of British Columbia along the lines of the report of Chief Justice Sloan. As to that Lord Greene had this to say at p. 114:\u2014\nIn construing questions of this nature, which do not purport to give more than an outline of the proposed legislation, the method applicable in construing a statute must not, in their Lordships' opinion, be too rigidly applied. In the completed legislation many sections of an explanatory or machinery nature would be included. Ambiguities would be cleared up, gaps would be filled, and it may often be necessary in construing what is no more than a \"projet de loi\" to assume a reasonable intention in that regard on the part of the legislature.\nAnd at p. 113 Lord Greene repeated:\u2014\nThe answer to the question whether the tax is or is not a direct tax is to be found in their opinion primarily by an examination of the nature and effect of the tax as collected from the language describing it.\nMoreover, the Nanaimo judgment insists upon the fact that the judicial committee is there dealing with what was undoubtedly a tax on land:\u2014\nIt will be the owner of the land and not the owner of the timber who will be liable to the Crown for the tax.\n(p. 116).\nThe conclusion, therefore, at which their Lordships have arrived is that the tax is in reality a tax on land and not a timber tax.\n(p. 118).\nThis case, in their Lordships view, affords a good example of the caution with which the \"pith and substance\" principle ought to be applied. The object of that principle is to discover what the tax really is; it must not be used for the purpose of holding that what is really a direct tax is an indirect tax on the ground that an equivalent result could have been obtained by using the technique of indirect taxation. The use of the word \"camouflage\" in the argument of the respondents appears to their Lordships to be due to a misapplication of the principle.\n(p. 120).\nIt will be seen, therefore that the foundation of the judgment in the Nanaimo case was that their Lordships came to the conclusion that it was the land which was to be assessed and that the tax was imposed on the land; and they quoted from the judgment of O'Halloran J.A., who dissented in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, as follows:\u2014\nBecause land bears a tax which is measured by the reflected value of its products is no reason to say that the tax on the land is a colourable tax on its products, and that such a tax is not in truth a tax on the land itself.\nAll that was said because the contention on behalf of the respondent, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Rly. Co.\u2014a contention which found favour in this Court 42, was that it was in reality a tax on timber and not a tax on land. On the contrary, in the present case there is no question of taxing the land. The acreage tax under section 3 is upon the owner of minerals and not upon the owner of land, and so it is under section 5 and still more so under sections 6 and 7, because what the assessor is to ascertain is the \"fair value of all minerals within, upon or under any parcel of land situated within a producing area\". The assessor is to give a \"brief description of the minerals assessed\"; and the tax prescribed by section 6, if the occasion should occur, is to be at a certain rate \"not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value of his minerals as shown on the assessment roll\". Then, if we turn to section 22, we find that \"every owner of minerals . . . . shall be liable for and shall, on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year in which such minerals have not been assessed under the provisions of this Act, pay to the minister a tax at the rate of fifty cents for every acre and every fraction of an acre of such land in respect of which he is such owner\". This remark is strengthened by the very definite definition of the word \"mineral\" in subsection 4 of section 2, where it is stated to mean \"the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land . . . .\"\nI would think that it is significant that the Act itself does not give any definition of the word \"land\". It is to the \"minerals\" and not to the \"land\" that the Act is directed. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the present case is distinguishable from the Nanaimo judgment and, on the contrary, falls within the Caledonian Collieries judgment. If that be so, as I think it is, I would agree with Gordon J.A., in the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, and declare the Act in toto ultra vires of the legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan. Of course, incidentally I also agree with that part of the judgment of Martin C.J., concurred in by Proctor J.A., insofar as they declare ultra vires that part of the Act which relates to the \"producing area.\"\nIn view of my conclusion it becomes unnecessary to pass upon the question of severability.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs throughout and dismiss the cross-appeal with costs against the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellants are the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and certain other companies who brought an action against the respondents, the Attorney General for the Province of Saskatchewan and the Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development of the Province of Saskatchewan, in the King's Bench in Saskatchewan, for a declaration that The Mineral Taxation Act of Saskatchewan, being chapter 27 of the Statutes of 1944 (2nd Session) and amendments were ultra vires the legislature of the province, and for certain other relief. At the date of the trial this Act and the amendments thereto had been repealed and replaced by The Mineral Taxation Act, being chapter 24 of the 1948 Statutes and the appellants were permitted to amend their statement of claim so that the important question raised was whether the last, mentioned Act (as amended in 1949, after the commencement of the action but before the trial) was ultra vires. In 1950, after the conclusion of the trial and before judgment, other amendments were enacted but it is not contended that the latter are not relevant since, by express provision, they were made retroactive. What we are called upon to decide, therefore, is whether the 1948 Act as thus amended in 1949 and 1950 is ultra vires. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal 43 dealt with several other matters raised by the parties who, however, have now abandoned their contentions with respect thereto. The appellants no longer claim (a) that the delegation of certain powers to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council by subsections 1 and 2 of section 5, is ultra vires; (b) that even if the 1948 Act is intra vires in all respects, it is inoperative in respect of the appellant Canadian Pacific Railway Company. On the other hand, the respondents abandoned their claim that the action was not properly brought against the Attorney General and the Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development.\nThe 1948 Mineral Taxation Act and the amendments thereto of 1949 and 1950 (hereafter referred to compendiously as the Act) provide for the imposition of taxes. Under the general scheme of the Act all the land in the Province of Saskatchewan may be divided into two categories, one of which, for convenience, may be termed the non-producing area, and the other of which will mean producing areas or a producing area. In the non-producing area a tax is imposed by section 3 on the owner of minerals within, upon, or under any land, at the rate of three cents per acre or fraction thereof.\nA producing area is established by a declaration of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the authority of subsection 1 of section 5, which also delegates to that body the power to increase, decrease or abolish any producing area. In any such declaration, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, by virtue of subsection 2 of section 5, designate the mineral or minerals in respect of which the designated area is being, or was, constituted a producing area. Provision is made for the appointment of an assessor who, by section 7, is to assess at their fair value all minerals upon or under any parcel of land situated within a producing area and within the boundaries of which land minerals are then being produced or to the knowledge of the assessor have at any time been produced. By section 6, everyone whose name appears on the assessment roll, prepared by the assessor, shall be liable for and shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year pay to the Minister a tax at such rate as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time prescribe, not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value of his minerals. By section 22, every owner of minerals within, upon or under any land situated within a producing area shall be liable for and shall, on or before December 31st, in each year in which such minerals have not been assessed, pay to the Minister a tax at the rate of fifty cents per acre or fraction thereof. What happened was that by successive orders of the Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development upon whom the powers were conferred by the 1944 Act (and also the 1948 Act before amendment), a certain area was declared a producing area; that area was increased; coal was designated as the only mineral; and, finally, the producing area was decreased. No assessment was ever made in the producing area. In the result, therefore, under section 22 a tax was imposed of fifty cents per acre on every \"owner\" of the \"mineral\" coal in the producing area, while in the non-producing area, in which is included all other owners, a tax of three cents per acre became payable under section 3. However, the terms of the Act providing for a tax at an annual rate on the dollar must be considered together with the other relevant provisions.\nThe trial judge, Thomson J., declared that all classes of taxation were valid and in the Court of Appeal 44, Culliton J.A. (with whom McNiven J.A. agreed) came to the same conclusion. The Chief Justice (with whom Proctor J.A. agreed) considered that only the taxation in the non-producing area was valid while Gordon J.A. considered the Act ultra vires in toto.\nThe main contention is that the Act does not impose direct taxation within the Province under section 92(2) of the British North America Act but in my view that argument is not sound. Dealing first with a non-producing area, section 3 imposes the three cents per acre tax upon \"every owner of minerals, whether of all kinds or only one or more kinds, within, upon or under any land\". By paragraph 6 of subsection 1 of section 2, \" 'owner' means a person who is registered in a land titles office as the owner of any mineral or minerals whether or not the title thereto is severed from the title to the surface;\" By paragraph 4 of subsection 1 of section 2:\u2014\n\"mineral\" means the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land,\nBy paragraph 2 of subsection 1 of section 2:\u2014\" 'certificate of title' means a certificate of title granted pursuant to The Land Titles Act\". The Land Titles Act is presently R.S.S. 1940, chapter 98, and under section 2(1) thereof \" 'certificate of title' means the certificate (Form A) granted by the registrar and entered and kept in the register\". By section 10 of The Land Titles Act:\u2014\n10. \"Land\" or \"lands\" means lands, messuages, tenements and hereditaments, corporeal and incorporeal, of every nature and description, and every estate or interest therein, whether such estate or interest is legal or equitable, together with paths, passages, ways, watercourses, liberties, privileges and easements, appertaining thereto, and trees and timber thereon, and mines, minerals and quarries thereon or thereunder lying or being, unless any such are specially excepted;\nThese provisions make it plain that the tax in the non-producing area is imposed upon the owner of any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land, or the owner of the right to work, win and carry away such minerals. Where a person appears from a certificate of title under The Land Titles Act as the owner of the mines or minerals or has the right to work, win and carry them away, he is liable to the tax of three cents per acre whether there be minerals in the land or not. This is a land tax and is clearly direct taxation: Halifax v. Fairbanks 45; Attorney General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co. 46. In substance this is the view of all, save one, of the members of the Courts below who have considered the matter.\nIf, in the Act, no provisions had been made in producing areas for an assessment roll and the imposition of a tax at an annual rate on the dollar, and section 22 had merely provided that every owner of minerals within a producing area should pay a tax at the rate of fifty cents per acre, the same result would follow. The mere fact that provision is made for an assessment roll, etc., does not in my opinion change the character of the tax. Section 7 provides that the assessor is to assess at their fair value all minerals within, upon or under any parcel of land situated within a producing area and within the boundaries of which land minerals are then being produced, or to the knowledge of the assessor have at any time been produced. In such assessment roll there is to be set out, among other things, a brief description of each such parcel of land and of the minerals assessed. \"Parcel of land\" is defined by paragraph 7 of subsection 1 of section 2 as meaning:\u2014\n7. \"parcel of land\" means all the separately described areas, within the boundaries of a section according to the system of surveys under The Land Surveys Act or within the boundaries of a river lot, which are contiguous and in respect of which the same person is the owner of the minerals. For the purpose of this paragraph, separately described areas which have at least part of their boundaries in common or which are separated only by a highway, road or railway right of way shall be deemed to be contiguous, and separately described areas adjoining at only one point shall be deemed to be not contiguous;\nThis is not a tax on production. In the Esquimalt case, 47, Lord Greene, speaking for the judicial committee,, adopted, at page 115, as correct what had been said by O'Halloran J.A. in that case:\u2014\nBecause land bears a tax which is measured by the reflected value of its products is no reason to say that the tax on the land is a colourable tax on its products, and that such a tax is not in truth a tax on the land itself.\nThese remarks apply with equal force to the problem now under consideration and it was for these reasons that the trial judge and McNiven J.A. and Culliton J.A. came to the same conclusion.\nFinally, there is nothing to indicate that the legislature was not in truth doing what it purported to do, that is, impose a direct tax for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. On this point I am content to adopt the reasoning of those members of the Courts below who so held.\nThe appeal of the plaintiffs should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal of the defendants should be allowed with costs. The judgment at the trial should be restored. The defendants are entitled to the costs of the appeal by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal but there should be no costs of the cross-appeals to that Court. Rand J.:\u2014This is an appeal arising out of The Mineral Taxation Act, 1948, of Saskatchewan. The province has purported to tax all minerals within its boundaries except those within, upon or under railway lands, the land within any city, town or village, or within any registered subdivision of lots for residential or business purposes or for a cemetery.\n\"Mineral\" is defined by sec. 2(4) as meaning \"the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land.\"\nThe tax scheme imposes, first, a general annual levy of three cents on every taxable acre or fractional part of an acre not within what may be declared to be a \"producing area\". The language of sec. 2, providing this initial tax, is:\u2014\nEvery owner of minerals, whether of all kinds or only one or more kinds, within, upon or under any land not situated within a producing area, shall be liable for and shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year pay to the minister a tax at the rate of three cents for every acre and every fraction of an acre of such land in respect of which he is such owner.\nThen, by sec. 5, the Governor-in-Council is authorized from time to time to declare any portion of the province to constitute a \"producing area\", and, in any manner, to modify or abolish such an area.\nSec. 7 directs an assessment each year \"at their fair value\" of all minerals \"within, upon or under any parcel of land situated within a producing area and within the boundaries of which land minerals are then being produced or to the knowledge of the assessor have at any time been produced, and shall prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out as accurately as may be a brief description of each such parcel of land, a brief description of the minerals assessed, the names and addresses of the owners of the minerals and the assessed value thereof\". Subsection (2) authorizes him to resort to all available information pertinent to that value. Section 2(7) defines \"parcel of land\" to mean:\u2014\n. . . . all the separately described areas, within the boundaries of a section according to the system of surveys under The Land Surveys Act or within the boundaries of a river lot, which are contiguous and in respect of which the same person is the owner of the minerals. For the purpose of this paragraph, separately described areas which have at least part of their boundaries in common or which are separated only by a highway, road or railway right of way shall be deemed to be contiguous, and separately described areas adjoining at only one point shall be deemed to be not contiguous;\nFinally, by section 22, it is provided that:\u2014\nSubject to subsection (2) of section 5, every owner of minerals, whether of all kinds or only one or more kinds, within, upon or under any land situated within a producing area shall be liable for and shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year in which such minerals have not been assessed under the provisions of this Act, pay to the minister a tax at the rate of fifty cents for every acre and every fraction of an acre of such land in respect of which he is such owner.\nThe appellants are the owners of minerals, both severed and unsevered in title from the fee simple, and have brought this action for a declaration that the statute is ultra vires; and the narrow question presented is whether the annual tax of mineral in situ, as a component of the soil, having a special discrete value to be realized upon some manner of removal from the soil, is direct taxation within the meaning of these words as used in head 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act.\nThe argument assumed that there is mineral of some nature and quantity in all lands, and the tax has, therefore, in fact in all cases a real subject-matter. The contention of the appellants is, moreover, that the three categories of tax must stand or fall together. Mr. Leslie, in his able and frank argument, urged that, although for the purposes of taxing land as such, the value of all its component parts, ascertained by some means or other, may be reflected, yet when a mineral component is segregated as a subject-matter of tax, that becomes equivalent to the taxation of an article in commerce, an article, in effect, on its way to market, in which the tax is gathered up as part of the charges intended and expected to be recouped in the price.\nThat, for the purposes of a land tax, the assessed value of land can reflect the value of its products, such as timber, even though the timber represents substantially the entire value, was laid down by the judicial committee in the case of British Columbia v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Railway Company 48. This Court 49 had held the proposed imposts to be a tax in substance on the timber as and when severed, but that view was rejected. I can see no difference, for this purpose, between the reflected value of a \"growing\" product and one, such as mineral, of a somewhat desparate character and of a limited quantity or existence : they are all, in contemplation of law, part of the soil.\nThe reflected value of a severable portion of land can only be determined, in a practical sense, by estimating its worth in situ in relation to its market worth as a commodity, after making allowance for all costs and risks: to which, for the total tax on the land, would be added the residual value of the soil, that is, of such part as was not involved in realizing the value of the severable portion: at least, counsel could suggest no other means or method by which, as in the Nanaimo case, the land tax could be computed, and none has occurred to me; and the market price of the land as an entirety would be based on the same factors. If, then, these can be so combined and treated as a single tax on the land, what is there in the nature of taxation or the subject-matter of taxation to prevent the two components from having their individual value ascertainments carried right into the same or different assessments so long as the tax is against each only as it is in situ? Since a mineral occupies space, its taxation includes the space it fills, and in every sense is directed against the land.\nIn Esquimalt, Lord Greene takes as a significant consideration the fact that the tax was charged upon the land only and did not attach to the severed timber. That is the effect of section 23(a) here: the tax is in respect of materials in situ, and only against them as they form part of the land does the charge apply.\nLord Greene in the same case speaks of the \"fundamental difference\" between the \"economic tendency\" of an owner to try to shift the incidence of a tax and the \"passing on\" of the tax regarded as the hallmark of an indirect tax. In relation to commodities in commerce, I take this to lie in the agreed conceptions of economists of charges which fall into the category of accumulating items: and the question is, what taxes, through intention and expectation, are to be included in those items? If the tax is related or relateable, directly or indirectly, to a unit of the commodity or its price, imposed when the commodity is in course of being manufactured or marketed, then the tax tends to cling as a burden to the unit or the transaction presented to the market. However much, in any case, these may be actually \"intended\" or \"expected\" to be passed on, it is now settled that they are to be so treated: Attorney-General for British Columbia v. C.P. Railway Company 50; R. v. Caledonian Collieries 51.\nIn the case, on the other hand, of any large public undertaking, the taxes on its fixed assets might wipe out any operating profit and its revenue have to be increased to avoid such a result; but that, obviously, would not convert them into indirect taxes.\nHere we have an intermediate case: a capital asset which, in the course of its business exploitation, becomes used up. The tax is not in any way related to the course of that exploitation. It is an annual levy on the total quantity then existing; and that capital tax could not, in the sense of a general tendency, be taken to be intended and expected to be passed on to the consumer as an element of the price: it might be paid for years before a ton of mineral was removed. There might be the \"economic tendency\" to transfer some of it to price, but that is as irrelevant here as in Esquimalt.\nThe tax, at the moment of imposition, is in fact against land; it is an annual impost; the charge securing it is limited to land; and it is not an item related to or recognized as reflected in the cluster of charges intended and expected to be recouped in the price of the marketed commodity. It is of the nature of a fixed asset tax rather than a transaction tax; and it is therefore direct. That being so in the case of the tax based on an annual assessment of value, it is much more clearly so in the cases of the flat acreage rates.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal and restore the judgment at trial. The respondents will be entitled to their costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal. Kellock J.:\u2014In my opinion, the question involved in this appeal does not lend itself to extended discussion and it is unnecessary to re-state the nature of the legislation under which it arises. The legislation is said to be ultra vires the provincial legislature on the ground that, properly understood, its effect is to impose taxation on an article of commerce and is thus indirect.\nIt is well settled that ownership of mineral in situ as an interest in land may be severed from ownership of the \"surface\" rights. There is in principle no reason, in my opinion, why, although taxation in respect of the unity of ownership is direct, and taxation of the \"surface\" rights is also direct, taxation in respect of the mineral rights should be regarded in any other light. The tax here in question is an annual levy, payable notwithstanding that the mineral never becomes a commodity. Such a tax, in my opinion, is simply a land tax.\nI would dismiss the appeal of the plaintiffs and allow the appeal of the defendants, both with costs. The defendants should have the costs of the appeal by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs of the cross-appeals to that court.\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellants, owners of the mineral rights under a large acreage in Saskatchewan, submit that by the enactment of The Mineral Taxation Act (S. of S. 1948, c. 24, as amended 1949, c. 23, and 1950, c. 22) the Province of Saskatchewan has imposed indirect taxation and, therefore, acted beyond its authority within the meaning of s. 92(2) of the British North America Act. Section 92(2) reads:\n92. In each province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\n2. Direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nUnder the foregoing section, therefore, the Province can impose only those taxes which are properly classified as direct. Since 1887 (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe 52), John Stuart Mill's definition of direct and indirect taxes has been adopted as an appropriate basis upon which, in a legal sense, particular taxes may be classified under one or other of these headings. This definition reads:\nA direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another. Such are the excise or customs.\nWhether a tax is direct or indirect within the meaning of Mill's definition is determined \"primarily by an examination of the nature and effect of the tax as collected from the language describing it.\" A.G. for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry Co. 53.\nThe statute imposing the tax is entitled The Mineral Taxation Act. In s. 2(4) the word \"mineral\" is defined and the material part thereof reads as follows:\n4. \"mineral\" means the right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land, ....\nThe certificate of title here referred to is that defined in s. 2(1) of The Land Titles Act (1940 R.S.S., c. 98) as \"the certificate (form A) granted by the registrar and entered and kept in the register.\" By s. 61 of the same act, once \"a certificate of title has been granted no instrument shall until registered pass any estate or interest in the land \u2026\" \"Land\" is then defined by s. 2(10) to include mines and minerals.\nSections 3, 6 and 22 are the charging sections of this Mineral Taxation statute. In each the tax is imposed upon the owner of minerals. \"Owner\" is defined in s. 2(6) and the relevant portion thereof reads:\n6. \"owner\" means a person who is registered in a land titles office as the owner of any mineral or minerals whether or not the title thereto is severed from the title to the surface; . . . .\nSection 3 imposes a flat rate of three cents per acre upon the owner of minerals in a non-producing area of the province. This area includes the entire province except that which from time to time may be declared by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, under s. 5, a producing area. When an area has been declared to be a producing area the statute contemplates that each owner of minerals therein shall pay the tax computed upon one or other of two methods. Under s. 7\nthe assessor shall . . . . . assess at their fair value all minerals within, upon or under any parcel of land situated within a producing area and within the boundaries of which land minerals are then being produced or to the knowledge of the assessor have at any time been produced \u2026\nThen under s. 6\nEvery owner whose name appears on the assessment roll mentioned in section 7 shall . . . . pay to the minister a tax . . . . not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value of his minerals . . . .\nHowever, any owner in a producing area whose name does not appear on the assessment roll mentioned in s. 7 and, therefore, not subject to the tax under s. 6, comes within the provisions of s. 22, under which he shall pay\nto the minister a tax at the rate of fifty cents for every acre and every fraction of an acre of such land in respect of which he is such owner.\nSection 23(a) provides that the tax imposed shall be a special lien upon the mineral or minerals in respect of which it is payable. This feature was regarded as of great significance by the judicial committee in A.G. for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry. Co. supra at p. 115.\nUnder s. 27, if the owner leases any mineral or minerals to another person, or grants the right to work the minerals in his land, he shall remain liable for this tax and any agreement to the contrary \"shall be null, void and of no effect.\" It is then provided that any such lessee or other person in the section mentioned may pay the tax and realize the same as a debt owing to him from the owner.\nThis statute imposes a tax upon every person \"registered in a land titles office as the owner of any mineral.\" As \"land\" is defined in The Land Titles Act (R.S.S. 1940, c. 98, s. 2(10)) to include mines and minerals, it follows that the language of the statute imposes a tax upon an interest in land. The intention of the legislature to levy a tax upon an interest in land is found not only in the language adopted in this act, but by the fact that at the same session it amended the City, Town, Village and Rural Municipality Acts (respectively chapters 126, 127, 128 and 129, R.S.S. 1940), by which the municipal bodies could no longer impose a tax upon that interest in land subject to taxation under The Mineral Taxation Act. As minerals are, in effect, presumed to exist within, upon, or under the areas described in the certificates of title throughout the province, there is here created a provincial tax upon an interest in land, while the municipal bodies continue to impose taxes upon the remaining interest therein.\nThe appellants contend that granting the ownership of minerals in situ constitutes an interest in land and, in that sense, a tax imposed upon that interest is a land tax, it does not necessarily follow that the tax here in question is a direct tax. The mere designation of a tax as a tax on land, or an interest therein, does not, of course, make it a land tax, but if, in substance, it is a tax upon land or an interest therein then it has consistently been classified as a direct tax. The appellants, in support of their contention, submit that the mineral, as an interest in land, has no value until such time as it may be removed from the land and become a commodity of commerce. It is true that a mineral has no value in use until it is extracted, but a contention that it has no value while a constituent part of the land cannot be accepted as accurate. It is rather more in accord with fact to suggest that with respect to such a mineral in situ it is in itself a matter of value which increases as the certainty of the quantity and the quality of the mineral becomes known. This value, so long as the flat rates of three and fifty cents per acre are imposed (and these alone have so far been imposed), would not enter into the computation of this tax. It would, of course, where the computation is upon the assessment basis, as provided under ss. 6 and 7. Even if we assume that this assessment value reflects the productive value of the land, that would not preclude its remaining a taxation upon land. A.G. for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry. Co. supra.\nThe tax here in question is a tax upon an interest in land and, both within and without the producing area, is imposed irrespective of whether the mineral is being removed or not. The tax within the producing area is higher and in that area may be computed upon an assessment basis or a flat rate of fifty cents per acre, but no distinction is made in either case between the owner removing the mineral and the owner allowing it to remain in situ. Four of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal 54 were of the opinion that the tax, as here imposed in a non-producing area, of three cents per acre was direct, Chief Justice Martin stating:\nThe tax of three cents per acre imposed in Section 3 of the Act is in respect of the taxpayer's particular interest in the property and it is intended and desired that he should pay it though it may be possible for him to pass the burden to someone else.\nThe majority of the learned judges were of the opinion that the tax as imposed in a producing area, whether computed on either the assessed value or as a flat rate of fifty cents per acre, was, however, indirect. Neither the increase from three to fifty cents, nor the change to a computation of the tax upon an assessment basis, with the greatest possible respect, alters or affects the true nature and character of the tax, which remains the same in both the producing and non-producing areas, which, as already stated, include the entire province. The majority of the learned judges appear to have been influenced by the decision of The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Limited 55. There the province of Alberta imposed a percentage tax upon the gross revenues from coal mines and this gross revenue was interpreted to mean \"the aggregate of sums received from sales of coal,\" and to be \"indistinguishable from a tax upon every sum received from the sale of coal.\" The parties contesting the validity of the tax in that case were producers of coal and the tax was, therefore, upon coal as a commodity in commerce rather than as it rested undisturbed in the soil. In the case at bar the tax is in relation to the mineral or minerals which constitute an interest in land and is imposed upon the owners without regard to whether that interest, or any part of it, will ever be removed from the land. It would, therefore, appear, with great respect, that the Collieries case is quite distinguishable.\nCounsel for the appellants argues that the taxpayer of this tax will seek to pass it on. That may well be true. It is usually true that the taxpayer seeks to do so, but that is not the test. The true test is whether, by virtue of its nature and character, the tax is of a type such that, having regard to its normal tendencies, it will be passed on. As stated by Lord Hobhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe supra at p. 582:\nThe legislature cannot possibly have meant to give a power of taxation valid or invalid according to its actual results in particular cases. It must have contemplated some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies.\nIn The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Limited supra it was contended that the tax there imposed upon the gross revenue received by the mine owner was not indirect, inter alia because it could not be passed on. Their Lordships stated:\nUnder particular circumstances the recovery of the tax may, it is true, be economically undesirable or practically impossible, but the general tendency of the tax remains.\nAn analysis of The Mineral Taxation Act indicates that the legislature here imposes a tax upon an owner of an interest in land rather than in relation to any commodity or commercial transaction. Taxes in respect of the latter have been held ultra vires the provinces. Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada 56; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Ry Co. 57; The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Limited supra; Attorney-General of British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co. Ltd 58. Taxes in relation to the former have been held to be direct and, therefore, within the competence of the province to impose. City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate 59. In the latter case Lord Cave, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council stated at p. 126:\nIt is the nature and general tendency of the tax and not its incidence in particular or special cases which must determine its classification and validity; and, judged by that test, the business tax imposed on an owner under s. 394 is a direct tax.\nNewcombe J., writing the judgment of the majority of the Court, stated in Rattenbury v. Land Settlement Board 60 :\nTherefore, within the authority of the Fairbanks case, 1928 A.C. 117, as I interpret it, taxation upon land and upon the owner of the land is within the category of direct taxation, . . . . Both parties cited A.G, for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry. Co. supra. In that case their Lordships of the Privy Council stressed the fact, as already intimated, that the nature and character of the tax should be determined from the language of the statute creating it.\nThere was a distinction, in their Lordships' opinion, between the tax there in question and an ordinary land tax, in that it was an impost to be discharged once and for all. Here, however, that distinction is not present and the tax is in its nature identical with the ordinary land tax. As stated by Mr. Justice Thomson:\nIt is a re-occurring tax against the \"owner of minerals\" levied annually against the same person as long as he continues the owner and without regard to whether any attempt is ever made to lease or work the minerals or not.\nThe references of their Lordships to a timber tax must be read in relation to the contention there made that, though the language creating the tax described it as a land tax, in effect it was a tax upon timber as and when cut. Their Lordships did not accept this contention and in the course of their reasons stated at p. 117:\nIt is natural that the legislature in imposing a tax of this nature should give the assessee the opportunity to defer payment until such time as he could provide himself with the necessary money by reaping the produce of his land.\nand at p. 118:\n. . . . the tax is in reality a tax on land and not a timber tax. The existing land tax imposed by provincial legislation is imposed on both timber-bearing lands and non-timber-bearing lands.\nOnce it is determined that the true nature and character of the tax is in relation to land, that case holds that the mere fact it is computed upon the productive capacity of the land does not alter or change its nature and character.\nThe appeal on the part of the appellants should be dismissed with costs, the respondents' cross-appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment at trial restored. In the Court of Appeal the respondents should have their costs upon the appeal but no costs as to their cross-appeals.\nLocke J.:\u2014The appellant companies are the owners of the mineral rights in something more than three and a half million acres of land in the province of Saskatchewan. With unimportant exceptions, these lands are part of those conveyed to the various companies by the Grown as grants in connection with the construction of the lines of railway forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway system. To what extent the title to these properties originally vested in the companies by letters patent from the Crown have been brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act (cap. 98, R.S.S. 1940) is not disclosed by the evidence. As shown by one of the exhibits filed, the letters patent vested in the grantee an estate in fee simple reserving only to the Crown the free use, passage and enjoyment of all navigable waters flowing through the land. As to such parts of the land as were brought under the operation of the Land Titles Act, a certificate of title filed shows that when the surface rights were sold a new certificate of title was issued to the purchaser, the title of the railway company to the minerals being then evidenced either by the certificate of title bearing an endorsement showing it to be cancelled as to the surface rights or by the issue of a new certificate of title for the mineral rights. Not all of the mineral rights remained in the companies in all of the lands but the rights retained in all are such that would be affected by the taxation imposed by the Mineral Taxation Act 1948.\nSection 3 of that Act imposes a tax of three cents an acre and every fraction of an acre upon the:\u2014\nowner of minerals, whether of all kinds or only one or more kinds, within, upon or under any land, not situated within a producing area.\nBy section 22 a tax of fifty cents for every acre and fraction thereof is imposed upon every such owner of minerals situated within a producing area, in each year in which such minerals have not been assessed under the provisions of section 7 of the Act. Where the Minister has declared that any portion of the province shall constitute a producing area, the mineral or minerals to be assessed in such area may be designated by him, and after their value has been assessed under the provisions of section 7 every owner whose name appears on the assessment roll shall be liable to a tax at such rate as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may prescribe, not exceeding ten mills on the dollar of the assessed value. \"Owner\" is defined by subsection 6 of section 2 as a person who is registered in a land titles office as the owner of any mineral or minerals whether or not the title thereto is severed from the title to the surface. Subsection 4 of section 2 defines \"mineral\" as meaning:\u2014\nthe right existing in any person by virtue of a certificate of title to work, win and carry away any mineral or minerals within, upon or under the area described in the certificate of title, and also any mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land.\nI respectfully agree with the learned trial judge that whatever may be the meaning of the first part of this so-called interpretation section, it cannot restrict the effect of the latter part, and that the words \"mineral or minerals within, upon or under any land,\" must be construed in their natural and ordinary sense. In view of the fact that the appellants are the owners of some or all of such minerals as may be contained in all of the lands in question, nothing is to be gained by considering the question as to whether a tax upon the right to work, win and carry away such minerals can be supported as direct taxation.\nThe right of the owner of minerals found on or under the surface of land, whether held in conjunction with the ownership of the surface rights or separately from such rights, is an interest or estate in land. It is in respect of the ownership of such interest that this taxation is imposed. A tax so imposed is not to be distinguished, in my opinion, from a tax upon the interest of the owner of the surface of the land in the sense of being direct unless, under the guise of taxing that interest, the legislature is really attempting to impose a tax upon the minerals as commodities after they have been mined. The question is not, in my opinion, concluded by the language of the taxing section and the fact that the tax is imposed in respect of an interest in land, since, as was said by Viscount Haldane in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada 61, the question of the nature of a tax is one of substance and does not turn only upon the language used by the local legislature which imposes it, but on the provisions of the Imperial Statute of 1867. This is on the face of it a tax upon land and thus a tax of a kind which was at the time of the passing of the British North America Act everywhere treated as a direct tax. The tax is imposed annually and whether or not such minerals as exist may ever be mined or removed. In like manner the taxes imposed by municipalities upon owners of surface rights are payable, whether or not the land be put to any use. While it may well be true that as and when the minerals or the right to mine them are sold by the present owners, the tendency will be to endeavour to obtain recoupment of the amounts paid as mineral tax to the province by increasing the price demanded this fact does not of itself establish that the legislation contemplated that the tax be thus borne in whole or in part by others or be in any sense imposed upon the minerals or commodities as and when they were removed.\nTaxes of a like nature have been imposed by several of the provinces of Canada and in one for a long period of years. By the Placer Mining Act of British Columbia (sec. 152, cap. 136, R.S.B.C. 1897) there was imposed upon the owner of every mineral or placer claim of which a Crown grant had been issued an annual tax of twenty-five cents on every acre and fractional part of an acre conveyed by the grant. Taxation of this nature has been continuously imposed in that province since that time and is now imposed upon every owner of a mineral claim, with certain defined exceptions by the Taxation Act (sec. 55 and 56, cap. 332, R.S.B.C. 1948). An acreage tax was imposed upon the owners of all mining rights in Ontario by the Mining Tax Act (cap. 26, R.S.O. 1914, sec. 15). In Manitoba, by the Mining Tax Act, the owner, holder, lessee or occupier of every mineral claim is liable to an annual tax of $5.00 (sec. 3 cap. 207, R.S.M. 1940). In Alberta, by the Mineral Taxation Act 1947, taxation of a similar nature to that imposed by the Saskatchewan Statute here in question is imposed. The fact that the legislation in British Columbia, Ontario and Manitoba has not, so far as I am aware, been attacked on the ground that it is ultra vires as being indirect taxation, does not, of course, establish its validity. It is not without significance, however, that a tax of this nature is apparently regarded by those engaged in the mining industry as a proper exercise of provincial powers to tax land and interests in land and as a direct tax. I think the decision of the judicial committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company 62, does not assist in determining the present matter. The proposed taxes referred to in Questions 5 and 6 which are mentioned at pages 93 and 94 of the report were to be imposed upon the land but in the case of Question 5 to be payable only as and when the merchantable timber was cut and severed from the land, and in the case of Question 6 at the election of the taxpayer only as the timber was cut. The time at which these taxes were to become payable and the fact that if the timber was not cut they would never become payable lent support to the view that, while expressed as a land tax, the real intention was to impose taxation upon the commodity after it had been severed from the land. Had it been proposed that the taxes be levied annually and upon the owner in respect of its ownership of the timber and the right to cut and remove it as an incidence of that ownership and thus a tax upon an interest in land (Glenwood Lumber Company v. Phillips 63), the decision in the matter would have directly touched the question with which we are concerned.\nWith great respect for the contrary opinion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, it is my view that each of the three taxes in question is a direct tax and not imposed with the intention that it should be passed on to someone else and that the province is not by this legislation attempting indirectly to impose a tax on the minerals as and when they are mined and sold. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs and allow the cross-appeal with costs. There should be no costs of the cross-appeal in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed; both with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E. H. M.

Dufour, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 264\nDate: 1952-06-30\nArs\u00e8ne Bilodeau (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLionel Dufour and Jean-Marie Dufour (Defendants) Respondents.\n1952: April 2, 3; 1952: June 30.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Cart-wright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nRoad, use of\u2014Civil fruits\u2014Possession by sufferance of the Crown\u2014Droit de superficie\u2014Arts. 400, 1608, 2196 C.C.\nIn the years preceding 1948, the appellant built a road on Crown and colonization lands in the County of Charlevoix, P.Q. In 1948, following a tariff established by contract, the respondents paid the appellant a certain sum for the use of the road. But in 1949, after the expiration of the contract, the respondents refused to pay for their further use thereof. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court and by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action maintained.\nAlthough the appellant was not the owner of the bed on which he built his road, he nevertheless acquired by sufferance of the State, the real owner thereof, a possession available against third parties and which gave him the right to the civil fruits.\nFurthermore, he acquired, to the knowledge of the State, a \"droit de superficie\" giving him the undisputable ownership of the surface of the road against third parties.\nHeld further, that s. 103 of R.S.Q. 1941, c. 93, has no application since the road works were not executed through the appellant's own timber limits.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Galipeault C.J.A. dissenting, the dismissal of the action by the trial judge.\nGustave Mouette, Q.C., and Edgar Gosselin, Q.C., for the appellant. Since the contract did not mention when the payments for the use of the road would cease to be due, it follows that that part of the contract was still in force in 1949.\nSubsidiarily, the appellant's title to the road resting as it did on his possession thereof, there was in favour of the appellant a presumption of ownership as a result of which the provisions of Art. 1608 C.C. can be invoked in order to claim the civil fruits. Subsidiarily, the appellant bases his claim on the maxim \"nul ne peut s'enrichir aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui\".\nFurthermore, the appellant acquired a \"droit de superficie\" on the road which gave him the right to the civil fruits. Tremblay v. Guay 2.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorion, Q.C., for the respondents. The contract was definitely expired. There can be no question of a tacit renewal. Even if Art. 1608 C.C. applied, there is no evidence of the annual value of the occupation and furthermore, that Article applies only between the owner and the occupant and not between the possessor and the occupant.\nThere cannot be any question of the \"droit de superficie\". There is no distinction between the works and the ground. Even if we could assume a \"droit de superficie\", the recourse was to prevent the use, or to prove damages or the enrichment without cause. And it is not sufficient to say that the non-payment was an impoverishment, he had to prove the fact of it and the amount. Tanguay v. Price 3.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.\u2014Le demandeur, marchand de bois de St-Sim\u00e9on, Comt\u00e9 de Charlevoix, r\u00e9clame du d\u00e9fendeur la somme de $1,642.13. Il all\u00e8gue dans sa d\u00e9claration que, pour se rendre \u00e0 ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s au Lac Port aux Quilles, qui sont situ\u00e9es \u00e0 environ cinq milles au nord de la route nationale, il a construit et a entretenu un chemin priv\u00e9 pour en permettre l'acc\u00e8s. En 1945, ce chemin a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 sur une distance de sept milles, dans la direction du nord, depuis le Lac Port aux Quilles jusqu'aux limites foresti\u00e8res de la Compagnie Price Brothers, pour qui le demandeur faisait la coupe du bois.\nPour l'am\u00e9lioration et la construction de ces deux parties de route qui s'\u00e9tendent sur une distance de douze milles, le demandeur a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $40,000, et il a utilis\u00e9 ce chemin pour le transport du bois et pour conduire les p\u00eacheurs aux divers lacs dont il est le propri\u00e9taire dans la r\u00e9gion.\nAu mois d'octobre 1947, les d\u00e9fendeurs qui d\u00e9siraient transporter du bois dans la m\u00eame localit\u00e9, sign\u00e8rent un contrat avec le demandeur, et furent autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 se servir de la route en payant $2.00 par mille pieds de bois trans- port\u00e9, et $1.00 le mille pieds pour celui qui serait achet\u00e9 par le demandeur. Les montants dus furent int\u00e9gralement pay\u00e9s au printemps de 1948.\nCependant, durant le cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1949, quand le contrat ci-dessus fut expir\u00e9, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se servir de la route pour transporter du bois de sciage et de pulpe, et ont refus\u00e9 de payer au demandeur la valeur de l'usage de la route, ce qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action au montant de $1,642.13. C'est la pr\u00e9tention des d\u00e9fendeurs-intim\u00e9s que le demandeur ne peut r\u00e9ussir, parce qu'il n'est pas propri\u00e9taire des terrains travers\u00e9s par le chemin en question, que l'article 417 du Code Civil ne peut trouver son application, et que la doctrine de l'enrichissement sans cause, vu l'absence de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels, ne peut d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nEn premi\u00e8re instance, l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour le motif qu'il appartient seul au Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil, de fixer les taux de p\u00e9age que devront payer les tiers \u00e0 une personne qui ex\u00e9cute des travaux de voirie sur ses concessions foresti\u00e8res dans le domaine de la Couronne (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 93, art. 103); mais il y a l\u00e0 \u00e9videmment une erreur, car cette disposition de la loi ne s'applique que lorsqu'une personne ex\u00e9cute des ouvrages de voirie \u00e0 travers ses propres concessions foresti\u00e8res; et dans le cas qui nous occupe, s'il est vrai que le chemin est en grande partie construit sur les terres de la Couronne, ce n'est pas \u00e0 travers les concessions foresti\u00e8res du demandeur qui n'en a pas obtenues \u00e0 cet endroit. La Cour d'Appel 4 n'a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ce motif, et devant cette Cour, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas l'invoquer.\nEn Cour d'Appel, M. le Juge St-Jacques conclut que les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel du demandeur, et que la doctrine de l'enrichissement sans cause ne peut s'appliquer vu qu'il n'y a pas eu d'appauvrissement de sa part. MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Hyde concourent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans ces vues, tandis que M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9 croit plut\u00f4t que ce chemin a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la Compagnie Price Brothers, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, le demandeur ne s'est pas appauvri par l'usage que les d\u00e9fendeurs en ont fait. M. le Juge en Chef Galipeault, qui a enregistr\u00e9 sa dissidence, et qui aurait maintenu la r\u00e9clamation jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $1,220.13, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que l'action de in rem verso \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Les Parties sont maintenant devant cette Cour apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler.\nIl importe en premier lieu de signaler qu'il ne fait pas de doute que le demandeur n'est pas propri\u00e9taire de l'assiette du chemin. Ce chemin, en effet, est b\u00e2ti sur les terres de la Couronne pour la plupart non conc\u00e9d\u00e9es, et traverse quelques lots de colons. Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es il existait, \u00e0 partir de la route nationale jusqu'au Lac de Port aux Quilles, un petit sentier ou \"portage\" par o\u00f9 passaient les colons de m\u00eame que les chasseurs et les p\u00eacheurs. Sur cette distance de cinq milles, le demandeur a \u00e9largi cette route de 12 \u00e0 24 pieds, y a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 du gravier et l'a ainsi rendue carrossable, permettant aux camions de transporter d'assez lourdes charges de bois. Sur une distance d'environ deux milles et demi, le demandeur a suivi le trac\u00e9 de l'ancien sentier, et sur une distance \u00e9gale, il a ouvert le chemin dans la for\u00eat. Plus au nord, depuis le Lac Port aux Quilles jusqu'aux limites de la Compagnie Price Brothers, le chemin est enti\u00e8rement neuf, et passe \u00e0 travers la for\u00eat qu'il a fallu d\u00e9fricher sur une longueur de sept milles. Le demandeur nous dit que quand il a fallu passer la route sur des lots conc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 des colons par le gouvernement provincial, il a obtenu le consentement de ces derniers.\nMais est-il n\u00e9cessaire que le demandeur soit propri\u00e9taire de l'assiette du chemin pour r\u00e9ussir dans la pr\u00e9sente action, et se faire payer une compensation par les d\u00e9fendeurs pour l'usage qu'ils en ont fait? La possession qu'il avait de cette lisi\u00e8re de terrain sur une distance de douze milles, d'une largeur de douze \u00e0 vingt-quatre pieds, qu'il a am\u00e9lior\u00e9e au prix d'environ $40,000, est-elle suffisante pour lui conf\u00e9rer un droit de r\u00e9clamer un loyer juste et raisonnable?\nIl ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 que le demandeur occupait ces terres par tol\u00e9rance de la Couronne, et dans certains cas avec le consentement des colons qui avaient \u00e9videmment int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que cette route f\u00fbt construite.\nIl est de r\u00e8gle que pour avoir une possession utile, cette possession ne peut \u00eatre affect\u00e9e de pr\u00e9carit\u00e9. C'est-\u00e0-dire que pour poss\u00e9der utilement, deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels doivent se rencontrer, l'un mat\u00e9riel appel\u00e9 le corpus, et l'autre intentionnel appel\u00e9 l'animus. On sait que le corpus c'est le fait d'avoir mat\u00e9riellement le bien en son pouvoir, et d'\u00eatre \u00e0 m\u00eame d'accomplir sur lui des actes mat\u00e9riels de d\u00e9tention, d'usage ou de transformation. Ce corpus n'est pas constitu\u00e9 par des actes juridiques tels que le bail et la vente. L'animus au contraire est l'intention, la volont\u00e9 chez le possesseur de soumettre une chose \u00e0 l'exercice du droit auquel normalement correspondent les actes mat\u00e9riels d'usage et de transformation. (Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 3, verbo Possession, section 1.) Cette possession, o\u00f9 se rencontrent ainsi le corpus et l'animus, se distingue donc clairement d'avec la d\u00e9tention ou la simple possession pr\u00e9caire, qui consiste \u00e0 avoir un pouvoir de faits sur une chose pour le compte du propri\u00e9taire, soit avec la permission de celui-ci, soit en vertu d'une habilitation de la loi ou de la justice. Si le d\u00e9tenteur ou possesseur pr\u00e9caire a le corpus, il n'a s\u00fbrement pas la volont\u00e9 de se comporter comme propri\u00e9taire. Ainsi, on a toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme d\u00e9tenteurs pr\u00e9caires le fermier, le locataire, le titulaire d'un bail \u00e0 complant, le cr\u00e9ancier antichr\u00e9siste. C'est que ces d\u00e9tenteurs d\u00e9tiennent pour une autre personne, et leur possession implique n\u00e9cessairement la reconnaissance du droit d'autrui. Ils ont contract\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis le propri\u00e9taire une obligation de restitution \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance plus ou moins \u00e9loign\u00e9e. Ces personnes ont bien quelque objet en mains, mais en vertu d'un droit autre qu'un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il en r\u00e9sultera par exemple que la loi leur refuse les actions possessoires. (Planiol & Ripert, Droit Civil, Les Biens, Vol. 3, page 203) (Ripert, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, Vol. 1, page 952).\nIl y aurait \u00e9galement de nombreuses consid\u00e9rations \u00e0 examiner afin de d\u00e9terminer si la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 de la possession est entach\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 absolue, ou si elle n'est que relative; c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle ne serait inutile que vis-\u00e0-vis le propri\u00e9taire, mais le possesseur pourrait tirer profit de sa possession vis-\u00e0-vis les tiers. En ce dernier cas, le possesseur aurait droit aux fruits civils de l'objet d\u00e9tenu.\nMais il ne semble pas n\u00e9cessaire de solutionner cette question, car que la possession de l'appelant soit pr\u00e9caire ou non, je crois que son appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence en France ont apport\u00e9 des adoucissements \u00e0 la rigidit\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par certains auteurs qui veulent que la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 de la possession soit absolue vis-\u00e0-vis de tous. Elles consid\u00e8rent qu'il existe des d\u00e9tenteurs dont la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'a qu'un caract\u00e8re relatif, comme la possession de ceux qui exercent un droit sur un bien du domaine public en vertu d'une concession r\u00e9vocable, et dont la possession n'est que le r\u00e9sultat d'actes de pure facult\u00e9 ou de simple tol\u00e9rance aux termes de l'article 2232 du Code Napol\u00e9on qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 2196 de notre Code Civil. Cette pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'existe que vis-\u00e0-vis de l'autorit\u00e9 conc\u00e9dante ou du propri\u00e9taire qui laisse s'accomplir des actes de simple tol\u00e9rance, mais ces possesseurs ont \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes autres personnes une possession v\u00e9ritable sur le fondement de laquelle ils peuvent, par exemple, intenter l'action en complainte. Ainsi, la Cour de Cassation a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 (Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1889, page 67) que la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 dont la possession d'un particulier est entach\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis de l'\u00c9tat, ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 ce que ce particulier puisse poss\u00e9der animo domini \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes autres personnes. La m\u00eame Cour en est \u00e9galement venue \u00e0 la conclusion (Sirey, Recueil des lois et arr\u00eats, 1855, page 507) que,\nCelui qui poss\u00e8de \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9caire une chose non prescriptible, comme faisant partie du domaine public, et qui par cons\u00e9quent ne peut avoir une action possessoire contre l'\u00c9tat qui troublerait cette possession, n'en a pas moins une action possessoire contre les tiers par lesquels il est troubl\u00e9 dans la possession que l'\u00c9tat tol\u00e8re ou ne conteste pas.\nPlaniol & Ripert (Droit Civil, Les Biens, Vol. 3, page 203) s'expriment ainsi:\nMais \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9tenteurs dont la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 est absolue, il en est d'autres dont la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'a, aux yeux de la jurisprudence, qu'un caract\u00e8re relatif. Elle consid\u00e8re comme tels: ceux qui exercent un droit sur un bien du domaine public en vertu d'une concession r\u00e9vocable, et ceux dont la possession n'est que le r\u00e9sultat d'actes de pure facult\u00e9 ou de simple tol\u00e9rance aux termes de l'article 2232 C.C. Elle d\u00e9cide que leur pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'existant qu'au regard de l'autorit\u00e9 conc\u00e9dante ou du propri\u00e9taire qui laisse s'accomplir les actes de simple tol\u00e9rance, ils ont vis-\u00e0-vis de toutes autres personnes une possession v\u00e9ritable sur le fondement de laquelle ils peuvent intenter la complainte.\nFuzier-Herman (Code Civil Annot\u00e9, 1949, Vol. 7, Art. 2232, para. 7) enseigne que,\nLa pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9tenteurs n'existant qu'au regard du propri\u00e9taire qui laisse s'accomplir les actes de simple tol\u00e9rance, ils ont, vis-\u00e0-vis de toutes autres personnes, une possession v\u00e9ritable sur le fondement de laquelle ils peuvent exercer l'action en complainte.\nCette jurisprudence a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie en France. (Planiol & Ripert, Les Biens, Vol. 3, page 204) (Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1889, page 67). La raison de cette distinction me para\u00eet \u00e9vidente. On consid\u00e8re comme d\u00e9tenteurs pr\u00e9caires le fermier, le locataire, le cr\u00e9ancier antichr\u00e9siste, etc., parce que ces personnes d\u00e9tiennent toujours pour une autre personne et doivent en vertu de leur titre n\u00e9cessairement reconna\u00eetre le droit d'autrui. Ils ne poss\u00e8dent pas animo domini. Ils ont bien le corpus mais ils n'ont pas l'animus. Leur titre m\u00eame qui limite leurs droits les en emp\u00eache. Dans le cas o\u00f9 l'autorit\u00e9 conc\u00e9dante ou le propri\u00e9taire permet par tol\u00e9rance la d\u00e9tention de son bien, il est clair que vis-\u00e0-vis de lui le possesseur n'a qu'un titre pr\u00e9caire, mais comme dans le cas que nous venons de voir, il ne poss\u00e8de pas pour autrui. Il poss\u00e8de v\u00e9ritablement pour lui-m\u00eame, c'est-\u00e0-dire animo domini. Il a v\u00e9ritablement l'intention d'agir en ma\u00eetre, comme si la chose lui appartenait, tanquam rem suam, cum animo sibi habendi. Sa d\u00e9tention est accompagn\u00e9e de la pens\u00e9e ou de l'intention d'\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire. C'est s\u00fbrement dans ce dessein qu'il a occup\u00e9 ce terrain. (Beaudant, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, 2e \u00e9d. Des Biens, Vol. 4, page 724.) Admettre la th\u00e9orie contraire, ce serait conclure que le possesseur \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9caire, qui poss\u00e8de pour son propre compte et non pour autrui, ne saurait exercer l'action en complainte contre l'auteur d'un trouble. \u00c9videmment, le possesseur ne peut pas exercer d'action en complainte contre l'\u00c9tat ni le propri\u00e9taire qui le tol\u00e8re, mais sa pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'est pas absolue et il peut, s'il est troubl\u00e9 dans sa possession, exercer contre les tiers les recours que la loi lui conf\u00e8re. (Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1889, page 67.)\nProudhon (Trait\u00e9 du domaine public, 2e \u00e9d. Vol. 3, page 325) apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 la loi fran\u00e7aise relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 de la possession du lit de certaines rivi\u00e8res par les propri\u00e9taires riverains, explique que cette pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n'existe que vis-\u00e0-vis l'\u00c9tat, mais non vis-\u00e0-vis les autres propri\u00e9taires. Il dit ce qui suit:\n981. Mais, en consid\u00e9rant lea propri\u00e9taires riverains comparativement les uns aux autres, et dans la discussion de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers relatifs au droit d'irrigation que la loi leur accorde \u00e9galement, il n'y a plus aucune cause de pr\u00e9caire \u00e0 opposer \u00e0 l'un par l'autre; et ici revient l'application de la r\u00e8gle qui veut que le possesseur, m\u00eame pr\u00e9caire, jouisse des actions du ma\u00eetre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes personnes autres que celle dont il tient sa possession. La raison en est que personne ne doit \u00eatre admis \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir des droits d'un tiers. Le m\u00eame auteur soumet d'int\u00e9ressantes consid\u00e9rations sur la distinction qui doit \u00eatre faite entre le domaine public et le domaine de l'\u00c9tat. Le domaine public ou d'administration ne comprendrait que les choses qui sont par les lois, asservies \u00e0 l'usage de tous, et dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est \u00e0 personne. Il embrasserait tous les fonds qui, sans appartenir propri\u00e9tairement \u00e0 personne, sont civilement consacr\u00e9s au service de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ces fonds sont asservis \u00e0 l'usage du public, et c'est \u00e0 la puissance publique qu'il incombe de prot\u00e9ger la jouissance que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re a le droit d'exercer sur eux. Ce n'est qu'un pouvoir d'administration dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame individuellement pris, que l'\u00c9tat exerce sur le domaine public.\nAu contraire, le domaine d'\u00c9tat ne s'appliquerait qu'aux choses qui sont commun\u00e9ment productives d'un revenu, comme sont les for\u00eats nationales, et autres biens dont le gouvernement per\u00e7oit les produits dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Couronne et du Tr\u00e9sor, et dont il jouit propri\u00e9tairement comme un simple particulier jouit de ce qui lui appartient \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres. Le domaine de l'\u00c9tat serait donc un v\u00e9ritable domaine de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant au corps politique, et dont ce corps seul doit recueillir tous les \u00e9moluments, sans que les fonds qui le composent soient soumis \u00e0 l'usage de tous les particuliers, comme quand il s'agit de fonds appartenant au domaine public. (Proudhon, Trait\u00e9 du domaine public, 2e \u00e9d. Vol. 1, pages 63, 238 et 244).\nCette distinction est \u00e9videmment inspir\u00e9e par les dispositions de l'article 538 du Code Napol\u00e9on, auquel correspond presque textuellement l'article 400 de notre Code Civil. Cet article se lit ainsi:\nArt. 400. Les chemins et routes \u00e0 la charge de l'\u00c9tat, les fleuves et rivi\u00e8res navigables et flottables et leurs rives, les rivages, lais et relais de la mer, les ports, les havres et les rades et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toutes les portions de territoires qui ne tombent pas dans le domaine priv\u00e9, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des d\u00e9pendances du domaine public.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de tous lacs et des rivi\u00e8res et cours d'eau non navigables et flottables et de leurs rives bordant les terrains ali\u00e9n\u00e9s par l'\u00c9tat apr\u00e8s le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1918.\nOn voit \u00e0 la lecture de cet article que dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des choses qui font partie du domaine public, le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 les for\u00eats non conc\u00e9d\u00e9es, et il semblerait que c'est parce qu'elles sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre d\u00e9tenues propri\u00e9tairement par l'\u00c9tat, contrairement aux routes qui sont civilement affect\u00e9es au service public. S'il en est ainsi, comme je le crois, l'appelant pouvait sans doute par tol\u00e9rance gouvernementale, obtenir \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres, une possession utile de l'assiette sur laquelle il a construit sa route, et \u00e0 laquelle l'\u00c9tat, propri\u00e9taire indiscutable, pouvait seul mettre un terme. Mignault (Vol. 2, page 456) et Langelier (Vol. 2, page 128) font cette m\u00eame distinction entre le domaine public, et le domaine de l'\u00c9tat. Vide aussi Dalloz (Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 2, verbis Domaine de l'\u00c9tat et Domaine Public).\nEn outre, dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'appelant, qui avait la possession de l'assiette du chemin, y a fait des am\u00e9liorations substantielles pour un montant d'environ $40,000. Entre lui et le gouvernement provincial qui a tol\u00e9r\u00e9 la possession de cette assiette de la route et n\u00e9cessairement les constructions qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, il est intervenu un contrat sui generis en vertu duquel le propri\u00e9taire du sol a autoris\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 jouir des constructions. Il y a dans ce cas, comme dit Baudry-Lacantinerie (Biens, N\u00b0 372) cr\u00e9ation au profit du constructeur (une sorte de droit de superficie). Fuzier-Herman (R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Superficie, N\u00b0 1) nous dit que le droit de superficie:\nconsiste \u00e0 avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9difices ou plantations sur un terrain qui appartient \u00e0 autrui.\nC'est d'ailleurs ce principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Tremblay v. Guay 5. Il est en plus certain que le superficiaire, comme d'ailleurs l'usufruitier, l'emphyt\u00e9ote, qui exercent en leur nom un droit r\u00e9el, ont le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'action possessoire. (Planiol & Ripert, Les Biens, Vol. 3, page 203.)\nJe conclus donc que si la possession de l'appelant de l'assiette du chemin est entach\u00e9e de pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis l'autorit\u00e9 conc\u00e9dante, elle ne l'est pas vis-\u00e0-vis les tiers. La position de l'appelant est renforcie par le fait qu'\u00e0 la connaissance de l'\u00c9tat, il a acquis un droit de superficie qui lui donne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la surface de la route qu'il a construite et que les tiers ne peuvent contester. On ne peut douter qu'il ne serait propri\u00e9taire d'une maison qu'il aurait \u00e9rig\u00e9e sur un sol appartenant \u00e0 la Couronne. On ne peut davantage lui nier son droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la route qu'il a construite, avec la tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire sur le sol d'autrui. Il restera \u00e0 l'appelant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer avec les propri\u00e9taires de l'assiette du chemin leurs droits et obligations respectifs, soit en vertu des articles 412 et 417, du Code Civil, ou en vertu d'autres textes qu'il est inutile d'examiner pour le moment. Ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 entre l'appelant et la Couronne ne peut int\u00e9resser les intim\u00e9s, car il s'agit de res inter alios acta. L'appelant a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa possession et de son droit de superficie, dont les fruits civils, qui dans le cas actuel sont les loyers qu'il r\u00e9clame. (C.C. 449.)\nLa valeur de l'usage de cette route pour le transport du bois fait par les d\u00e9fendeurs, est \u00e9valu\u00e9e par l'appelant \u00e0 $1,642.13. Ce montant correspond \u00e0 $1 la corde pour 748 \u2022 44 cordes de bois de pulpe, et 386,847 pieds de bois de sciage, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un total de $1,542.13, auquel il faut ajouter $100 pour une autre quantit\u00e9 de bois transport\u00e9e d'un endroit moins \u00e9loign\u00e9. Cette valeur en 1948 a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, reconnue et pay\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, et il n'y a pas lieu, je crois, de conclure qu'elle soit exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, car rien ne d\u00e9montre que les conditions aient chang\u00e9 en 1949, et que la jouissance de cette route ait une valeur diminu\u00e9e. Comme l'honorable Juge en chef Galipeault, cependant, vu le doute qui existe dans la preuve, je suis d'avis de r\u00e9duire le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,220.13, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'enlever $422, montant de travaux de r\u00e9parations que les d\u00e9fendeurs auraient eux-m\u00eames ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nA cause de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9, il est inutile de discuter les autres moyens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $1,220.13 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis le 19 ao\u00fbt 1950, date du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.

For the purpose of heating soup the boy was instructed by the teacher to light a gasoline stove, the property of the appellant trustees. In attempting to do so he was severely burned. In an action to recover damages for the injuries sustained the trustees at the trial, and the teacher on appeal, pleaded s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 135, which provides that no action shall be brought against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty in respect of any alleged neglect unless commenced within six months next after the act or neglect complained of. The trial judge held both the teacher and the trustees liable and fixed damages for injuries to the infant Gray at $8,000 and the expenses incurred by his father at $1,208.75; adjudged that the plaintiffs recover against the defendants $9,208.75, and directed that $8,000 of that sum be paid into Court to the credit of the infant.\nHeld: That the injuries were suffered as a result of the teacher\u2019s act of negligence and since the act was committed by her in the course of her employment both appellants were liable unless s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act applied.\nHeld: also, (Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Estey JJ. dissenting) that s. 11 did not apply.\nPer Taschereau, Rand and Cartwright JJ. The act which resulted in the injury was not one in the course of exercising any direct public purpose for the children: it had not yet reached any public aspect: it was an authorized act in a private aspect and therefore the Act did not apply. Griffiths v. Smith [1941] A.C. 170; Bradford v. Myers [1916] A.C. 242 and Clarke v. St. Helen\u2019s Borough Council 85 L.J.K.B. 17, referred to. Per: Locke J. The proper construction to be placed on the evidence was that the teacher intended to heat the soup for her own use and not for the children. She therefore was not performing or attempting to perform an act of the nature referred to in s. 11 and the section had no application.\nPer: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J. (dissenting). While the teacher\u2019s illness prompted the attempt to light the stove, the soup was to be used also for some of the pupils, and the use of the stove supplied by the trustees for the purpose of heating soup furnished by them to be partaken of by pupils as well as the teacher brought the case within the decision in Griffiths v. Smith, supra, and the trustees, therefore fell within the protection of s. 11 of the Act. As by s. 103 of The Public School Act, the teacher\u2019s duty was not only to teach but also to give assiduous attention to the health and comfort of the pupils, she was a public authority and entitled to the same protection.\nPer: Estey J. (dissenting). In the circumstances it could not be said that what was done by the trustees and teacher, acting in their respective capacities and supported by a grant from the government, was other than \u201can act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority\u201d with the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. The case upon its facts appeared to be an even stronger case in favour of the trustees and the teacher than Griffiths v. Smith, supra, and distinguishable from Bradford Corporation v. Myers, supra.\nHeld: further, that since the action was commenced before the 1949 amendment to the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, came into force, under s. 39 no appeal lay to this Court in respect of the sum of $1,208.75, leave not having been obtained from the Court of Appeal under s. 41. Dorzek v. McColl Frontenac Oil Co. [1933], S.C.R. 197.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeal (Hogg J. dissenting as to the liability of the defendant trustees) from the judgment of Wells J.[2] in favour of the respondents.\nG.W. Mason, K.C. and C.M. Smith, K.C. for the appellant trustees. The negligence alleged against the trustees in the Statement of Claim was that they had failed to see that the gasoline stove was kept in proper working order. There was no other allegation of negligence against them and there was no other allegation of negligence against the teacher. The case, therefore, upon which issue was joined was that made by para. 16 of the Statement of Claim, that \u201cthe burns to the infant plaintiff were caused as the result of the negligence, carelessness and breach of duty of the defendant trustees not seeing to it that the said gasoline stove was kept in proper working order having regard to the use that was to be made of the said stove as part of the said equipment by the said trustees for the school area.\u201d\nThe negligence complained of must be the causa causans of the injuries sustained, and it is clear from all the evidence that the negligence alleged, that is to say, the condition of the stove was not the cause of the accident. There was also the admission of counsel for the plaintiff when he said. \u201cThe negligence was not in the operation of the stove. It was letting an 11-year-old boy fool with matches and gasoline.\u201d It is to be noted that no such negligence was contemplated when the writ was issued, nor is there any allegation of such negligence in the original pleadings, or in the pleadings as amended, and it is submitted that the defendants were only called upon at the trial to meet the negligence charged in the Statement of Claim. This was recognized by the trial judge and pointed out by him to the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\nThe Court should not of its own motion set up a cause of action not disclosed by the pleadings. Andanoff v. Smith and Nadeff[3]. An amendment to set up such a case at this time would be barred by the limitations section of The Public Authorities Act. Mabro v. Eagle Star[4]; Schubert v. Sterlings Trust[5].\nIt would also mean that the plaintiff must rely on the maxim Respondeat Superior, as now applied. This rule does not apply in the wrongful or negligent acts of those engaged in the public service. 7 C.E.D. 233; Whitfield v. Le Despencer[6]; and inasmuch as Public School Trustees are public or quasi-municipal in character, it is the generally accepted rule that they are not liable for injuries resulting from negligence or failure to keep equipment in a proper manner, unless made so by statute. Corpus Juris Vol. 56, pp. 367, 528, 531. In any event the doctrine would only apply if the teacher was acting within her authority, or in the course of her employment. Griggs v. Southside Hotel Ltd.[7], and the action would have to be brought within six months. The Public Authorities Protection Act c. 132, s. 11. The duties of school trustees are set out in The Public School Act, c. 357, s. 89. In the absence of a breach of their statutory duty they should not be held liable. Scoffield v. North York[8]; Koch v. Stone Farm School[9]; Langham v. Governors of Wellingborough School and Fryer[10]; Urquhart v. Ashburton[11].\nIn Davis v. London County Council[12], it was held that the education authority was not liable for the negligence, if any, of persons performing operations on school children, provided they engaged competent professional persons to operate. See also Wray v. Essex County Council[13].\nIt has frequently been held that trustees are not liable if a reasonable standard of precaution is maintained. In the case at bar the trustees had done all the Public School Act required of them and therefore should not be held responsible for something which could not reasonably be foreseen. Chilvers v. London County Council[14]; Jones v. London County Council[15].\nThere is a further and fundamental reason why the action cannot succeed. It was not commenced within the time provided by s. 1 of The Public Authorities Protection Act. Levine v. Board of Education City of Toronto[16]; Griffiths v. Smith[17]; Greenwood v. Atherton[18].\nThe case of Bradford Corporation v. Myers[19] applied by Wells J. is distinguished in Griffiths v. Smith, supra. There the House of Lords held that The Public Authorities Protection Act did not apply because the act of contracting to see the coke to the purchaser, and of supplying it was purely voluntary. The sale was effected by a private bargain, with no correlative public duty and the corporation was unprotected.\nA.W.S. Greer, K.C. and C.L. Dubbin, K.C. for the appellant, McGonegal. The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the action against Hazel McGonegal was not barred by the provisions of s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act. In giving instructions for the preparation of hot refreshments for the pupils she was doing an act in pursuance or execution or intended execution of a statutory duty and that being so, afforded the full protection of s. 11. It must be remembered that the section does not take away from the plaintiffs any causes for action for any alleged wrong but prevents the action being instituted, if not commenced within six months after the injury is alleged to have occurred. The Court of Appeal erred in holding that because no statute imposed a duty on the teacher to supply hot meals that this section was not applicable. It is submitted that a proper test is where the act done by her was one permitted to be done and incidental to and forming part of her general duties and that if this were applied the section would be applicable. Nelson v. Cookson[20]; Greenwell v. Howell[21]; Freeborn v. Leeming[22]; Venn v. Tedesco[23]; Levine v. Board of Education of Toronto[24].\nIn the alternative, the trial judge erred in holding the defendant teacher responsible on the allegation of negligence which was not pleaded against her. In the further alternative, the trial judge erred in failing to find that the infant plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The fact that he was carrying out the instructions of his teacher does not relieve him of any responsibility for his own negligence. It must be remembered that he was a bright and intelligent boy and had been warned by his father not to touch the stove. Yachuk v. Blais[25].\nR.A. Hughes, K.C. and J.M. Kelly for the respondents. The first question in issue is whether the defendant McGonegal in instructing the infant plaintiff to light the gasoline stove in the circumstances was acting \u201cin pursuance of execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority . . .\u201d so as to bring her negligent conduct within the protection of The Public Authorities Protection Act. It is submitted that although she was acting within the course of her employment, she was not acting in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority. It was admitted in the pleadings of both defendants that she was the servant of the defendant trustees and it is clear from the evidence that they authorized her to serve hot food at noon hour during the winter months and would not disapprove of her doing so after the winter months even though she was using up supplies. It was left to her discretion and there was no obligation on her to serve hot food at the school at any time. In asking the infant plaintiff to light the gasoline stove for the purpose of heating some hot soup she was therefore clearly acting within the course of her employment, but not in the performance of some public duty or obligation or public authority so as to bring her conduct within the protection of the Public Authorities Protection Act. A servant of a public authority although acting in an official capacity under a power of the public authority, and acting within the course of employment is not protected by the Act if the alleged neglect or default occurs in the doing or not doing of some act voluntarily undertaken beyond the obligation, duty or authority imposed upon the public authority by statute. Clarke v. St. Helen\u2019s Borough Council[26]; Lyles v. Southend-on-Sea Corp.[27]\nThe defendant trustees were under no duty under the Public Schools Act, R.S.O. 1937, or any other statute known to them, to have hot food provided for the pupils. Can it be said that the defendant McGonegal in preparing to provide the hot soup was acting in pursuance or execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority? This duty in so far as the teacher is concerned is set out in s. 103 of the Public Schools Act. The trial judge found that on any fair reading of the section it could not be said that the serving of hot foods to the pupils was part of the statutory duties of a school teacher and the Court of Appeal were in agreement. The finding was that it was not at any time part of the statutory duty. The evidence goes much further in establishing that on the day in question the defendant McGonegal was doing so for her own purposes, because she was ill and to deplete the supplies on hand. In so doing, although she was acting within the course of her employment, she could not be fairly said to be doing so in order to carry out her obligations as a teacher under any statutory obligation to her pupils. Bradford Corporation v. Myers[28], approved in Griffiths v. Smith[29].\nThe supplying of hot food to the children was a purely voluntary act on both the part of the defendant trustees and the defendant McGonegal, and was something that went completely outside of the duties, in so far as the defendant trustees were concerned, of carrying on the school in conformance with the statute and, in so far as the defendant teacher was concerned, of carrying on her duties as a teacher in the school. It was not an act done as something incidental to, or part of, the process of carrying on the duties and authority under the Public Schools Act as a teacher. It was something that lay outside of that altogether. McDowall v. Great Western Ry. Co.[30]; Corby v. Foster[31]; Yachuk v. Blais[32]; Kelly v. Barton[33]; Williams v. Eady[34].\nAs to the second question in issue, whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to rely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior in charging the defendant trustees with the negligence of the defendant McGonegal, both defendants admitted in the pleadings that she was the servant of the defendant trustees. The only question which arises in this regard is whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to rely upon the doctrine in charging the trustees with her negligence due to the fact that the plaintiffs charged direct negligence against the trustees in para. 16 of the Statement of Claim. Hogg J. in his reasons for judgment states that the only foundation of any negligence on the part of the defendant trustees was that alleged in the Statement of Claim as direct negligence for their failure to properly maintain the equipment of the school and further that the plaintiffs did not at any time base their claim on the simple ground of the relationship between the trustees and the teacher of master and servant. It is submitted this finding is not justified, having in mind para. 6 of the Statement of Claim where it is alleged the defendant McGonegal was acting in the course of her employment. The only reasonable inference to be attached to this material fact, as pleaded, was that if she were negligent while acting in the course of her employment then her employer would of necessity by conclusion of law be charged with that negligence. If some further allegation is necessary in order to charge the trustees with her negligence committed within the course of her employment, it is submitted that leave should be given to amend the Statement of Claim. Leave was given at the trial to the trustees to plead The Public Authorities Protection Act, and in the Court of Appeal, to the defendant McGonegal. The application of this statute is the prime issue in this appeal. Zwicker v. Feindel[35]; Steward v. North Metropolitan Tramways[36].\nMason, K.C. replied.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The appellants, The Trustees of Leeds and Lansdowne Front Township School Area conduct a public school in the Province of Ontario. The respondent, Charles Gray, then twelve years of age, was a pupil in the school on June 12, 1947, at which time the teacher was the appellant Mrs. Hazel McGonegal. Charles was burned severely when attempting to light a gasoline stove and there is now no question that the injuries were suffered as a result of the teacher\u2019s negligence.\nMr. Justice Hogg considered that the only claim of negligence against the trustees was that contained in paragraph 16 of the statement of claim:\n16. The plaintiffs allege that the burns to the infant plaintiff were caused as the result of the negligence, carelessness and breach of duty of the defendant trustees not seeing to it that the said gasoline stove was kept in proper working order having regard to the use that was to be made of the said stove as part of the said equipment maintained by the said trustees for the said school area.\nHowever, in paragraph 6, it is alleged that the teacher \u201cacting in the course of her employment\u201d instructed the infant to light the stove, paragraph 16 was not referred to on the argument before this Court and, notwithstanding what appears in the factum filed on behalf of the trustees, counsel for all parties argued the case on the footing that if the doctrine of respondeat superior applied, the trustees were responsible for the teacher\u2019s negligence.\nIn any event, even if not formally admitted, there is really no doubt that both appellants are liable for the damages awarded by the trial judge unless absolved by s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 135, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. No action, prosecution or other proceeding shall lie or be instituted against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority, or in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such duty or authority, unless it is commenced within six months next after the act, neglect or default complained of, or, in case of continuance of injury or damage, within six months after the ceasing thereof.\nThis action by Charles\u2019 father as next friend of the infant, for damages for the latter\u2019s injuries, and on his own behalf for expenses, was not commenced within six months after June 12, 1947.\nIn Levine v. Board of Education of Toronto[37], Sedgewick J. dismissed an action for damages alleged to have been sustained at a public school athletic meet, conducted by the Board, at Exhibition Park in Toronto. He considered that if the Board was of opinion that in the interests of the children games should be arranged, it would be a duty of the Board to do so but that, in any event, the games were authorized and, therefore, the Board was entitled to the protection of the Act. An appeal from that decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal[38], but without any opinion being expressed as to applicability of the Act.\nThe Ontario section is in substance the same as s. 1 of the British Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, which has been considered in numerous cases in England, Scotland and Ireland, all of which, to the end of January, 1934, will be found referred to in The Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, by Mr. J.J. Sommerville. The House of Lords noticed some of them in Bradford Corporation v. Myers[39], where it was finally decided that the word \u201cperson\u201d must be limited so as to apply only to public authorities. There, the Corporation had power to carry on a gas undertaking and was bound to supply gas to the inhabitants of the district. In addition, it had statutory authority (which it was not bound to exercise) to sell the coke produced in the manufacture of the gas. It did so and a cart load of coke, in the course of being delivered to a particular purchaser was negligently shot through the window. It was held that the section did not apply because the act of contracting to sell the coke to the purchaser and of supplying it was purely voluntary.\nIn Griffiths v. Smith[40], Viscount Simon states that in the Court of Appeal the Master of the Rolls had explained the Bradford decision by saying:\nWhat they were doing in supplying coke was not something incidental to, or part of, the process of carrying on the gas undertaking and supplying gas compulsorily to the inhabitants. It was something that lay outside that altogether.\nIn the Griffiths case it was held that the managers of an elementary school were acting in pursuance of a public duty or authority when they invited the parents of the pupils to attend an exhibition of work held in one of the school buildings. While attending the exhibition, a parent was injured by the collapse of a floor, which was undoubtedly dangerous. Although the managers had acted voluntarily in authorizing the invitations to the school, in the sense that the school could have been carried on without the exhibition, it was held that the true test was: Were the managers, in authorizing the invitations, exercising their function of managing the school? While they had a discretion to authorize it or not, they did in fact approve it and did so in the course of carrying out their statutory powers of managing the school, and there was no ground for saying that the invitations were issued for some extraneous purpose unconnected with the management of the school.\nApplying these decisions to the circumstances of the present case, what do we find? The trustees were authorized by The Public Schools Act, R.S.O. 1937, as amended, and particularly s. 89, to see that the school was conducted according to The Public Schools Act and the regulations. There can be no doubt they are a public authority. For several years cans of soup and cocoa were supplied to the school and paid for by the trustees or their predecessors. The trustees and their predecessors had authorized the holder of the teacher\u2019s position, from time to time, to serve hot soup and cocoa although no formal resolution to that effect could be found. The Ontario Department of Education repaid to the trustees fifty per cent of the cost of the soup and cocoa. The gasoline stove had been in the possession of the trustees and their predecessors and was listed as part of the school equipment.\nThe practice was to commence heating the soup or cocoa during the morning recess so that it would be ready at noon. While this occurred generally in the cold weather, the seasons in which it would be done was left to the teacher\u2019s discretion, particularly bearing in mind that there might be a small stock on hand as the school term was drawing to a close. On the day in question, June 12th, the teacher did not feel well. She asked the pupils if they wanted soup but no one held up his hand. However, when she said that she was going to have some, and it turned out to be celery soup, then four or five agreed to take it. Therefore, while it was the teacher\u2019s illness that prompted the attempt to light the stove, the soup was to be used also for some of the pupils. Although there was no obligation on the part of the trustees to furnish refreshments, I am of opinion that in doing so, and in taking steps to heat them, the trustees through the teacher, within the principle of the Griffiths case, were exercising their function of conducting the school.\nIt has been pointed out in the Myers case and the Griffiths case that the determination of whether a public authority comes under the Act depends upon an examination of all the circumstances. This is exemplified in the different views taken in Clarke v. St. Helen\u2019s Borough Council[41], and Edwards v. Metropolitan Water Board[42]. While it is unnecessary to decide what would have been the result if the teacher had been the only one who was going to have the soup on June 12th, the use of the stove supplied by the trustees for the purpose of heating soup furnished by them, to be partaken of by pupils as well as the teacher, brings the case, in my view, within the decision in Griffiths, and the trustees, therefore, fall within the protection of s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act. As by s. 103 of the Public Schools Act, the teacher\u2019s duty was not only to teach (para. (a)) but also to give assiduous attention to the health and comfort of the pupils (para. (g)), Mrs. McGonegal is a public authority and is entitled to the same protection.\nThe appeals should therefore be allowed but only in part. In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge fixed the damages for the injuries to the infant Charles Gray at $8,000 and the expenses incurred by the father Willis Edwin Gray at $1,208.75, but the formal judgment adjudged that the plaintiffs Charles Gray and Willis Edwin Gray recover against the defendants $9,208.75 for damages and directed that $8,000 of that sum be paid into Court by the appellants to the credit of the infant. The action was commenced before the 1949 amendment to the Supreme Court Act came into force and, under s. 39 of R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, no appeal lies to this Court in respect of the sum of $1,208.75 since no leave was obtained from the Court of Appeal under s. 41. A similar situation arose in Dorzek v. McColl Frontenac Oil Co.[43] There, by one judgment an infant plaintiff recovered from the defendant $1,875, which was ordered to be paid into Court; his father recovered $284.25 and his mother $46.87. The mere fact that in the present case there is one judgment for the total of the two sums with a direction that the larger be paid into Court to the credit of the infant does not distinguish it from the case cited.\nThe father is therefore entitled in his personal capacity to retain his judgment against both appellants for $1,208.75 and costs of the action less any he may have been paid, or is entitled to, under an order of the trial judge whereby, as a term of permitting the trustees to plead The Public Authorities Protection Act, they were ordered to pay forthwith the respondents\u2019 costs of the action up to and including the preparation for trial. In view of the result and because of the fact that the appellant Mrs. McGonegal pleaded the statute only as a result of leave given her in the Court of Appeal, the respondents are entitled to their costs in that Court as against her. Under the circumstances there should be no costs in the Court of Appeal to or against the trustees. The appellants are entitled to their costs in this Court if demanded.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014The finding of negligence made by Wells J. at trial was concurred in by the Court of Appeal and was not seriously challenged before us. There remains the question of the applicability of The Public Authorities Protection Act, c. 135, R.S.O. 1937.\nThe evidence is clear both from the testimony of two pupils called by the defence as well as that of the infant plaintiff and the defendant teacher herself, that the latter, who that morning was ill, asked \u201cwho wanted soup for dinner and nobody wanted it but herself.\u201d Nothing that might have happened afterwards can affect that fact, notwithstanding that several of the children announced they would have some of the soup too \u201cif she were going to\u201d. The request or the direction thereupon given the young boy was for an act up to that moment for the purpose of the teacher and of the teacher only.\nNo regulation of the Department of Education nor any resolution of the School Board authorizing the giving of a course of warm food to the children was shown, and the authority rests upon oral instructions to the teacher from the trustees of the Board. But admittedly the Department has approved the practice over many years and has paid one-half of the expenses incurred. The predecessor Board purchased the stove and the gasoline can, and thereafter both that Board and its successor, the appellant, have borne the balance of the cost. It appears to be a general practice throughout the province, and as it concerns the health and comfort of the students, it would seem to be within the authority of the department, the board and the teachers to follow. At any rate, I would not presume that the moneys of the province have been improperly applied; and both defendants take the position that the practice was authorized by the school law. In the view I take of the case, however, I do not find that fact to be necessary to its determination. That the teacher should be able to make use of the stove for the purpose of heating food for herself has likewise been assumed; and in the circumstances before us, I should say it was an incident of her employment: Smith v. Martin and Kingston Corporation[44].\nThe question, then, is whether the act as I have described it was \u201cdone in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority\u201d as provided by s. 11 of the statute.\nAlthough the prior statutory background is somewhat different, the provisions of this section are substantially the same as those of the first paragraph of s. 1 of 56-57 Vict. c. 61 of the British Parliament, and the cases which have been decided by the English courts throw considerable light on the interpretation of this general language. Any difference based on the previous law would, I think, indicate a more restrictive interpretation of the Canadian Act. The question came before the House of Lords in Bradford Corporation v. Myers[45]. In that case, a municipal corporation was authorized by statute to carry on the undertaking of a gas company. It was bound to sell gas to the inhabitants of the district and was empowered to sell the coke produced in the manufacture of the gas. In delivering a load of coke, there was negligence which broke a shop window and caused other damage, and in an action brought against the corporation, the Act was pleaded. It was held that the delivery of coke was not in the exercise of a public authority and that the Act afforded no defence. The decision drew the line of the public service in the supplying of gas to exclude the disposal of the coke and the latter was treated as having the aspect of a private as distinguished from a public act. It is pointed out by Buckmaster L.C. that the language of the section implies that some authorized acts of public authorities are not \u201cpublic\u201d, although I do not take that to mean that under no circumstances could the entire authorized activities of a public authority be wholly of a public nature. Viscount Haldane used these words:\u2014\nMy Lords, in the case of such a restriction of ordinary rights, I think that the words used must not have more read into them than they express or of necessity imply, and I do not think that they can be properly extended so as to embrace an act which is not done in direct pursuance of the provisions of the statute or in the direct execution of the duty or authority.\nIn Clarke v. St. Helen\u2019s Borough Council[46], the facts were these. The defendants were constituted by statute the water authority for their district. They owned a motor car used for general purposes and particularly for taking about officials employed by them. The car, driven by the chauffeur and carrying the water engineer and a treasury clerk, was taken to visit three pumping stations to enable the engineer to examine the works and the clerk to pay the wages of the persons there employed. After these duties had been finished and while the car was being driven back to the garage, the engineer having left but the clerk still being in it, the driver negligently injured the plaintiff. It was held that the act of returning was not one happening in the course of executing a public authority, and that the statute did not apply: it was an internal act in the exercise of authority conferred with an incidental aspect. Swinfen Eady L.J. at p. 22 says:\u2014\nSuch acts as that of this chauffeur in driving this car are merely incidental to the execution of the defendant\u2019s statutory duty. They were merely incidental or ancillary acts. It is said that it is difficult to draw the line. In many cases, no doubt, it is; but I see no difficulty here.\nPhillimore L.J. put it thus:\u2014\nA man engaged merely to drive a car where he is told to drive it, is not necessarily engaged in the execution of any statutory duty.\nPickford L.J.:\u2014\nHe was not performing, as the servant of the corporation, nor was the corporation performing through him, an act in execution of any statutory or public duty, but was simply performing an act for the convenience of the corporation.\nIn Edwards v. Metropolitan Water Board[47], the facts were somewhat similar. There the Water Board used lorries driven by steam or petrol to take stores to depots and to bring back receptacles emptied of their oil or other materials. This distribution of stores was necessary for the expeditious repair of the works generally. It was held that injury negligently inflicted in the course of a return journey of the lorry carrying empty casks and drums was an act in the execution of a public duty, and that the statute applied. The Court of Appeal, consisting of Bankes and Scrutton, L.JJ., Younger L.J. dissenting, took the view that the outward and the return journeys of the lorry were all one and that it was taken directly pursuant to the statute. Younger L.J., on the other hand, after quoting Lord Buckmaster in the Myers\u2019 case, that the statute \u201cwas not intended to cover every act which a local authority had power to perform\u201d viewed the operation of the lorry as the fulfilment of a private contract rather than an act of public obligation or authority. On p. 309 he says:\u2014\nNow if the accident had taken place on the outward journey, I should I think have held, although even then the case would in my judgment have been very near the line, that the respondents were entitled to the protection of the statute. But the second question is much more difficult, (i.e. the return journey)\nand held the respondents not entitled to protection.\nThe question again came under the review of the House of Lords in Griffiths v. Smith[48]. In that case, the managers of a non-provided public elementary school, a statutory body, issued invitations to the plaintiff to attend an exhibition on the school premises of work done by the pupils, one of whom was the plaintiff\u2019s son. While the display was in progress the floor of the room collapsed through negligence in maintaining it in proper condition. The House found the statutory body to be a public authority within the statute, that the display was in the course of its authority, that the default was in the course of exercising its public duty, and that the statute was a good defence. In his speech, Viscount Maugham refers to Edwards v. Metropolitan Water Board, supra, with apparent approval, and Lord Porter similarly mentions Clarke v. St. Helen\u2019s Borough, supra.\nI have given the facts of these cases in some detail to indicate the strict application which the courts have from the outset made of this drastic enactment. The distinction made in Myers which confined the scope of the public service to those acts in direct performance of it, as contrasted with those of a private interest although incidental to the undertaking and authority as a whole, and in Clarke between primary and direct public acts and those which are subordinate or incidental to them, indicates the line of distinction for the purposes here. The serving of these meals in a public aspect is confined to the pupils, even though such a private concern of the teacher\u2019s may be said to have a remote interest for school administration generally. Whether she could properly partake of the supplies furnished by the School Board does not appear; but it is undoubted that this new measure was introduced not as a benefit to her but for the children. But the act which resulted in the injury was not one in the course of executing any direct public purpose for the children: it had not yet reached any public aspect: it was a private act, under a private authority. If it had been stopped before the third match was lighted, and nothing more done, no criticism could have been raised against the teacher, because the pupils had already said \u201cno\u201d to her question. If soup for some of the pupils had been put on the stove to warm, or they had shared in it, that subsequent action would be distinguishable; and if, for instance, in the course of heating it or of carrying it from the stove, a child had been scalded, then, doubtless, the contention would be much stronger that that act was in the execution of a public authority.\nFor these reasons the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nESTEY, J. (dissenting in part):\u2014Charles Gray, a pupil twelve years of age at the Legge School, suffered a serious injury on June 12, 1947, when, at the request of his teacher, he attempted, during the morning recess, to light a gasoline stove. In this action his father, Willis Edwin Gray, as his next friend, recovered at trial a judgment for damages caused by said injuries to Charles Gray in the sum of $8,000, and for his personal expenses $1,208.75\u2014a total judgment of $9,208.75 against both appellants, the teacher, Hazel McGonegal, and the trustees of the school. This judgment was affirmed on appeal. Mr. Justice Hogg, dissenting, was of the opinion that the appellant trustees, but not the appellant teacher, should succeed by virtue of s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 135). Both appellants appeal to this Court. The trustees, encouraged and assisted by a grant from the Provincial Government, provided equipment and supplies necessary to prepare hot soup and cocoa as a supplement to the pupils\u2019 noonday lunches. In 1946 the teacher commenced to supply them about December 1. With the advent of spring they were not provided every day, though it would appear from the evidence that the practice was more or less regularly followed up to June 12, the day in question.\nThe respondent, Willis Edwin Gray, was the janitor, but his son, Charles Gray, apparently did much of the daily work and was always asked by the teacher to prepare the fire at recess for the heating of the soup and cocoa. As to what happened on June 12, the teacher deposed:\nIt was recess and the children were all out, and as I repeat, it was a chilly morning and I was ill. I had suggested soup and as it has been said, no hands were raised, but when I said that I would have some myself at least five children said we will have some too, if it is going to be soup. They thought it was going to be cocoa or vegetable soup, and it happened to be celery soup. Two children said they would like some, and another child said, \u201cIf you are going to, I will too\u201d, and four or five said they would care for soup when they saw the soup.\nThis is the only reference the teacher makes to her illness. She does not state that she mentioned it to the pupils and certainly no pupil called as a witness made reference to it. The pupils, so far as they deposed to the foregoing, corroborate the teacher and not one of them contradicts her upon this, though at least some of them do upon other parts of her evidence. The learned trial judge stated:\nOn this occasion, it being late in the school year, the defendant, Hazel McGonegal, decided to use up her supplies of soup by heating them and distributing them among her pupils at lunch.\nWhether motivated by a desire to exhaust the supplies, as the end of the term approached and warmer weather prevailed, or whether it was her illness that prompted her to propose the soup does not determine the issue. We are concerned with her conduct and, upon the evidence here adduced, it would appear that she followed her usual routine, with no suggestion that a portion for but one should be prepared, but rather that all of the pupils who desired might enjoy a share. It would, therefore, appear that the evidence supports the basis accepted by the learned trial judge that what the teacher was doing was within the scope of her employment and in this the learned judges in the Court of Appeal were of the same opinion. Bowlby J.A. states:\nI am in entire accord with the conclusion of the learned trial Judge and am also of the opinion that the negligence of the defendant McGonegal fell within the scope of her employment and that the defendant trustees are liable therefor.\nThis issue was raised upon the pleadings and I am in agreement with the conclusions of the learned judges that at all times relevant hereto the teacher was acting within the scope of her employment.\nThe learned trial judge found that the teacher was negligent in that she failed to properly supervise the using of the gasoline stove, more particularly when she ought to have observed the difficulty Charles Gray was experiencing in his endeavours to light it. I am in agreement with the learned judges in the Court of Appeal that the evidence fully supports the finding of the learned trial judge both that she was negligent and that her negligence caused the injury suffered by Charles Gray.\nThe appellants, however, claim that this action was not brought within a period of six months after the injury suffered by Charles Gray. This action was not commenced until May, 1948, and, therefore, not until after a period of approximately ten months had elapsed since Charles Gray suffered his injury. Their contention is that under s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act they are protected from any claim arising out of this injury. S. 11 reads as follows:\u2014(As to which see page 282).\nThe trustees are a statutory corporate body under s. 63 of the Public Schools Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 357) and their position and duties as set forth in that act constitute them a public authority. The appellant teacher not only assumes public duties by virtue of her employment by the trustees, but also accepts the duties and responsibility imposed upon her by the Public Schools Act. In the circumstances it would seem that she also occupies a position such as to constitute her a public authority.\nThe foregoing s. 11 provides that \u201cNo action * * * shall lie or be instituted against any person * * * *\u201d This same phrase \u201cany person\u201d is contained in the act in Great Britain (Public Authorities Protection Act 1893, 56 & 57 Vict., c. 61, s. 1). In fact, s. 11 corresponds to, and is, in all material respects relevant hereto, to the same effect as s. 1 of the British Act. In referring to the latter, Lord Buckmaster pointed out that \u201c\u2018any person\u2019 must be limited so as to apply only to public authorities.\u201d Bradford Corporation v. Myers[49]. Viscount Simon, referring to this statement, said: \u201cOn this point the construction of the Act should be regarded as finally settled.\u201d Griffiths v. Smith[50]. However this phrase may be finally construed in Canada, I think both the trustees and the teacher are included within the phrase \u201cany person\u201d within the meaning of s. 11.\nThroughout the Act, various duties are imposed and powers provided in general terms. It was evidently the intention of the Legislature, in regard to many matters, that the trustees should exercise their discretion, not only as to what ought to be done, but also as to how that which was decided upon might be carried out. Though the regulations were not filed, there is, throughout, no suggestion that the trustees or teacher were exceeding their respective duties. In fact, the contention of the respondents is that the trustees and the teacher were acting in the discharge of their public duties, but, in providing the soup and hot cocoa, they were acting voluntarily rather than under any statutory obligation, their contention being that the provisions of The Public Authorities Protection Act apply only where there is a specific duty or obligation to be discharged by a person or body exercising a \u201cstatutory or other public duty or authority.\u201d\nIt is not essential that the duty or obligation be specifically stated. The trustees, in the discharge of their statuory or public duty of maintaining and conducting the school, had been encouraged by the Department of Education to accept the Government grant and to provide for the teacher the equipment and supplies. In all this they were exercising their discretion. They were not obligated to do so, but, in so far as they did, they were acting within the discharge of their statutory and public duty in relation to that school. In these circumstances it cannot be said that what was done by the trustees and teacher, acting in their respective capacities and supported by a grant from the Government, was other than \u201can act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority,\u201d within the meaning of s. 11 of The Public Authorities Protection Act.\nIn Greenwood v. Atherton[51], a child aged 5, attending a school, was injured in the playground during recreation period. As a consequence, an action was brought against the managers and the teachers, but commenced more than six months after the injury was suffered. It was held that the provisions of the Public Authorities Protection Act were applicable and the action was accordingly dismissed. Lord Goddard, at p. 392, stated:\nThese foundation managers are acting in pursuance of a public duty. It seems to me really quite unarguable to say that they are not a public authority and not acting in pursuance of a statutory duty, and, although it may be they could not be compelled to keep the school in existence, so long as they are in receipt of a grant from public funds I do not see how it can be said they are not public authorities, and for that reason I agree that this appeal must fail.\nIn Griffiths v. Smith, supra, the plaintiff, mother of a pupil attending the school, was among those invited by the headmaster, with the authority of the managers, to attend, upon the school premises in the evening and, therefore, after school hours, an exhibition of work done by the pupils. While in attendance she suffered an injury due to the negligence of the managers. She did not however, commence her action until long after the period permitted within the meaning of s. 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act and, therefore, the managers claimed the benefit of the provisions of that section. It was held that they were a public authority and that, notwithstanding there was no specific authorization of such exhibitions in any relative statute, in authorizing the invitations they were exercising their functions of managing the school. It was, therefore, held that they were entitled to the protection of the provisions of the act. In the presentation of the case it was contended that the exhibition was a voluntary undertaking, because not specifically authorized, and this was dealt with by their Lordships. Viscount Simon stated at p. 179:\nI entirely agree with this view, which has prevailed in both courts below. It would be within the discretion of the managers to decide whether they would approve such a display, or whether they would not.\nViscount Maugham described the finding of the trial judge that the exhibition was \u201cfor the purposes of a public elementary school\u201d as a \u201ccrucial finding of fact,\u201d which had been concurred in by the Court of Appeal. At p. 185 he stated:\n* * * it is not essential that a public authority seeking to rely on the Act of 1893 must show that the particular act or default in question was done or committed in discharge or attempted discharge of a positive duty imposed on the public authority. It is sufficient to establish that the act was in substance done in the course of exercising for the benefit of the public an authority or a power conferred on the public authority not being a mere incidental power, such as a power to carry on a trade. The words in the section are \u201cpublic duty or authority,\u201d and the latter word must be taken to have its ordinary meaning of legal power or right, and does not imply a positive obligation.\nTheir Lordships deal with and distinguish Bradford Corporation v. Myers, supra. Lord Maugham, at p. 183, states:\nThis House held that the corporation was not entitled to rely upon the Act of 1893 as a defence to an action for negligence brought by a purchaser of coke from the corporation * * * The ground of the decision as given by Lord Buckmaster was that the negligence was not in performance of \u201cthe direct execution of a statute, or in the discharge of public duty, or the exercise of a public authority\u201d; and he added that he meant \u201ca duty owed to all the public alike or an authority exercised impartially with regard to all the public.\u201d An incidental power to trade with the public was not, he said, within this qualification.\nThe case at bar, upon its facts, appears to be an even stronger case in favour of the trustees and the teacher than Griffiths v. Smith, supra, and is quite distinguishable from Bradford Corporation v. Myers, supra. The trustees and the teacher, in providing the soup and cocoa, were not carrying on a trade or some effort incidental to, but not in the course of, maintaining and conducting the school. On the contrary they were providing that which had proved to be desirable in the interests of the health and welfare of the pupils and the Government had deemed it proper to assist and, therefore, encourage the trustees to supplement the pupils\u2019 lunch by the provision of heated cocoa and soup, or such similar preparations as might, from time to time, be decided upon.\nThe judgment in favour of Willis Edwin Gray for his own personal expenses consequent upon his son\u2019s injury amounted to $1,208.75 and that in his favour as next friend $8,000. These are separate and distinct judgments. That in favour of Willis Edwin Gray, in his own right, not exceeding $2,000, cannot be appealed to this Court without leave (Supreme Court Act, ss. 36 and 41 as amended 1949, c. 37, s. 2). In Dorzek v. McColl Frontenac Oil Company, Limited[52], judgments awarded in a similar action were all less than $2,000 although in the aggregate they exceeded that amount. It was held that in these circumstances none of the appellants, apart from leave, could appeal to this Court. In the absence of leave this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the judgment in favour of Willis Edwin Gray and, therefore, the judgment in his favour for $1,208.75 must stand.\nThe appeal must be allowed with respect to the claim of Willis Edwin Gray, suing in his capacity as next friend for Charles Gray, and the judgment varied accordingly. I agree with the disposition of costs made by my brother Kerwin.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The appellant trustees were under s. 89 of the Public Schools Act (c. 357, R.S.O. 1937) charged, inter alia, with the duties of providing a teacher for the school in question and seeing that the school was conducted according to the Act and the regulations. The appellant McGonegal was the teacher provided and by s. 103 of the Act one of the duties imposed upon her was to give assiduous attention to the health and comfort of the pupils. It was apparently in accordance with these obligations that at the school in question, during the cold months of the year, cocoa and soup were supplied to the children at midday, part of the expense of this being borne by the school district and part by the Department of Education.\nThere are concurrent findings of fact as to the negligence of the appellant McGonegal. The appellant trustees as her employers are in law responsible for acts of negligence committed by her in the course of her employment. The question to be determined is whether s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 135) is a defence to the action which was not commenced within six months of the date of the commission of the act complained of.\nIf in fact the teacher had intended to prepare a meal for the children, in accordance with the practice that had been followed during the previous winter on the instructions and with the approval of the trustees, I think s. 11 would bar the action. It is not, however, in the view that I take of this matter, necessary to decide the point.\nThe appellant McGonegal\u2019s account as to her reason for directing that the soup be heated is expressed thus:\u2014\nIt was recess and the children were all out, and as I repeat, it was a chilly morning and I was ill. I had suggested soup and as it has been said, no hands were raised, but when I said that I would have some myself at least five children said we will have some too, if it is going to be soup. They thought it was going to be cocoa or vegetable soup, and it happened to be celery soup. Two children said they would like some and another child said, \u201cIf you are going to, I will too\u201d, and four or five said they would care for soup when they saw the soup.\nThe infant plaintiff apparently did not hear the teacher\u2019s inquiry as to whether any of the children wanted to have soup. Joyce Galbraith, a fifteen year old girl, said:\nMrs. McGonegal asked who all wanted soup for dinner, and nobody wanted it but herself.\nand when cross-examined she said that the teacher had asked any of the pupils to put up their hands if they wanted to have soup and that no hands were raised, whereupon the teacher had said that she was going to have it and asked young Gray to light the stove. Later she said that she had opened a can of soup for the teacher and, questioned as to a statement she had made before the trial to some unnamed person regarding the matter, said that she had told her about \u201cMrs. McGonegal wanting soup and not us.\u201d A younger child, Wallace Berry aged nine, said that at recess time the teacher had asked who wanted soup and that nobody had put up their hand. The only other evidence as to the occurrence was that of Robert Groves, a boy of thirteen, who said that the teacher had told Gray she wanted some hot lunches and wanted to light the gas stove so that she could get some soup ready. This boy also said that there was some soup left in the cupboard and that he guessed \u201cshe (the teacher) was cleaning them up.\u201d\nWells J. by whom the action was tried did not deal with this exact point but, after stating that it was customary to serve hot food to the children, particularly during cold weather, said:\u2014\nOn this occasion, it being late in the school year, the defendant, Hazel McGonegal, decided to use up her supplies of soup by heating them and distributing them among her pupils at lunch.\nIn my opinion, the proper construction to be placed upon this evidence is that Mrs. McGonegal intended to heat some soup for her own use and not for the purpose of providing hot food for the children and that it was after the soup proposed to be used was produced and was found to be a kind that they liked that some of the children said they would have some of it. It seems to me to be clear from her evidence that it was the fact that it was a chilly morning and that she was feeling ill that caused her to decide to have the soup heated and that, having decided this, she instructed young Gray to light the stove. In heating food for her own use the teacher was not performing or attempting to perform an act of the nature referred to in s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act and, in my opinion, the section has no application.\nOf the judgment recovered by the respondent at the trial less than $2,000 was awarded to the father and as to this, for the reasons given by my brother Kerwin, I think we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant McGonegal: A.W.S. Greer.\nSolicitor for the appellant Trustees: C.M. Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W.M. Nickle.\nREPORTER\u2019S NOTE: On May 26, 1952, a motion was made for an Order permitting the appellant trustees to submit further argument on the ground that the finding of the majority of the Court would exclude the principle of respondeat superior and that the appeal should therefore be allowed. K.G. Morden Q.C. for the motion, R.A. Hughes Q.C. for the respondents and C.F. Scott for the appellant McGonegal. The motion was granted and a re-hearing ordered upon arguments to be submitted in writing. On June 16, 1952 the following judgment was delivered. \u201cUpon motion a re-argument on certain points having been permitted the members of the Court see no reason to alter their respective opinions. The appellants, The Trustees of Leeds and Lansdowne Front Townships School Area, must pay the respondents the costs of the motion and of the argument. There will be no costs to or against the appellant Hazel McGonegal.\u201d\n[1] [1950] O.R. 512; 4 D.L.R. 395.\n[2] [1949] O.R. 749; 4 D.L.R. 344.\n[3] [1935] O.W.N. 415 at 417.\n[4] [1932] 1 K.B. 485 at 487.\n[5] [1938] O.W.N. 133.\n[6] 2 Cowp. 754.\n[7] [1947] O.R. 674.\n[8] [1942] O.W.N. 458.\n[9] [1940] 2 D.L.R. 603.\n[10] [1932] 101 L.J.K.B. 513 at 515.\n[11] [1921] N.Z.L.R. 164.\n[12] (1941) 30 T.L.R. 275.\n[13] [1936] 3 All E.R. 97.\n[14] (1916) 80 J.P. 246.\n[15] (1932) 96 J.P. 371, C.A.\n[16] [1933] O.W.N. 152.\n[17] [1941] 1 All E.R. 66.\n[18] [1939] 1 K.B. 388 at 392.\n[19] 1916] 1 A.C. 242.\n[20] [1939] 4 All E.R. 30.\n[21] [1900] 1 Q.B. 535 at 539.\n[22] [1926] 1 K.B. 160 at 165, 168.\n[23] [1926] 2 K.B. 227 at 229.\n[24] [1933] O.W.N. 152; 238.\n[25] [1949] A.C. 386.\n[26] [1916] 85 L.J.K.B. 17 at 21.\n[27] [1905] 2 KB. 1 at 13.\n[28] [1916] 1 A.C. 242.\n[29] [1941] A.C. 170.\n[30] [1903] 2 K.B. 331.\n[31] (1913) 290 L.R. 83.\n[32] [1949] A.C. 386.\n[33] 26 O.R. 608.\n[34] (1893) 10 L.T.R. 41.\n[35] 29 Can.

C.N.R., [1952] 2 S.C.R. 299\nDate: 1952-06-30\nStanley Flaherty (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian National Railway Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1952: March 4, 5; 1952: June 30.\nPresent: Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nNegligence\u2014Jury trial\u2014Conduct of trial\u2014Submission of questions to jury piecemeal\u2014Mistrial.\nThe appellant, a switchman employed in connection with a train movement in the respondent's yards at Saskatoon, suffered injury when attempting to enter the train after it had commenced to move. The appellant's claim was that the train had commenced to move without having received a signal from him and that this was a negligent act and was the proximate cause of his injury. A preliminary question as to whether the train had been started without such a signal having been given having been answered in the affirmative by the jury, the trial judge submitted a further question as to whether this was a negligent act and, if so, had it caused or contributed to the occurrence of the accident. The jury found for the appellant and awarded damages for which judgment was entered in his favour but the Court of Appeal directed a new trial on the ground that the conduct of the trial was unsatisfactory.\nHeld, Cartwright J. dissenting, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ.: The judge's charge when submitting the question as to whether the act complained of was negligent was made in terms which would tend to lead the jury to believe either that that question was the same as the preliminary question or that the trial judge had himself determined that it was a negligent act or that he was instructing them so to find. The conduct of the trial was in this respect unsatisfactory and the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting) : The course of putting one question to the jury and then permitting them to separate for the night before charging them as to the remaining questions is both unusual and undesirable, but the court was referred to no authority for the proposition that it is unlawful, and the decision in Fanshaw v. Knowles [1916] 2 K.B. 538 is to the contrary. As both parties had agreed to such course, the verdict should not be set aside on this ground since no miscarriage of justice had resulted. The charge to the jury was sufficient and contained no error of law. There was evidence on which it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to answer the questions as they did and their answers should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 ordering a new trial.\nW. G. Currie Q.C. for the appellant. Where the trial judge reasonably believes that the putting of the questions separately might lead to a saving of time and expense, he is justified in doing so. In England, by rule 431, that is expressly provided for. Such power in the court appears to be inherent and necessary. Emma Silver Mine Co. v. Grant 2. In the case of Patterson v. Saskatchewan Creamery Co. Ltd. 3, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge who had submitted further questions to the jury after he had found that the answers to the first questions submitted were not sufficiently explanatory. Rule 50 of the Rules of the Court of the Province of Saskatchewan purports to be based partly on rule 73 of the Ontario Rules, but appears to be wider. Under the Ontario Rule, it is held that the court may direct one or more issues of fact to be tried before the others: Waller v. Independent Order of Foresters 4.\nWhile the trial judge could have directed the questions to be put separately without reference to counsel, he only took this course as a suggestion to counsel and with the full concurrence of counsel on both sides. A litigant is bound by the way he conducts his case at the trial: C.P.R. v. Hanson 5, McDougall v. Knight 6 and Banbury v. Bank of Montreal 7.\nThe submission of the one question did not have the effect of removing from the jury their right to consider the entire evidence and decide whether or not there were other findings of negligence which were warranted by the evidence such as contributory negligence.\nThe answers of the jury should be given the fullest possible effect: Forbes v. Coca Cola Co. 8. The damages were not excessive and ought not to be disturbed: Warren v. Grey Goose Stage Ltd. 9.\nM. A. Mclntyre Q.C. and W. G. Boyd for the respondent. The cases referred by the appellant, on the question of putting the questions to the jury piecemeal, are not cases dealt by a jury but cases tried by a judge alone, and have therefore no relevancy. The dividing of questions is fatal as a matter of law. No case can be found to show that the court has not the competence to do so, but this seems to be a case where the trial judge should not have done it.\nThere is no evidence to support any finding of negligence against the respondent and in any event the evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant is so strong that the jury must have failed to act in a judicial manner in answering the questions as it did and its verdict is contrary to law, evidence and the weight of evidence.\nThe trial judge failed to explain to the jury the proper meaning of contributory negligence and apportionment of damages.\nThe damages are in no way supported by the evidence.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The appellant is a switchman employed by the respondent company and claims damages for personal injuries sustained by him on the early morning of November 18, 1949, while working in the railway yards in Saskatoon. The action was tried before the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench and a jury and, in view of the manner in which the issues were presented to the jury, it is necessary to consider in some detail the issues which were raised by the pleadings and the evidence given at the hearing.\nThe appellant had gone on duty at midnight and as a member of a switching crew had come from the railway yards at Nutana upon a light switch engine with which it was intended to move some 15 or 16 cars from their position in the yards of the respondent adjoining the station to a \"Y\" some 2\u00bd miles to the north to be turned. The equipment to be moved consisted of some 13 or 14 passenger cars, an express refrigeration car and a dining car, the latter two being the last two cars at the southern end of the train, the diner with its vestibule at the northerly end being the last of the cars. The appellant had descended from the switch engine when it was at a point at the southerly end of the train and proceeded to a position in the vicinity of the last two cars: the engine proceeded northward and coupled on to the cars preparatory to proceeding north. According to the evidence of the appellant, he had gone to the east side of the dining car at which time two express men employed by the respondent were loading bread from, a truck standing on the station platform on to the express car. While he was standing on the platform to the south of the truck, intending to signal with his lantern when the loading of the express car was completed, the train started to move whereupon he went to the rear of the dining car and turned the angle-cock which set the brakes and stopped the train.\nWhile the evidence is not entirely clear, apparently the train had moved about half a car length to the north when it was thus brought to a stop, whereupon the express men moved their truck into position and continued to load the car. After they had completed the loading and had moved the truck away from the car, the train started again. According to the appellant, he had not given any signal to start. McMurchy, another switchman who was a member of the crew, said that he did not see any signal from the rear of the train and the engineer, Brown, also said that he had not seen such a signal but had started to move the train either on the order of, or on a signal from, the switch foreman who was standing on the east side of the train to the south of the engine. As opposed to this evidence, both the express men who were within a few feet of the place where Flaherty was standing said that he had given a signal with his lantern before the train moved the second time, and evidence to the same effect was given by the switch foreman who said that he had received a go ahead signal from the rear of the train and then instructed the engineer to start. There is also conflict between the evidence of the appellant and the two express men as to his position when the train commenced to move. According to the appellant, he was near the rear of the dining car. According to James Read, one of the express men who was working inside the express car, Flaherty was just south of the door of the express car when he gave the signal with his lantern and was thus to the north of the north entrance to the dining car and waited for the dining car to come up to where he was standing before proceeding to enter. Edgar Lake, the other express man who was on the truck loading the bread on to the car, said that Flaherty was standing between the express truck and the north end of the diner and, after waving his lantern up and down, moved towards the diner and started to enter. In addition to the evidence given for the appellant as to the train having started the second time without any signal from him, a conductor employed by the respondent company, though not in connection with the movement in which the switching crew were engaged, said that in all train movements there is generally communication between members of the crew with the engineer by hand signals or lamps and expressed the opinion that the train should not have been started without such a signal from the appellant. It was in attempting to enter the north entrance to the diner that the appellant suffered the injuries complained of: across the entrance there was a cast iron bar some four feet above the level of the floor of the vestibule and which was shown to be standard equipment on such cars. Flaherty was aware that this was the case but, while there was sufficient light from the flood lights in the station to enable the express man Lake to read the labels on the goods they were loading, he, for some reason, failed to detect the presence of the bar and struck his face against it, breaking his glasses and causing injury to one of his eyes which necessitated its removal.\nThe statement of claim gave particulars of the alleged negligence which formed the basis of the action as follows:\n9. The said accident and injuries sustained were due to the negligence of the defendant and its servants (other than the plaintiff) and particulars of the said negligence are as follows:\u2014\n(a) In putting the said train in motion without a signal from the plaintiff so to do.\n(b) In putting the said train in motion without prior warning to the plaintiff,\n(c) In having the said cross-bar in the doorway of the said dining car at the time and place aforesaid.\n(d) In failing to warn the plaintiff of the presence of the said cross-bar. (e) In failing to signify the presence of the said cross-bar by lantern, light, luminous paint or other form of warning, in view of the dark conditions under which the said work was being carried out.\n(f) In failing to provide the plaintiff with a safe place in which to carry out his work.\n(g) In failing to furnish the plaintiff with safe conditions under which to carry out his work.\n(h) In failing to furnish the plaintiff with a safe system with which to carry on his work.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the learned trial judge stated that he had decided to put a preliminary question of fact to the jury which he said that he considered to be fundamental to the whole case, this being:\nDid the defendant put the train in motion just prior to the accident without a signal from the plaintiff so to do?\nCounsel for both parties agreed to this course and addressed the jury on the question. While the question propounded was merely whether the train had been started without a signal from the plaintiff and not as to whether to have done so would be a negligent act, the learned trial judge in addressing the jury, in advance of their consideration of the question, defined negligence and said that the respondent was liable for the negligence of its servants if injury resulted and that the burden of establishing negligence lay upon those that asserted it. This explanation would not appear to have been necessary at this stage of the matter in view of the form in which the question was to be put. While there may be some doubt as to whether the instructions given to the jury on the question of negligence led them to understand that they were to consider whether in the circumstances, assuming no signal had been given by the plaintiff, the defendant had been negligent, I think the concluding part of the instructions given would convey to them that their consideration was to be restricted to the exact question put since, after dealing with the matter of negligence, the learned trial judge said :\nNow on this question that you have to decide, it is for you to decide as to what witnesses to believe. You have seen these witnesses, you have heard them give their story. And it is for you from that story to decide where the weight of the evidence is and to give your verdict accordingly, on this question, the particular question of whether or not this train started without a signal from the plaintiff.\nwhich was followed by a review of the evidence pro and con. When the jury returned, in answer to a question by the clerk of the Court as to whether at least ten of them had : agreed on the answer to the question, the foreman said that the answer\nis a pretty unanimous \"Yes\", that the train was put in motion without a signal.\nFollowing this, the learned trial judge announced that he had prepared a number of further questions which he proposed to submit to them. The first two of these were:\n1. Having found that the train was put in motion without a signal from the plaintiff, was that an act of negligence on the part of the defendants and did it cause or contribute to the accident?\n2. If the answer aforesaid is \"Yes\", then in what way did it cause or contribute to the accident?\nCounsel for the appellant thereupon urged that further questions should be submitted dealing with the other counts of negligence pleaded but this application was refused, the learned trial judge saying that he would not have submitted the preliminary question to the jury, had he not been of opinion that all other questions were eliminated. Counsel for the respective parties thereupon addressed the jury. The judge's charge which followed contained the following passage:\u2014\nNow then, as the plaintiff did not give the signal to start, then it seems to me it was unquestionably an act of negligence on the part of the foreman to give the signal and therefore negligence on the part of the company, because the company is responsible for the acts of any member of the crew; even if that particular member is working in co-operation with the plaintiff, the negligence of the servant is brought home to the company and the company is responsible in law.\nYou are taking the law from me, and the first question that arises is the one that I first submitted to you : If you find this act of negligence on the part of the defendant company by virtue of the failure of he foreman to get a signal from the plaintiff, then did that act of negligence contribute in any way to the accident?\nIf by saying that \"the first question that arises is the one that I first submitted to you\" the learned trial judge intended to convey to the jury that the first of the questions then being submitted was the same as the preliminary question, this was clearly error. The questions as to whether the plaintiff had given a signal to start the train and whether to start without such a signal was a negligent act were entirely distinct matters, the second of which had not been submitted to the jury. If by this instruction the jury were led to believe that the questions were the same, having answered the preliminary question in the affirmative, to answer the first question then being submitted in the same manner would be merely perfunctory. If, on the other hand, they understood that the question as to whether such conduct would amount to negligence was still open, to instruct them that such conduct \"was unquestionably an act of negligence\" would unfailingly lead them to believe either that this question had been decided by the trial judge or that he was instructing them so to find.\nIn delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal (1), directing a new trial, the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan has said that in the opinion of the Court the conduct of the trial was unsatisfactory, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBeing of the opinion that in all the circumstances of this case there should be a new trial, I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nEstey J. :\u2014I agree that there should be a new trial and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 10 setting aside the judgment of Brown C.J., whereby it was adjudged that the plaintiff should recover $24,289 damages, and directing a new trial. The respondent cross-appeals asking that the action be dismissed.\nThe facts, so far as they are relevant to the decision of this appeal, may be stated briefly. On the 18 November, 1949, the appellant was employed by the respondent as a switchman. At about one o'clock in the morning he was engaged in certain duties at the rear end of a stationary train in the Saskatoon yards of the respondent. The last car was a dining-car. There were no steps or other equipment at the rear end of this car by which the appellant could board it. At the front end of the car there was an iron ladder of two rungs by which access could be had to the vestibule. Across the doorway to this vestibule was an iron bar, its height from the ground being 8 feet 7 inches. The car immediately ahead of the dining-car was a refrigerator car and once it was closed there was no way of boarding it. It was intended that when the loading of the refrigerator car was finished the appellant would signal with a lantern to the foreman, who was near the engine some six hundred feet to the north, and that the foreman would then instruct the engine-driver to start. The train was to be pulled about two miles for the purpose of being turned at a \"Y\". The appellant had duties to perform at the \"Y\". He intended to ride for this two miles in the coach immediately ahead of the refrigerator car, and did not intend to give the signal to start until he was ready to board the coach. The appellant asserted that the train started without his giving any signal and that although it was moving very slowly he boarded it hurriedly, getting on the front end of the dining-car instead of the coach. He got his feet safely on the rungs of the ladder but in pulling himself up to the platform or vestibule he struck his face on the iron-bar mentioned above. He was wearing glasses and unfortunately in the result he lost one of his eyes.\nThe main dispute of fact at the trial was as to whether or not the appellant had given the signal to start prior to the train starting. The foreman and other witnesses testified that he had. This fact was found by the jury in favour of the appellant, and there was evidence to support this finding.\nThe questions to the jury and their answers were as follows:\u2014\n1. Did defendant put the train in motion just prior to the accident without a signal from the plaintiff so to do?\nAnswer : Yes.\n2. Having found that the train was put in motion without a signal from the plaintiff was that an act of negligence on the part of the defendants and did it cause or contribute to the accident?\nAnswer: Yes.\n3. If the answer aforesaid is yes then in what way did it cause or contribute to the accident?\nAnswer: The defendant was negligent in putting the train in motion before the plaintiff gave a signal in that the action caused the plaintiff to move more quickly to board the train than would have been necessary for him (the plaintiff) to do so, had he (the plaintiff) given the signal for the train to move.\n4. What damages if any do you allow?\nAnswer :\n1. Special Damages \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $ 289.00\n2. General Damages \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 24,000.00 5. Was the plaintiff guilty of any negligence that contributed to the accident?\nAnswer: No.\n6. If so in what way did such negligence consist?\nAnswer :\n7. What is the degree of negligence in which the plaintiff and defendants are respectively at fault?\nAnswer: Defendants 100 per cent.\nSeveral grounds of negligence were alleged in the Statement of Claim but the learned Chief Justice ruled as a matter of law that there was no evidence to support any of them except the one found in favour of the appellant in the answers to questions 1 and 2. In regard to this allegation of negligence the position of the defendant was: (i) that the plaintiff did in fact give the signal to start; and (ii) that even if he did not do so the starting of the train was not a cause of his injuries as he had succeeded in getting safely on to the ladder leading up to the vestibule of the dining-car and his injury occurred when he was pulling himself up from the ladder at a time when any necessity for hurry had passed.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the learned Chief Justice decided to put a preliminary question of fact to the jury as to whether or not the plaintiff had in fact given a signal and question 1, quoted above, was put accordingly. As the learned Chief Justice had already ruled out all other allegations of negligence it is obvious that if the jury answered this question in favour of the defendant it would have been the end of the case. This course was followed without objection from either counsel.\nIn charging the jury on this question the learned Chief Justice gave them some instruction as to the law of negligence and pointed out to them that, as it was alleged to be negligence on the part of the foreman that he started the train without a signal, the onus lay on the appellant to satisfy the jury that he had not in fact given a signal prior to the starting of the train. No objection to the charge on this first question was taken by counsel for the defendant.\nThe jury, after deliberating, answered this question in favour of the appellant. The learned Chief Justice then permitted them to separate for the night and in the morning charged them as to the remaining questions. The Court of Appeal were of opinion that the conduct of the trial was unsatisfactory and that \"the submission of the questions to the jury piecemeal cannot be supported.\" After quoting the first question put to the jury by the learned Chief Justice the reasons of the Court of Appeal proceed as follows:\u2014\nIn doing so he stated that the question should be answered in the first place as, \"it is fundamental to the whole case.\" He also stated that the lack of a signal from the plaintiff was the first charge of negligence which had been alleged. The statement that the question of the signal was fundamental to the whole case indicated to the jury that this was the only matter of negligence which appeared in the case and the effect of the submission of the one question was to remove from the jury their right to consider the entire evidence and decide whether or not there were other findings of negligence which were warranted by the evidence. Moreover, the selection of the one question would create in the minds of the jury the impression that in the opinion of the trial judge, if the plaintiff had not given the signal, there was negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to the accident. It is pointed out that counsel for both parties agreed to the question being submitted\u2014even so statements made by the trial judge in the presence of the jury and in his final address to the jury amounted to instructions that the starting of the train without a signal from the plaintiff was negligence. The jury was not given an opportunity after proper instruction to answer the question :\n\"Q. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant or its servants which caused or contributed to the accident?\"\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered, the costs of the first trial to abide the event of the second. There will be no costs of the appeal.\nThe course of putting one question to the jury and then permitting them to separate for the night before charging them as to the remaining questions is, I think, with great respect, both unusual and undesirable, but we were referred to no authority for the proposition that it is unlawful, and the decision of the Court of Appeal in Fanshaw v. Knowles 11 is to the contrary. Before adopting this course the learned Chief Justice suggested it to counsel and, far from objecting, both counsel expressly agreed that it should be followed. Under these circumstances the verdict should not be set aside on this ground unless it were clear that a miscarriage of justice had resulted.\nIt is true that it was not strictly necessary that the learned Chief Justice should instruct the jury as to the law of negligence when they were dealing with the first question which was solely one of fact and I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal and with counsel for the respondent that the jury would understand from the charge that if the train was started without any signal from the appellant this was negligence ; but I do not regard this as important, for the whole conduct of the trial indicates that the respondent did not seriously contend that if the foreman started the train without a signal his conduct in so doing was not negligent. The defence in this regard was that the appellant in fact gave the signal, but that if this fact was found against the defendant the foreman's act did not cause the plaintiff's injury. On the evidence the jury could not reasonably have found that to start the train without a signal was not negligent. The foreman himself in answering questions put to him by the learned Chief Justice expressly stated that he should always wait for a signal from the rear end before instructing the engineer to start, and that to do otherwise would be a mistake. This, I think, accounts for the fact that counsel for the defendant made no objection to the charge.\nIt appears to me that in his final charge the learned Chief Justice dealt correctly and adequately with every point upon which the defence relied and particularly that he made it perfectly clear to the jury that their finding that the foreman started the train without a signal did not fix the defendant with any liability unless they were satisfied that such conduct was a cause of the plaintiff's injury. The form of question 2 also indicates this. Without attempting to quote all that the learned Chief Justice said on this point, I refer to the following passage:\u2014\n.... It is not sufficient to find there was an act of negligence ; you must find that act of negligence either caused or in some way contributed to the accident. The mere fact a signal has not been given does not necessarily mean the defendant company is liable here. The plaintiff says it did contribute to the accident; he says, \"If I had given the signal I would have put myself in a position where I was sure of my footing, where I would not have been rushed and could get secure footing on the train and would not have to act under any emergency.\" The defendants say: \"Well you didn't have to act under any emergency; this train started very slowly, you were in just as good a position to secure proper footing on the train and safeguard yourself as if you had given the signal.\" That is what the defendants contend. It is for you to say in the light of the evidence whether or not that is so. And if you say that the failure to give that signal was the cause or contributed to the accident, then you are asked to go on and say, in what did that consist; in what way did that contribute. The instructions as to contributory negligence and the assessment of damages are sufficient and satisfactory. Indeed, if I may be allowed to say so, the final charge appears to me to put every aspect of the problem before the jury with admirable clarity and I am not surprised that neither counsel asked the learned Chief Justice to amend or add to it in any way.\nIt is next necessary to consider the submission of the respondent that on all the evidence the answers of the jury to questions 2 and 5 were perverse and should be set aside. After perusing the whole record I think there was evidence on which it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to answer these questions as they did and that their answers should not be disturbed. It is unnecessary to repeat that the question for an appellate court is not whether it agrees with the conclusions reached but rather whether the jury, the constitutional tribunal of fact, acting reasonably and judicially, might have come to such conclusions.\nThere remains the submission that the damages awarded are excessive. At the date of the accident the appellant was twenty-two or twenty-three years of age. An operation was performed on the day of the accident in an attempt to save the eye but this proved unsuccessful and the eye had to be removed four weeks and two days later. During this period the appellant endured severe pain. The doctor who performed the operation stated that the loss of one eye usually results in extra strain on the remaining eye. The $24,000 awarded for general damages included $1,918.19 for lost wages. The amount awarded may appear large but the loss of an eye is a serious matter for a man in his early twenties, and I am quite unable to say that the amount is so large as to indicate that the jury failed to act reasonably and judicially in making the assessment.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout and I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The rule as stated in Cooper v. Slade (1858) 6 H.L.C. 746 and in Clark v. The King (1921) 61 Can. S.C.R. 608 at 616, applies, Mordaunt v. Moncreiffe (1874) L.R. 2 Sc. & Div. 374; Branford v.

P.C. 502 at 532, referred to.\nAPPEAL by the petitioner from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (O'Halloran J. dissenting), dismissing an appeal from the trial judgment dismissing the petition.\nI. Shulman for the appellant. The trial judge erred in that he failed to make findings of fact and credibility and in applying the case of Stuart v. Stuart [1]. That case can have no application as it deals with the law in cases where inferences are required to be drawn from circum\u00adstantial evidence; and the evidence herein was direct evidence. That case holds that \"The same strict proof is required in the case of a matrimonial offence as is required in connection with criminal offences properly so-called.\" It is wrong. It follows De Voin v. De Voin [2], a unanimous decision based solely upon the dictum of Lord Merriman in Churchman v. Churchman,[3]. It is quoted three times and referred to a fourth in Stuart v. Stuart, leaving no doubt that the Court of Appeal in this case held that the criminal standard of proof is required in order to prove adultery in a matrimonial cause. (2). 304. (3)The words \"evidence which clearly satisfies me beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the respondent and co-respondent\", used by the trial judge clearly imply, at least in this country, that he was applying the criminal standard of proof; a fortiori when these words are con\u00adnected with and therefore explained by the reference to the onus required by Stuart v. Stuart.\nIt is wrong in law to require the criminal standard of proof in order to prove adultery in a matrimonial cause; that is, it is not correct to say that \"The same strict standard of proof is required in the case of a matrimonial offence as is required in connection with criminal offences properly so-called.\"\n(a) Adultery is not a crime. The criminal standard should not apply in a criminal proceeding.\n(b) A fortiori the criminal standard should not apply on the grounds that it is a quasi-criminal offence.\n(c) The word \"satisfied\" is used in the Act. It would have been easy to add the words \"beyond all reason-able doubt\" if that is what was in the \"mind\" of Parliament. There is no justification for adding such a distinctly qualifying phrase.\n(d) The criminal standard of proof is neither required or justifiable as a matter of public policy to protect the interests of the State, society or the individual.\n(e) The criminal rule was formulated out of the high regard which the law has for the liberty of the individual. The same is not called for in divorce suits where the court is concerned, not to punish anyone, but to give statutory relief from a marriage which has broken down.\n(f) The authority of Ginesi v. Ginesi[4] upon which Stuart v. Stuart leans, in part, has been doubted in England.\n(g) In Ontario and Saskatchewan, at least, of the Provinces in Canada, the civil standards has been clearly held to be sufficient: and this is the view preferred in Australia and in the United States Briginshaw v. Briginshaw[5]\n[Page 314].\nIn order to determine the principles regulating the standard of proof in the divorce court, it is necessary to go to the provisions of the statute, which in this case is the Marriage Act 1928. S. 80 is as follows: \"Upon any petition for dissolution of marriage, it shall be the duty of the court to satisfy itself, so far as it reasonably can, as to the facts alleged and also to inquire into any counter-charge which may be made against the petitioner.\"\nS. 86 \"Subject to the provisions of this Act, the court, if it is satisfied that the case of the petitioner is established, shall pronounce a decree nisi for dissolution of marriage.\" The phrase \"it shall be the duty of the court to satisfy itself, so far as it reasonably can\" is also used in s. 81. The sections directly relevant are ss. 80 and 86. S. 80 is a governing section applying to all the facts alleged as grounds for a petition for divorce-adultery, desertion etc. So far from the legislature having used the phrase \"satisfy itself beyond a reasonable doubt\" or any similar phrase, the legislature has simply used the word \"satisfy\". It can be assumed that the legislature was aware of the difference between the civil standard of proof and the criminal standard of proof. It would not be a reasonable interpreta\u00adtion of s. 80 to hold that the words \"satisfy itself\" meant \"satisfy iself beyond a reasonable doubt\". But the actual phrase is not merely \"satisfy itself\" but \"satisfy itself so far as it reasonably can\". The addition of the words \"so far as it reasonably can\" strongly supports the view that the legislature did not intend the court to reach that degree of moral certainty which is required in the proof of a criminal charge. The words are apt and suitable for applying in the new jurisdiction the civil standard of proof, but they are not apt words of description for the criminal standard of proof. In s. 86 the words are \"The court, if it is satisfied that the case of the petitioner is established, shall pronounce a degree nisi\". These words, like those in s. 80, are applicable to all the grounds upon which a petition can be presented. If they require the criminal standard of proof in the case of adultery, they also require that standard of proof in the case of desertion-a propo\u00adsition which has no authority to support it. The result is that the ordinary standard of proof in civil matters must be applied to the proof of adultery in divorce proceedings, subject only to the rule of prudence that any tribunal should act with much care and caution before finding that a serious allegation such as that of adultery is established. Dearman v. Dearman [6]; Wright v. Wright [7]; George v. George and Logie[8].\nP. Murphy for the respondent. The trial judge dismissed the petition on the basis that the petitioner had not discharged the onus of proof cast upon him by the decision in Stuart v. Stuart[9] i.e. that the petitioner had not laid before the trial judge evidence which satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal sustained the decision and dismissed the appeal. The Chief Justice interpreted the reasons of the trial judge to mean that because of the conflict of evidence the trial judge was unable to find as a fact that the petitioner had discharged the onus of proof upon him to prove the adultery alleged beyond a reasonable doubt and that in that sense the trial judge had properly relied upon Stuart v. Stuart. The Chief Justice further stated that he could not say that the conclusion of fact of the trial judge based as it was upon the evidence before him and the advantage of the view he had and the demeanor of the witnesses, in a word the surrounding circumstances, was so clearly erroneous that the Court of Appeal should interfere. Mr. Justice Robertson concurred. Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented in part hold\u00ading that Stuart v. Stuart did not apply except in cases where the adultery was to be inferred from the circum\u00adstances, and would have directed a new trial so that the trial judge could make proper judicial findings on credi\u00adbility which he found were lacking.\nIn De Voin v. De Voin [10] the Court of Appeal followed the law as laid down in Churchman v. Churchman, [11] by Lord Merriman P. who said \"The same strict proof is required in the case of a matrimonial offence as is required in connection with criminal offences properly so called\". The same Court had occasion to review this aspect of the law in Stuart v. Stuart where a number of authorities bear\u00ading on the issue were considered-Loveden v. Loveden[12] ; Allen v. Allen and Bell [13] ; FitzRandolph v. FitzRandolph[14]; L. v. L. and K.[15] ; Churchman v. Churchman, supra; Ginesi v. Ginesi [16]\nIn Davis v. Davis[17] the principle in Churchman v. Churchman seems to be adopted by the Court of Appeal in England.\nIn Fairman v. Fairman[18] Lord Merriman giving judg\u00adment for himself and Ormerod J. stated that in Ginesi v. Ginesi the Court of Appeal unreservedly approved the observation made by him in Churchman v. Churchman in relation to a charge of adultery, including as Wrottesley L.J. expressly said, connivance, while leaving open the question whether the current generality of the observation applied to other matrimonial offences. Here again, insofar as adultery is concerned, that principle is laid down as the standard of proof required. It must be noted that this was a case where direct evidence of adultery was involved. This case seems to be in harmony with the decision of the Court of Appeal, at bar, to the extent that in applying the principles, no distinction is to be drawn, whether or not the evidence of adultery is direct or circumstantial.\nThe latest decision on the point is Preston-Jones v. Preston-Jones [19] in which the House of Lords seemed to accept and enunciate the principle that where it was sought to prove adultery th\u00e9 law demanded that the same be established beyond all reasonable doubt. In Gower v. Gower [20] Denning L.J. by way of obiter dicta seems to cast some doubt on the principles set out in the Ginesi case. Ontario formerly adopted the standard laid down in Churchman v. Churchman; DeFalco v. DeFalco[21] ; Jones v. Jones[22]. In Robertson v. Robertson [23] the view of Hogg J.A. seemed to be that adultery could not be regarded as criminal or quasi-criminal, but that a high standard of proof is required in divorce cases. In George v. George [24], Roach J.A. giving judgment for the Court, reviewed all the authorities and said \"the standard of proof is not that imposed upon the Crown in a criminal prosecution, but is the standard required in a civil action only. The judicial mind must be 'satisfied' that the alleged act of adultery was in fact committed, but it need not be satisfied to the extent of a moral certainty as in a criminal case. Evidence that creates only suspicion, surmise or conjecture is, of course insufficient. It is necessary that the quality and quantity of the evidence must be such as leads the tribunal -be it judge or jury-acting with care and caution, to the fair and reasonable conclusion that the act was committed.\" In Bruce v. Bruce [25] the Court of Appeal in Ontario decided that where adultery was to be inferred from circum\u00adstances, it was not correct to say that the circumstances adduced in evidence not only must be consistent with the commission of the act of adultery, but must be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\nIt is submitted, therefore that the test applied by the trial judge that the allegations of adultery should be proved beyond a reasonable doubt was not misdirection, but that he directed himself properly in accordance with the law that is in effect in Canada, and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nI. Shulman in reply.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2011\nLOCKE J.:-This is an appeal by the petitioner in a divorce action from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[26]), dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Wilson J. which dismissed his petition: O'Halloran J.A. dissented and would have directed a new trial.\nBy the petition the appellant asserted that his wife had at various times committed adultery with the co-respondent and claimed a dissolution. These allegations were put in issue by the pleadings filed by the respondent and the co-respondent. It is sufficient to say of the evidence adduced at the trial that there was, what must be exceed\u00adingly rare in actions of this nature, direct evidence of the commission of the marital offence given by the petitioner and another eye witness and in addition evidence of other circumstances from which adultery might have been in\u00adferred. The direct evidence was denied by the respondent and the co-respondent as was the fact that they had at any of the times complained of been guilty of adultery.\nIn dismissing the petition Mr. Justice Wilson said that the petitioner had not brought forward evidence which satisfied him beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the respondent and co-respondent and, considering himself to be bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Stuart v. Stuart[27], the action failed.\nIn the Court of Appeal the Chief Justice of British Columbia, with whom Mr. Justice Robertson agreed, con\u00adsidered that, in view of the reasons delivered by the learned trial judge, the matter was governed by the decision in Stuart's case. Mr. Justice O'Halloran was of the opinion that the decision in that case did not apply where there was, as in the present case, direct evidence of the commission of the marital offence, while in Stuart's case and an earlier case of De Voin v. De Voin [28], where the Court had arrived at the same conclusion on a point of law, the evidence was circumstantial.\nBy the English Law Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 111) the civil and criminal laws of England, as the same existed on the 19th day of November 1858 and so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable, are in force in the Province of British Columbia, save to the extent that such laws shall be held to have been modified or altered by legislation having the force of law in the province or in any former colony comprised within the geographical limits thereof. The statute conferring jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of British Columbia in divorce and matrimonial causes is The Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 (Imp.) (20-21 Vict. c. 85) as amended by 21-22 Vict. c. 108 .and it was under the terms of that statute that the proceedings in the present action were taken. The latter statute provides that in all suits and proceedings other than proceedings to dissolve any marriage the court should proceed and act and give relief on principles and rules which, in the opinion of the court, should be, as nearly as may be, conformable to the principles and rules on which the ecclesiastical courts had theretofore acted and given relief, subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and rules or orders made under it. The ecclesiastical courts, while empowered to grant divorce \u00e0 mens\u00e2 et thoro were without jurisdiction to dissolve a marriage, relief which could in England be obtained only by an Act of Parliament. The Act of 1857 declared, inter alia, that it should be lawful for ,any husband to present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground that his wife had since the celebration thereof been guilty of adultery and provided that:\u2011\nIn case the Court shall be satisfied on the evidence that the case of the petitioner has been proved, and shall not find that the petitioner has been in any manner accessory to or conniving at the adultery of the other party to the marriage, or has condoned the adultery complained of, or that the petition is presented or prosecuted in collusion with either of the respondents, then the Court shall pronounce a decree declaring such marriage to be dissolved.\nThe question to be determined is whether, in order to find that the case of the petitioner has been proven, the court must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that adultery has been committed, or whether, as in the case of other civil proceedings, the Court may act on what Willes J. described in Cooper v. Slade [29], as the \"preponderance of probability\" or, as expressed by Duff J. (as he then was) in Clark v. The King[30], \"on such a preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion the party seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the possible view of the facts.\"\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in De Voin v. De Voin supra, adopted as an accurate statement of the law a passage from the judgment of Lord Merriman P. speaking for the Court in Churchman v. Churchman [31], reading :\u2011\nThe same strict proof is required in the case of a matrimonial offence as is required in connection with criminal offences properly so called. In the interval between this decision and that in Stuart's case a divisional court in England had adopted and followed Lord Merriman's statement of the law in the case of Ginesi v. Ginesi [32], a judgment later affirmed by the Court of Appeal [33]\nWhile in Allen v. Allen [34], Lopes L.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a case where the evidence was circumstantial, had said in part (p. 252) :\u2011\nA jury in a case like the present ought to exercise their judgment with caution, applying their knowledge of the world and of human nature to all the circumstances relied on in proof of adultery, and then determine whether those circumstances are capable of any other reasonable solution than that of the guilt of the party sought to be implicated.\nI have been unable to find any decision either in England or in Canada where, prior to the judgment in Churchman's case, it has been said that the standard of proof required in the case of a matrimonial offence was that required in criminal cases, this irrespective of the nature of the\nmatrimonial offence or whether the evidence was circum\u00adstantial or direct.\nIt is of importance to note that the point which Lord Merriman was considering in Churchman's case was as to whether there was evidence of connivance between the parties to the action and that, in so far as his statement of the law related to or could be related to other matrimonial offences such as adultery, it was simply obiter. The passage ' referred to must be read with its context: after discussing the question as to whether the burden of proof in relation to connivance had been shifted by some recent statutory enactments in England, Lord Merriman said (p. 51)\nBut it is not necessary to express any final opinion on the question where the burden of proof lay under the earlier Acts or on the reasons for the change in the wording. Assuming that the present Act deliberately imposes a new burden on the petitioner this cannot in our opinion mean that there is now a presumption of law that he has been guilty of connivance. The same strict proof is required in the case of a matri\u00admonial offence as is required in connection with criminal offences properly so called. Connivance implies that the husband has been accessory to the very offence on which his petition is founded, or at the least has corruptly acquiesced in its commission, and the presumption of law has always been against connivance.\nWhile support for the view that some higher degree of proof was necessary on the issue of connivance might have been found in the judgment of Dr. Lushington in Turton v. Turton [35], in my humble opinion the application of the principle to the marital offence of adultery is not supported by authority.\nThe appeal in Ginesi v. Ginesi was first heard before a divisional court consisting of Hodson and Barnard, JJ. The trial had been before the Bradford justices and the proceedings are not reported. A separation order obtained by the wife by reason of her husband's wilful neglect to maintain her was discharged on the ground that she had committed adultery. After saying that the justices had apparently not been alive to the standard of proof requisite in a case of that class, Hodson J. said in part (p. 438) :\u2011\nIt is a matter of history that in matrimonial cases, adultery having been described as a quasi-criminal offence, the standard of proof is a high one, and if authority is required it is to be found in the language used by Lord Merriman, P., in Churchman v. Churchman.\nand quoted the statement which had been adopted in the De Voin and Stuart cases: he then proceeded to say that the error made by 'the justices was in thinking that the standard of proof required was that in an ordinary civil case where merely the \"preponderance of evidence, or even the balance of probability\" might be applied. Barnard, J. agreed that this was error. On the appeal to the Court of Appeal, counsel for the husband apparently conceded the correct\u00adness of the rule as stated by Lord Merriman, as applied to the charge of adultery. Tucker, L.J., however, considered some of the early authorities such as Rix v. Rix [36]; Wil\u00adliams v. Williams[37] and Loveden v. Loveden [38], which I will refer to later, and certain remarks of Lord Buckmaster and Lord Atkin in Ross v. Ross[39], and decided that Hodson J. was correct in saying that adultery must be proved with the same degree of strictness as is required for the proof of a criminal offence. Wrottesley L.J. agreed that the rule applied to cases of adultery, leaving it to other occasions to decide whether it was equally applicable to other matrimonial offences \"in addition, of course, to connivance, the offence which Lord Merriman P. must have had in mind in Churchman v. Churchman.\" Vaisey J. expressed his complete agreement with the other members of the Court and said (p. 186) :\u2011\nThe close similarity of the offence of adultery to acts which are properly to be described as criminal today is beyond question.\nIn Fairman v. Fairman [40], Lord Merriman, P., dealing with a case where the offence charged was adultery, after noting that what he had said in Churchman's case had been adopted and followed in the Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal in Ginesi's case, said that he would like to add that he had always directed himself and directed juries that adultery is a quasi-criminal offence and that, therefore, the same principles should be applied as in the case of criminal offences properly so called but that, in relation to offences such as desertion, cruelty or wilful neglect to provide reasonable maintenance, he had never charged that the same strictness applied.\nIn Preston-Jones v. Preston-Jones[41], an action for divorce which would result, if successful, in bastardising a child, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ginesi v. Ginesi was referred to by Lord Morton and Lord MacDer\u00admott. Certain statements made in other judgments delivered in the matter are also to be noted. Lord Simonds who did not refer to Ginesi's case said in part (p. 127) :\u2011\nA question was raised as to the standard of proof. The result of a finding of adultery in such a case as this is in effect to bastardise the child. That is a matter in which from time out of mind strict proof has been required. That does not mean, however, that a degree of proof is demanded such as in a scientific inquiry would justify the conclusion that such and such an event is impossible. In this context at least no higher proof of a fact is demanded than that it is established beyond all reasonable doubt.\nand referred to Head v. Head [42]). Lord Oaksey, after referring to the nature of the proceedings, said (p. 133) in such circumstances the law, as I understand it, has always been\nthat the onus on the husband in a divorce petition for adultery is as heavy as the onus which rests on the prosecution in criminal cases. That onus is generally described as being a duty to prove guilt beyond reason-able doubt, but what is reasonable doubt is always difficult to decide and varies in practice according to the nature of the case and the punishment which may be awarded. The principle on which this rule of proof depends is that it is better that many criminals should be acquitted than that one\n[Page 323].\ninnocent person should be convicted. The onus in such a case as the present, however, is founded, not solely on such considerations, but on the interest of the child and the interest of the State in matters of legitimacy since the decision involves not only the wife's chastity and status but in effect the legitimacy of her child: see Russell v. Russell [43].\nLord Morton said that (p. 135)\nIn Ginesi v. Ginesi [44] the Court of Appeal, after a survey of the authorities, held that a petitioner must prove adultery \"beyond reason-able doubt.\" In my view, the burden of proof is certainly no heavier than this, and counsel for the husband did not contend that it was any lighter.\nLord MacDermott, after saying that for the wife it was contended that as the finding of adultery would in effect bastardise the child and that it was conceded that the adultery alleged had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, expressed views which, it appears to me, went beyond the issues involved in the appeal. Section 4 of the Matri\u00admonial Causes Act 1937 requires the Court, on hearing of a petition for divorce, to pronounce a decree if \"satisfied on the evidence\" that the cause for the petition has been proved. Lord MacDermott, after referring to a passage in the judgment of Viscount Birkenhead, L.C. in Gaskill v. Gaskill[45], a case involving legitimacy, where it was said that there should be a decree only if the court comes to the conclusion that it was impossible that the petitioner should be the father of the child, and stating his disagreement with that view said (p. 138) :\u2011\nThe evidence must, no doubt, be clear and satisfactory, beyond a mere balance of probabilities, and conclusive in the sense that it will satisfy what Sir William Scott described in Love den v. Loveden[46] as \"the guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man,\" but these desiderata appear to me entirely consistent with the acceptance of proof beyond reasonable doubt as the standard required. Such, in my opinion, is the standard required by the statute. If a judge is satisfied beyond reason-able doubt as to the commission of the matrimonial offence relied upon by a petitioner as ground for divorce, he must surely be \"satisfied\" within the meaning of the enactment, and no less so in cases of adultery where the circumstances are such as to involve the paternity of a child.\nWhile the subject Lord MacDermott was considering was the nature of the proof required in proceedings involv\u00ading legitimacy, the latter part of the passage quoted goes .. beyond such an issue and that he intended to do so appears from what follows. The succeeding paragraph reads\n(p. 138) :\u2011\nOn the other hand, I am unable to subscribe to the view which, though not propounded here, has had its adherents, namely, that on its true construction the word \"satisfied\" is capable of connoting something less than proof beyond reasonable doubt. The jurisdiction in divorce involves the status of the parties and the public interest requires that the marriage bond shall not be set aside lightly or without strict inquiry. The terms of the statute recognize this plainly, and I think it would be quite out of keeping with the anxious nature of its provisions to hold that the court might be \"satisfied,\" in respect of a ground for dissolution, with something less than proof beyond reasonable doubt. I should, perhaps, add that I do not base my conclusions as to the appropriate standard of proof on any analogy drawn from the criminal law. I do not think it is possible to say, at any rate since the decision of this House in Mordaunt v. Moncreiffe[47], that the two jurisdictions are other than distinct. The true reason, as it seems to me, why both accept the same general standard-proof beyond reasonable doubt-lies not in any analogy, but in the gravity and public importance of the issues with which each is concerned.\nThe decisive point is the meaning to be assigned to the language of section 15 and 16 of the Act as it appears in c.. 97, R.S.B.C. 1948. The law as thus declared has not been modified or altered by any legislation of the nature referred to in section 2 of the English Law Act. Proceedings under the Act are civil and not criminal in their nature. By the Evidence Act (c. 113, R.S.B.C. 1948), the Legislature has dealt generally with the matter of evidence in all proceedings respecting which it has jurisdiction. Section 8 provides that no plaintiff in any action for breach of promise of marriage shall recover a verdict, unless his or her testimony is corroborated by some other material evidence in support of such promise : section 11 provides that in claims against the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of a deceased person, the plaintiff shall not obtain a verdict on his own evidence in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence. Subsection 2 of section 8 provides that, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, a husband or wife may in any proceeding in any court give evidence that he or she did not have sexual intercourse with the other party to the marriage at any time or within any period of time before or during the marriage. Sections 27 to 50 prescribe the manner in which various matters may be proven. The Act contains nothing to differentiate the nature of the proof required or permitted in divorce as distinguished from other civil proceedings. Divorce rules regulating the procedure in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in divorce proceedings have been adopted and the matter with which we are concerned is not dealt with.\nIn Mordaunt v. Moncreiffe [48], where proceedings for divorce were taken under the Act of 1857, Lord Chelmsford said in part (p. 384) :\u2011\nIn confining our attention strictly and exclusively to the Act, it becomes. unnecessary to consider (as some of the learned judges have done) whether proceedings for a divorce are of a civil, or criminal, or quasi-criminal nature. No aid to its construction can be obtained by determining the exact character of the proceedings; nor from analogies derived from considerations applicable to cases of these different des\u00adcriptions respectively. It is only necessary to bear in mind that the Act gives a right not previously existing to obtain the dissolution of marriage for adultery, by the decree of a newly-created Court of Law, and from its provisions alone we must learn the conditions upon which the jurisdiction is to be exercised.\nSince, however, some of the decisions in England, above mentioned, refer to cases decided prior to 1857 as an aid to the interpretation of the Act, it may be helpful to determine the principle upon which the ecclesiastical courts proceeded in granting decrees \u00e0 mens\u00e2 et thoro. In Rix v. Rix [49], where a decree was sought by reason of the wife's adultery, Sir George Hay said that if the fact was proved either directly, or presumptively (which was the general case), the court was bound to grant its sentence and said (p. 74):\u2011\nOcular proof is seldom expected; but the proof should be strict, satisfactory and conclusive.\nIn Williams v. Williams [50], Sir William Scott, after-wards Lord Stowell, said (pp. 299, 300) :-\u2011\nIt is undoubtedly true, that direct evidence of the fact is not required, as it would render the relief of the husband almost impracticable; but I take the rule to be that there must be such proximate circumstances proved, as by former decisions, or on their own nature and tendency, satisfy the legal conviction of the Court, that the criminal act has been committed. and that the Court (p. 303) :\u2011\nmust recollect that more is necessary, and * * * * must be convinced, in its legal judgment, that the woman has transgressed not only the bounds of delicacy, but also of duty.\nIn Loveden v. Loveden [51], referred to in the judgment of Tucker L.J. on the appeal in Ginesi's case and by Lord MacDermott in the case of Preston-Jones, Sir William Scott employed the language so constantly referred to on the subject (pp. 2, 3) :\u2011\nIt is a fundamental rule, that it is not necessary to prove the direct fact of adultery; because, if it were otherwise, there is not one case in a hundred in which that proof would be attainable: it is very rarely indeed that the parties are surprised in the direct fact of adultery. In every case almost the fact is inferred from circumstances that lead to it by fair inference as a necessary conclusion; and unless this were the case, and unless this were so held, no protection whatever could be given to marital rights. What are the circumstances which lead to such a con\u00adclusion cannot be laid down universally, though many of them, of a more obvious nature and of more frequent occurrence, are to be found in the ancient books: at the same time it is impossible to indicate them univer\u00adsally; because they may be infinitely diversified by the situation and character of the parties, by the state of general manners, and by many other incidental circumstances apparently slight and delicate in them-selves, but which may have most important bearings in decisions upon the particular case. The only general rule that can be laid down upon the subject is, that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion; for it is not to lead a rash and intemperate judgment, moving upon appear\u00adances that are equally capable of two interpretations-neither is it to be a matter of artificial reasoning, judging upon such things differently from what would strike the careful and cautious consideration of a discreet man.\nIn Turton v. Turton[52], where the wife sought a separa\u00adtion on the ground of the husband's adultery and there were pleas of condonation and it was argued further that there had been connivance, Doctor Lushington (p. 351) said that as connivance necessarily involves criminality on the part of the individual who connives and as the blame sought to be imputed is the more serious, so ought the evidence in support of such a charge to be \"the more grave and conclusive.\" In Grant v. Grant[53], in the Court of Arches, Sir H. Jenner said (p. 57) :\u2011\nThe principle applicable to cases of this description, where there is no direct and positive evidence of an act of adultery, at any particular time or place, is laid down in a variety of cases, to which it is not necessary for the Court to advert. It is not necessary to prove an act of adultery at any one particular time or place; but the Court must look at all the circumstances together, and form its own opinion whether they lead to a fair and natural conclusion that an act of adultery has taken place between the parties at some time or other.\nA note to the report of this case in 163 E.R. at p. 340 says that the judgment was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on February 24, 1840, but I have been unable to find any other report of this.\nIn Shelford's work on the Law of Marriage and Divorce published in 1841, after referring to the fact that adultery can hardly be proved by any direct means, the learned author adopts the language employed by Lord Stowell in Williams v. Williams (supra) and Loveden v. Loveden (supra) as stating the general rule applicable as to proof of the fact. In Ernst on Marriage and Divorce published in 1879, the language of Lord Stowell in Loveden's case as to the general rule is adopted as stating the law that was applied in the ecclesiastical courts.\nLord Merriman did not refer to any authority in Church-man's case in support of the proposition that the same strict proof is required in the case of a matrimonial offence as is required in prosecutions for criminal offences. The reason for his conclusion, however, appears from what he subsequently said in Fairman's case[54]. It does not appear from the reports that his attention was drawn to what had been said on this subject in the House of Lords in Mordaunt v. Moncreiffe above referred to, or by Sir James Hannen in Branford v. Branford [55], or by Lord Lindley in Redfern v. Redfern [56]. In Mordaunt v. Moncreiffe, the action was for a divorce under the provisions of the Act of 1857. Owing to the insanity of the wife, the respondent in the action, the court, on insanity being found, appointed a guardian ad litem and suspended the proceedings; the husband appealed to the House of Lords insisting that her insanity ought not to bar the investigation of the charge of adultery brought against her. The House of Lords took the opinion of five of the judges: of these, Keating, J. was of the opinion that the proceedings in the Divorce Court were criminal in their nature and, therefore, could not be proceeded with: Lord Chief Baron Kelly, however, with whom Denman, J. and Pollock, B. agreed said in dealing with the contention that the suit was analogous to a criminal proceeding, (p. 381) :\u2011\nI am not aware of any species of suit or action known to the law, of which the incidents are to be determined by its analogy to criminal or civil proceedings. This proceeding is either a criminal prosecution or a civil suit. If a criminal prosecution, it can neither be instituted nor carried on while the accused is lunatic. If it be a civil suit, lunacy is no bar.\nand, after considering the same sections of the statute as those with which we are concerned in the present matter, expressed the view that the court was obligated, if satisfied that adultery had been committed, to grant the decree. Lord Chelmsford, having said, as above noted, that the rights of the parties must be determined by interpreting the statute, said that, while great stress has been laid on the argument upon the judgments of Sir Cresswell Cress-well in the case of Bawden v. Bawden [57], and of Lord Penzance in Mordaunt's case and on the fact that these learned judges were particularly conversant with the pro\u00adcedure of the Divorce Court, since the question was simply one of statutory construction this gave them no peculiar advantage. Lord Hatherley, who agreed with Lord Chemsford that the appeal must be allowed, dealt with the argument that the suit was in the nature of a criminal proceeding and said in part (p. 393) :\u2011\nMuch has been said, both in the Court below and before your Lord-ships, as to the analogy of the suit for a divorce to a criminal proceeding, and it has been inferred, that inasmuch as every step in the proceedings against a criminal is arrested by his or her becoming lunatic, so by parity of reasoning lunacy should bar all procedure against a Respondent in a divorce case. But the procedure in divorce is not a criminal procedure. It is true that the consequences of a divorce may be far more severe than those in any merely civil suit, but it is consequentially only that this result takes place. The divorce bills in Parliament were not bills of pains and penalties. They proceeded on the ground of relieving the petitioner for the bill from his unhappy position, that of indissoluble union with one who had herself, as far as was in her power, broken the marriage tie. The remedy applied was simply dissolution of the tie. No ordinary Divorce Act punished the adulterous party personally, or inflicted any pecuniary penalty. They usually, indeed, debarred the woman of dower and thirds, but that consequentially, because she ceased to be the wife; and, on the same grounds, they usually required the husband to give up his marital rights in the wife's property. The new Court was instituted to administer the same relief in the same manner. In Branford v. Branford, Sir James Hannen referred to the judgment in Mordaunt v. Moncrieffe e, saying in part\n(p. 73) :\u2011\nI think the point taken by the Queen's proctor is concluded by the decision in the House of Lords that proceedings of this kind are not criminal, and if not criminal then they must be civil, for there cannot be quasi-civil or quasi-criminal cases.\nIn Redfern v. Red f ern, Lindley L.J., after referring to the decision in the House of Lords, said that (p. 145) :\u2011\nThe cases there cited shew clearly that no indictment lies at common law for adultery: see 2 Salk., p. 552; neither is there any statute making it punishable.\nIn Fairman's case Lord Merriman's expression is that adultery is a \"quasi-criminal\" offence. It is true that in many of the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts reference is made to the \"crime\" of adultery, this, I must assume to be, due to the fact that adultery was an ecclesiastical offence but, as pointed out by Lindley L.J., it was not an offence at common law and it was not a criminal offence in England and is not in the Province of British Columbia. The principle stated by Lord Merriman and adopted by the Court of Appeal in Ginesi's case, while accepted as correctly stating the law in British Columbia and in Manitoba in the case of Battersby v. Battersby [58], was rejected by the Court of Appeal of Ontario in George v. George[59]. In that case Roach, J. pointed out that in Gower v. Gower [60], Denning L.J. said that he did not think that the Court of Appeal was irrevocably committed to the view that a charge of adultery must be regarded as a criminal charge to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, and indicated his own doubts that Ginesi v. Ginesi had been correctly decided, pointing out that the question had not been fully argued since counsel had conceded that the standard of proof of adultery was the same as in a criminal case and, further, that the decision in Mordaunt v. Moncriefe had not been cited. In Briginshaw v. Briginshaw [61], the High Court of Australia in a proceeding for the dissolution of marriage where the statute giving jurisdiction required the Court \"to satisfy itself, so far as it reasonably can, as to the facts alleged\" and to pronounce a decree nisi\nif \"it is satisfied that the case of the petitioner is estab\u00adlished,\" held that the standard of proof was not that of proof beyond reasonable doubt which obtains in respect of issues to be proved by the prosecution in criminal pro\u00adceedings. The matter was again dealt with by that Court in Wright v. Wright [62], where the Court considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ginesi v. Ginesi and declined to follow it, preferring their own decision in Briginshaw's case.\nIf the statement of Lord Merriman adopted by the Court of Appeal was intended as a statement of the law of England, as it was at the time the Divorce and Matri\u00admonial Causes Act of 1857 was enacted, in my opinion, it is not supported by authority. If it was intended as the proper construction to be placed upon the requirement of the statute that the court shall \"be satisfied on the evidence that the case of the petitioner has been proved,\" I think it is inaccurate and should not be followed. In Doe D. Devine v. Wilson [63], Sir John Patteson, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in an appeal from New South Wales, where in civil proceedings the genuine\u00adness of a deed was question, said that while it had been the practice to direct the jury in criminal cases that if they have a reasonable doubt the accused is to have the benefit of that doubt, whether on motives of public policy or from tenderness to life and liberty, or from any other reason, but that none of these reasons apply to a civil case.\nThe question we are to determine in the present matter is restricted to the standard of proof required in divorce proceedings in British Columbia, where the issue is as to whether adultery has been committed. No question affecting the legitimacy of offspring arises. The nature of the proof required is, in my opinion, the same as it is in other civil actions. If the court is not \"satisfied\" in any civil action of the plaintiff's right to recover, the action should fail. The rule as stated in Cooper v. Slade is, in my opinion, applicable.\nI would allow this appeal, set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of Wilson, J. except to the extent that they award costs to the respondent and direct that there be a new trial. The appellant should have his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal as against the co-respondent. There should be no costs as between the petitioner and the respondent of the proceedings in this Court. The costs of the first trial as between the petitioner and the co-respondent and the costs of all parties of the new trial to be in the discretion of the trial judge before whom the same is heard.\nRAND J.:-I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of my brother Locke that in an action for divorce on the ground of adultery the standard of proof is that required in a civil proceeding and I have only one observation to add. There is not, in civil cases, as in criminal prosecu\u00adtions, a precise formula of such a standard; proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", itself, in fact, an admonition and a warning of the serious nature of the proceeding which society is undertaking, has no prescribed civil counterpart; and we are not called upon to attempt any such formu\u00adlation. But I should say that the analysis of persuasion made by Dixon J. in the High Court of Australia, in part quoted by my brother Cartwright, is of value to judges as illuminating what is implicit in the workings of the mind in reaching findings of fact. No formula of direction is here involved; instructions to juries are left exactly where they were; but it is at all times desirable to have these elusive processes progressively made more explicit.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:-I agree with the conclusion of my brother Locke that in divorce proceedings in British Columbia the standard of proof in determining the issue whether adultery has been committed is the standard required in civil actions only.\nIt is usual to say that civil cases may be proved by a preponderance of evidence or that a finding in such cases may be made upon the basis of a preponderance of proba\u00adbility and I do not propose to attempt a more precise statement of the rule. I wish, however, to emphasize that in every civil action before the tribunal can safely find the affirmative of an issue of fact required to be proved it must be reasonably satisfied, and that whether or not it will be so satisfied must depend upon the totality of the circum\u00adstances on which its judgment is formed including the gravity of the consequences of the finding.\nI would like to adopt the following passage from the judgment of Dixon J. in Briginshaw v. Briginshaw [64] :-\u2011\nThe truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found' as a result of a mere mechani\u00adcal comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. No doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty; and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. Fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established inde\u00adpendently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters \"reasonable satisfaction\" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testi\u00admony, or indirect inferences. Everyone must feel that, when, for instance, the issue is on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory conclusion may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any sound and prudent judgment if the question was whether some act had been done involving grave moral delinquency.\nand the following from the judgment of Roach J.A. in George v. George and Logie [65]) :\u2011\nThe judicial mind must be \"satisfied\" that the alleged act of adultery was in fact committed, but it need not be satisfied to the extent of a moral certainty as in a criminal case. Evidence that creates only suspicion, surmise or conjecture is, of course, insufficient. It is necessary that the quality and quantity of the evidence must be such as leads the tribunal-be it judge or jury-acting with care and caution, to the fair and reasonable conclusion that the act was committed.\nThere is, I think, no difference between the law of British Columbia and that of Ontario in this matter.\nIn my opinion the tribunal of fact deciding an issue of adultery in a proceeding for divorce should be instructed in the sense of the above quoted passages, not because the standard of proof required differs from that in other civil actions but because the consideration entering into the formation of judgment which Dixon J. describes by the words \"the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding\" assumes great importance in such a case.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the Petitioner: Shulman, Fouks & Tupper.\nSolicitor for the Co-Respondent: A.

Since this is an ameliorating rule, in weighing the considerations too delicate weights should not be used.\nKydd v. The Watch Committee of Liverpool, 24 T.L.R. 257 referred to.\nMOTION by the applicant before Mr. Justice Rand in Chambers for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.\nJ. M. Coyne for the motion.\nG. Perley Robertson contra.\nRand J.:\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Rule 142 requires the application to be accompanied by an affidavit that the applicant is not worth $500 \"in the world\" excepting his wearing apparel and his interest in the subject matter of the intended appeal. The applicant here was examined on her affidavit to that effect.\nFrom the examination it appears that she is a widow with a son ten years old. She is in receipt of a war pension for herself of $100 a month, and for the boy of $40 a month until he reaches 16 years of age. There are a few pieces of furniture, but nothing of any value. Living in Winnipeg, she rents four rooms at $30 a month. In February she was able to borrow $200 for clothes and to pay debts which she is now repaying in monthly instalments of $16. She owes about $200 in addition to that.\nOn these facts the question is whether she has shown that she is not worth $500. In determining that question, the matter should, I think, be approached, not as an inquiry whether the person has actually $500 worth of property, but whether, in the ordinary business judgment, it can be said that he is good for $500. That was the view taken by Buckley L.J. in Kydd v. The Watch Committee of Liverpool 1.\nCan this applicant, then, be said to be \"good\" for $500? In answering that question, it cannot be overlooked that this is an ameliorating rule, and in weighing the considerations too delicate weights should not be used. In the best view I can give the matter, I think she has shown that she is not worth the amount fixed. Leave is therefore given.\nThe appeal will be allowed by serving notice of appeal within fifteen days from the taking out of this order.\nLeave granted.\n1 24 T.L.R. 257.\n",

The right direction in such cases appears at page 334 in Mac Askill v. The King ([1931] S.C.R. 330).\nThe charge, in the present case, which included the use of that word would be improper if it were not for the clear directions from the trial judge that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to his capacity to form the necessary intent.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions v. Beard [1920] A.C. 479; Mac Askill v. The King [1931] S.C.R. 330; The King v. Hughes [1942] S.C.R. 517 and Latour v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 19 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murder.\nJ. L. Crawford for the appellant. The defence of gross intoxication was not fairly presented to the jury and the evidence of drunkenness was unduly minimized. The decisions show that the trial judge must present the defence of the accused adequately and fairly to the jury, together with the evidence in support thereof. His presentation must insure the jury's appreciating (a) the nature and value of the evidence bearing upon the defence and (6) the full significance of the evidence as related to the essential questions of fact upon which guilt depends. Above all, the evidence in support of a defence must be presented to the jury as carefully as the case for the prosecution.\nThe trial judge neglected to tell the jury the limited purpose and use of evidence of character and criminal record which may have prejudiced the appellant. He should have instructed the jury that this evidence could only go towards the credibility of his testimony in the witness stand and was not proof of the charge against him. The trial judge misdirected the jury on the defence of drunkenness as affecting the capacity of the appellant to form the necessary intention to constitute murder. The jury should have been instructed that in order to find the accused guilty of murder they must (a) be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the necessary capacity to be able to intend to commit murder; (b) that the crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time the accused fired the gun, he intended to kill the deceased, or that he intended to inflict bodily injury which was known to the accused at the time he fired the shot to be likely to cause death and that the accused was reckless as to whether or not death ensued. MacAskill v. The King 2.\nThe trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the accused was presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act when in fact the presumption had been rebutted and no longer had any probative value against positive evidence of intoxication.\nThe trial judge erred in instructing the jury that a proved incapacity on the part of the accused to form the necessary intention was necessary in order that the jury would be able to find the accused guilty of manslaughter.\nThe trial judge erred in instructing the jury to the effect that an amnesic condition of the accused was necessary to find the appellant guilty of manslaughter.\nW. J. Johnston for the respondent. The defence of gross intoxication was fairly presented and the evidence of drunkenness was not minimized. The trial judge dealt at length with that defence.\nThe reference to \"a proved incapacity of forming the specific intent\" was taken from the Beard's case 3, and it is quoted, adopted and followed by this Court in the MacAskill case (supra) and in Latour v. The King 4. The statement, itself, places no onus on the defence of proving incapacity and even if it could be said, that standing alone, without explanation, it might conceivably be so construed, the jury in the present case could not possibly have been under any such misapprehension. The trial judge made the statement only once in the whole course of his very long charge and followed it immediately by pointing out that \"if on any point whatever, you have a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused\".\nIn his charge the trial judge referred to the question of amnesia on three occasions but he did so only in so far as it was necessary in order to place before the jury a clear picture of the defence put forward by the appellant in his evidence. This question of amnesia was raised by the accused's evidence as part of his defence.\nAs to the ground of dissent stating that the intention to shoot does not necessarily import capacity to commit murder and to so instruct the jury was misdirection, it is submitted that the jury could not but appreciate and understand that the question for their consideration was: Did the accused have the capacity to form an intent to kill or the capacity to form an intent to do grievous bodily injury together with the capacity to know that death would be likely to ensue therefrom.\nThe jury were instructed in clear and unequivocal terms that they were not trying the accused on his relationship with the Kafkas but solely on the charge of murder and that in considering the truthfulness of the accused's evidence they could have regard for the evasiveness of his answers with respect to the Kafkas situation. It is true that the trial judge did not, in express words, instruct the jury that the accused's record could not be considered by them for any other purpose than in judging his truthfulness, but having dealt with it solely on the issue of credibility and in view of the comparative insignificant nature of the conviction, the omission to do so was not such an error as would mislead the jury.\nOn the evidence presented at the trial any reasonable jury would be entitled to find that the accused fired the gun and that prior to the shooting he had consumed a considerable quantity of liquor. The only question of substance that remained for consideration was the effect of the alleged intoxication of the accused on his capacity to form the intent necessary to the crime of murder, and there was ample evidence from which any jury could find that there was no reasonable doubt as to the accused's capacity to have that intent. The instruction that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act was normal and proper. The appellant, however, contends that it should not have been given in view of the evidence of intoxication which might have negatived the accused's capacity to have the intent therein referred to. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the trial judge effectively guarded against any such error by immediately instructing the jury that the presumption would cease to apply in the event that there was any reasonable doubt as to the accused's capacity or, to put it another way, that the presumption applied only if they first found capacity in the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.\nWhile there may have been some minor defects in the charge, none of them were of such a nature as could be regarded as having worked undue hardship or prejudice upon the accused. The verdict was reasonable and no miscarriage of justice occurred. Schmidt v. The King 5.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellant's conviction of having murdered Detective Sergeant Sims in Winnipeg was set aside by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba on the ground of misdirection and non-direction but, on the new trial ordered by that Court, he was again convicted. An appeal from that conviction to the Court of Appeal 6 was dismissed, Adamson J.A. dissenting, and, upon the six grounds of dissent taken by the latter, the appellant now asks this Court to set aside the conviction for murder and substitute one for manslaughter.\nSims died as a result of a shot fired by the appellant from the latter's own shot-gun. This was not denied and the main defence was that of drunkenness. The sixth ground of dissent is:\u2014\n6. In view of the cogent evidence of drinking and intoxication, no reasonable jury properly instructed could find that there was not a reasonable doubt as to the mental capacity of the accused to have the intent necessary to the crime of murder.\nIn view of the result at which we have arrived, we are not concerned with this ground if it means merely that the dissenting judge would not only have set aside the con- viction but would have directed a verdict of manslaughter to be entered. If, however, it means that there was nothing to go to the jury upon which they could find the appellant guilty of murder, we are satisfied that there was such evidence. It need not be detailed as it appears sufficiently in the reasons for judgment of Coyne J.A.\nThe other five grounds of dissent are:\u2014\n1. The defence of gross intoxication was not fairly presented and the evidence of drunkenness was unduly minimized.\n2. It was misdirection to require a \"proved incapacity of forming the specific intent\". This cast an improper onus on the accused.\n3. The suggestion that something approaching amnesia was necessary to reduce the offence to manslaughter was misdirection.\n4. Intention to shoot does not necessarily import capacity to commit murder and to so instruct the jury was misdirection.\n5. The neglect to tell the jury the limited purpose and use of evidence of character and criminal record may have been prejudicial.\nIn connection with the first four, it will be recalled that this was a second trial granted because of certain objections to the charge to the jury on the first trial. The matters to be considered were, therefore, present to the minds of all concerned and not least to the learned Chief Justice of the King's Bench presiding at the new trial. In his charge he not only dealt with the defences put forward on behalf of the accused but also with others that he considered might possibly be open on the evidence. That, indeed, as has been pointed out on many occasions, was his duty. Throughout his charge he made it plain to the jury many times that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt they might have as to whether the Crown had proved all the elements necessary to constitute the crime of murder. In addition to this, at the request of counsel for the accused, he recalled the jury and practically his last words to them were: \"If in your considerations you come to any point whatever where you have a reasonable doubt on that point, it must be resolved in favour of the accused.\"\nAs to dissent No. 1, in dealing with the evidence of drunkenness, the trial judge drew to the jury's attention everything that counsel was able to point out to us had been said in evidence, with the one exception that while the trial judge mentioned the evidence of Dr. Burland at the time of the admission of the accused to the hospital, he did not refer specifically to what Dr. Burland said as to the accused's condition about five hours later. With this exception, everything relied upon by the accused in order to show his drunkenness at the time of the occurrence was specifically mentioned by the trial judge. The real complaint of the accused seems to be that the trial judge did not endorse all that had been said upon the question of drunkenness but we have no doubt that the defence was fairly presented and that the evidence of drunkenness was not minimized.\nDissent No. 2 refers to the passage in the charge where the trial judge stated to the jury:\u2014\nEvidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity of forming the specific intent necessary to constitute the crime and merely establishing that the accused's mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.\nThis is taken from the third proposition formulated by Lord Birkenhead in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard 7. The specific objection is to the word \"proved\". Beard's Case is referred to in MacAskill v. The King 8, The King v. Hughes 9 and Latour v. The King 10. While it is quite true that section 260(d) of the Criminal Code was added in 1947 as a result of the decision in the Hughes case, the point upon which reference is now made to that decision is of importance in considering the present appeal. It was there pointed out that in Beard's Case it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused overpowered the child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death. There was no question that the act which caused the suffocation, the act of the prisoner in placing his hand on the mouth of the victim, was his voluntary act. In the MacAskill case it was pointed out at page 334 that the right direction in cases involving subsection (b) of section 259 of the Code is that evidence of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of the state of mind defined by that subsection may be taken into account with the other facts of the case for the purpose of determining whether or not in fact the accused had the intent necessary to bring the case within that subsection; but that the existence of drunkenness not involving such incapacity is not a defence. In such cases that has the effect of altering the words \"a proved\" in proposition 3 in Beard's case to \"an existing\" or some similar expression. In fact, Lord Birkenhead in proposition No. 3 was not dealing with the question of burden of proof. Notwithstanding that it was used in the present case, there is no doubt the learned Chief Justice was not directing the jury on a question of onus and that that is so is made abundantly clear by those parts of his charge that precede and follow the extract given above. It is not a question of there being a defect in the charge but of the charge as a whole being proper and being delivered in such a form that the jury could not possibly misunderstand that the onus throughout remained upon the Crown. Lord Birkenhead's third proposition is also set out in the Latour case at page 29 but at that point the question of onus was not being specifically dealt with. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, we think it proper to state unequivocally that a trial judge should not use the word \"proved\" in his charge in any case where drunkenness is set up as a defence to a charge of murder. Such a charge would be improper in the absence of clear directions, such as exist in the present case, that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to the capacity of the accused to form the necessary intent.\nAs to dissent No. 3, Adamson J.A. suggested that the charge indicated that something approaching paralysis of the mind was required before the absence of capacity to form the necessary intention can be found. We must say that we are unable to discover any such indication.\nDissent No. 4 is that at two stages of his charge the trial judge directed the jury that capacity to intend to shoot was sufficient to constitute an intention to commit murder. The first quotation made by the dissenting judge is as follows:\u2014\nGentlemen, it is on that evidence that you have to come to the conclusion as to whether the accused at the time he fired that gun at Sims was capable of forming an intent to shoot the man who was in front of him. Remember that it didn't have to be Sims. He didn't have to know Sims. The question is, Was he capable of forming an intent to shoot the human being in front of him when he fired that shot? There is no question of motive in this case. Was he capable of forming an intent to shoot Sims, not Sims as Sims, not Sims as Detective Sims, but Sims as the human being that was standing before him in that room at the time he fired? If you come to the conclusion that he wasn't, then he is guilty of manslaughter.\nHowever, this must be read in connection with what immediately follows:\u2014\nIf you come to the conclusion that he was capable of forming that intent, that he intended to shoot that human being in front of him, then he is guilty of murder, subject to provocation or self-defence, and I will deal with those very briefly afterwards. If, on the other hand, you have to go further: If you find that he had an intent but if you decide that being capable of forming an intent his intent wasn't to kill the man, you must ask yourselves, Being capable of forming an intent, was his intent to do grievous bodily harm to that man, knowing and being capable of knowing that what he did was likely to result in death and being reckless as to whether death ensued or not?\nThe second quotation reads\u2014\nWhat you have to decide on this question of drunkenness is, Was the accused in such a state of drunkenness that he was unable to form an intent to shoot that gun that night, that is, to commit the crime with which he is charged? But if in your consideration of that question you have any reasonable doubt, that is, for instance, if in considering the evidence of the accused you feel that it might be true, that you have the impression in your minds that it might be true, then that would raise a reasonable doubt in your minds. Always, the benefit of the reasonable doubt must be given to the accused.\nAgain, there must be added to that what immediately follows:\u2014\nBut if you come to the conclusion, after studying all the evidence, that there was a capacity to form the intention to fire that shot at that human being, then you ask yourselves, first of all, When he fired it did he intend to kill? If he did, the matter stops there. But if when he fired it he didn't intend to kill but intended only to do grievous bodily harm, then did he also have the capacity to know that death would be likely to ensue from that grievous bodily harm and was reckless.\nUpon reading the whole of the charge, and particularly what followed each of the quotations appearing in the dissenting judgment, it is made abundantly clear that the trial judge was not giving any such direction as was suggested.\nThe only remaining ground of dissent is No. 5. The jury were instructed that they were not trying the appellant on his relationship with the Kafkas but only on the charge of murder, and that in considering the truthfulness of the appellant's evidence, they could have regard to the evasiveness of his admissions with respect to the Kafkas situation. The trial judge made but one reference to a previous conviction of the appellant of firing a gun in the City of Winnipeg, and then only in connection with the latter's credibility. The evidence of the appellant's character and of the previous conviction was thus referred to only on the question of credibility.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Munson & Crawford.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Hon.

The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 344\nDate: 1952-06-30\nGordon E. Thomas (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1952: June 4, 30.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Corroboration\u2014Rape\u2014Complaint\u2014Evidence.\nThe appellant, charged with rape, admitted that he had had intercourse with the complainant, but swore that it had been with her consent, which she denied saying that she had only submitted to it in fear of bodily harm. His conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nHeld: There should be a new trial; since the jury had not been properly instructed on the question of corroboration and as to the limited use that may be made of the evidence of complaint, it was impossible to say that if it had been properly instructed it would necessarily have convicted the appellant.\nHeld: The corroboration to be sought was of the complainant\u2019s testimony that she did not consent but only submitted in fear of bodily harm. In a case of this sort, when there is any evidence on which a jury could find corroboration, the jury should be directed as to what is necessary to constitute corroboration and it is then for the jury to say whether corroborative inferences should be drawn. It was not, in the present case, made plain to the jury (i) that corroboration could be found only in evidence independent of the testimony of the complainant and of such a character that it tended to show that her story on the vital question of consent was true, and (ii) that facts, though independently established, could not amount to corroboration if, in the view of the jury, they were equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of her story on this point.\nHeld: It was not made clear to the jury that in a case where a sexual offence is charged, evidence of the making of a complaint is not corroborative of the testimony of the complainant. Where corroboration is required either by statute or under the rule of practice at common law, the corroborative evidence must be shown to possess the essential quality of independence. It must be made plain to the jury that the witness whose testimony requires corroboration can not corroborate herself. (Rex v. Auger 64 O.L.R. 181 and Rex v. Calhoun [1949] O.R. 180 ought not to be followed on that point).\nHeld: There was failure to instruct the jury of the limited use that may be made of the evidence of the complaint and to warn them against treating the complaint as evidence of the facts complained of.\nThe King v. Baskerville [1916] 2 K.B. 658; The Queen v. Lillyman (1896) 2 Q.B. 167; Rex v. Evans 18 C.A.R. 123; Rex v. Coulthread 24 C.A.R. and Rex v. Whitehead [1929] 1 K.B. 99 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] upholding the conviction of the appellant on a charge of rape. A.E. Maloney for the appellant. On the first question, it is a fatal error to fail to define corroboration to a jury in a case of this nature since there is a danger that the jury might well have regarded some item of evidence as being corroborative which is not capable of being such in law: Rex v. Zielinski[2], Rex v. Yott [3] and Rex v. Hong Suey[4].\nIn connection with some of the matters which the jury might have regarded as corroborative but which are not capable of being so in law, the following cases are referred to: Rex v. Hubin[5], Rex v. Yates[6], Rex v. Gemmill[7].\nIt is no answer to this contention to say that there is otherwise in the record ample evidence capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant, because the jury might well have failed to regard it as such and might not have seen fit to act upon it: Rex v. Ross[8], Rex v. Hubin (supra).\nOn the second question, it is submitted that due to the failure to define corroboration, it might well be that the jury may have regarded the complaint to the husband as being corroboration of her testimony. A complaint made in a sexual case is not capable in law of being corroboration, which term is defined in Rex v. Baskerville[9]. It is not corroboration because it lacks the essential quality of independence. It must serve to confirm not only that a crime has been committed but also the identity of the accused as the person who committed it. Independent means that it must emanate from some source other than the complainant or the witness whose testimony requires corroboration. Thus in a case of rape where the defence is consent, the offender\u2019s admission that he had carnal connection is sufficient corroboration of the complainant\u2019s testimony identifying the accused as the person with whom she had relations. However, it then becomes necessary to search the record for independent evidence to corroborate her testimony of non-consent. The following cases are referred to: Rex v. Evans[10], Rex v. Coulthread[11], Rex v. Whitehead[12], Rex v. Osborne[13], Reg. v. Lillyman[14] and Rex v. Lovell[15].\nBecause of the completely inadequate directions on the third question, it may well be that the jury wrongly thought that they could regard the complaint as evidence of the truth of the facts it contained: Reg. v. Lillyman (supra), Rex v. Osborne (supra) and Rex v. Hill[16].\nW.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent. The failure of the trial judge to define corroboration could have had no practical result. The term as understood by laymen is self-explanatory. Reference by the judge to all the circumstances in the evidence, which in law were corroboration of non-consent, had the same effect as if he had in fact defined the term. In the light of the evidence and the manner in which the evidence of non-consent was left to the jury, it cannot be said, that, had the term been exhaustively defined the jury could not have reached the same conclusion: Rex v. Coulthread11 and Rex v. Zielenski[17].\nIt is a well established principle of law that in cases involving a charge of rape, the evidence of complaint is not evidence of the facts complained of, nor as being a part of the res gestae, but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the complainant with the story told by her in the witness box, and that what was done, was done without her consent. It has been said that evidence of a complaint is corroboration of the credibility of the complainant and where consent is an issue it is corroborative of her evidence that she did not consent: Rex v. Osborne13. It must be noted that nowhere does the trial judge categorically instruct the jury that the evidence of complaint is to be treated by them as corroboration of her story, or even as to her non-consent; furthermore, no proper inference can be drawn from the charge that the complaint can be treated by the jury as corroboration of all the evidence of the complainant. If, however, it might be inferred that the judge had left it to the jury that the complaint could be treated as corroboration of her evidence and as to her non-consent, it was only in a limited sense that the term was so used.\nThe term \u201ccorroboration\u201d as defined in Rex v. Baskerville[18] has not necessarily the same implications when used in connection with the effect of the evidence of a complaint in cases of rape. In cases requiring corroboration by statute or common law, the term implies that not only was there evidence tending to prove that the crime was committed, but in addition, that it was committed by the accused or that the accused was a party to its commission. In the wide sense of the term, corroboration connotes an aspect or quality of independence, but where the term is used in relation that the complaint is in corroboration of the complainant\u2019s testimony, it simply means that the complaint not only shows a consistency of conduct, but it may confirm her evidence as to non-consent. The quality of independence, of course, cannot be established, and consequently it is in this limited sense that the evidence of complaint by its very nature confirms or corroborates the credibility of the complainant and her evidence as to non-consent.\nWhen the term in this sense is used it means that the complaint adds an additional quality to the character of the complainant\u2019s evidence, and consequently her evidence is more worthy of credit than if her testimony stood alone. In this sense the complaint is corroboration.\nIn The Queen v. Lillyman[19], it was put that the test is whether according to the principles of the exception, her having made the complaint tends to corroborate testimony given by the child at the trial.\nIn our Courts it has been held that it is not misdirection to the jury in a rape case to tell them that the complaint may be taken as evidence negativing consent and in corroboration of its absence: Rex v. Calhoun[20] and Rex v. Auger[21]. In Rex v. Coulthread[22], the term was used in its widest sense, and left the impression with the jury that the complaint was independent testimony that not only that the offence had been committed but that the accused had committed it. No such language is to be found in the case at bar.\nIt is conceded that the trial judge omitted to instruct the jury on the limited use that could be made of the complaint and that the complaint should not be regarded as proof of the facts it contained, but what he did say could not be interpreted that they were to take it as conclusive evidence that the offence had been commited by the accused or that there was non-consent. The language can only be interpreted as conveying that a complaint in proper circumstances gives \u201cgreater probability\u201d to her evidence or corroborates or confirms her credibility as to non-consent. However, on this ground, had the jury been properly instructed, they could have reached no other conclusion. Rex v. Coulthread (supra).\nFurthermore, on the facts as disclosed by the evidence, and on the charge taken as a whole, there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[23] dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant before Treleaven J. and a jury on a charge of rape.\nThe appeal is brought pursuant to an order of my brother Kellock granting leave to appeal on the following questions of law:\u2014\n1. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to find that the learned trial judge had erred in failing to define corroboration to the jury.\n2. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to find that the complaint made by the complainant in this case as in any sexual case is not capable as a matter of law of being corroborative of the complainant\u2019s testimony because it lacks the essential quality of independence.\n3. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to find that the learned trial judge had erred in failing to instruct the jury of the limited use that could be made of the evidence of the complaint made by complainant to her husband and particularly he erred in failing to instruct the jury that the complaint must not under any circumstances be regarded by them as proof of the truth of the facts it contained. The following summary of the evidence is taken with some modifications and additions from the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[24].\nThe appellant is unmarried and twenty-one years of age. The complainant is a married woman, thirty\u2011five years of age, living with her husband and three children in the city of Hamilton.\nIn the evening of Tuesday, October 24, 1950, the complainant, accompanied by a woman friend, attended a theatre in downtown Hamilton. After the show they went to a cocktail lounge, where they had something to eat and the complainant had two drinks of whiskey. After leaving the cocktail lounge about 12.45 o\u2019clock, the friend boarded a bus to go home and the complainant waited on the street corner for a bus that would take her to her home. The appellant, driving his father\u2019s car, came to the corner and, seeing the complainant, stopped and beckoned to her and suggested he would drive her home. The complainant at first demurred but shortly accepted the invitation and entered the car. The appellant drove her to the front of her home, where he stopped. According to the complainant, she sought to leave the car promptly but the appellant suggested there was no hurry, grabbed her by the wrist and set the car in motion. As the car rounded the nearby corner, she screamed, leaned over and blew the horn with her free hand, and then grabbed the steering wheel. In the scuffle, the car went up over a neighbour\u2019s lawn. The appellant straightened it out onto the highway and drove at a considerable speed along a course that finally led to a lonesome section on the Hamilton Mountain. During the journey, according to the complainant, she protested that she wanted to go home and she started to cry. The appellant told her to stop crying and sit still. The car was travelling at such a speed that she was afraid to jump out.\nThe complainant testified that when the appellant finally stopped the car, she said that she was going to get out and attempted to open the door. Thereupon the appellant grabbed her and pulled her toward him. According to her, she pulled his hair and bit his face, and he then swore at her and said \u201cI\u2019ll fix you\u201d, grabbed her by the throat with one hand and started to choke her. She pleaded with him, and finally he released his grasp upon her throat and made it plain that he intended to have sexual intercourse with her. By that time she was terrified and yielded in fear of further violence saying to him \u201cI guess I have no choice\u201d.\nWhen the act was completed the appellant drove her home, stopping the car at her request at a well\u2011lighted intersection two and a half blocks from her house. The complainant stated that when he stopped the car, or shortly before he stopped it, he turned out the lights but this the appellant denied. As she left the car, she attempted to get the number of the license but succeeded in getting only some of the digits in it.\nWhen the complainant entered her home her husband, although in bed, was still awake. The husband testified, that the complainant was sobbing, her hair was disarrayed, her dress was askew, there were two small scratches on her chest and her throat was very red from ear to ear. He asked her \u201cWhat is the trouble?\u201d to which she replied \u201cI have just got myself in a jam\u201d. He then said \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d to which she replied \u201cA young chap picked me up and brought me home and he then started up in his car quick and took me out in the outskirts of the city and I have been raped.\u201d\nThe appellant, in his evidence, admitted that the complainant had grabbed the steering wheel of the car as he was first leaving her home. He admitted that when they arrived at the lonely spot on the mountainside, he made it plain that he desired to have sexual intercourse with her. He testified that at first she faintly demurred and he possibly used some bad language toward her, but that she finally agreed and that the act took place with her full consent and co\u2011operation. He denied using either threats or violence.\nThere was some conflict of evidence as to what conversation occurred between the time when the complainant said \u201cI guess I have no choice\u201d and the completion of the act of intercourse. She admits having said to the appellant \u201cYou seem to have a lot of experience\u201d. He deposed that he had asked her whether he should use a contraceptive and that she said \u201cNo\u201d. The complainant was called in reply and asked whether any conversation such as that last mentioned took place. Her reply was \u201cNo, I don\u2019t recall any\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, October 25, according to the complainant\u2019s husband, instead of communicating with the police, he started out himself to try to locate the car, part of the license number and the description of which his wife had given him. He was unsuccessful.\nOn Thursday, October 26, the husband and wife were in downtown Hamilton together, shortly after the noon hour, and, by coincidence, the wife saw the appellant on the street and pointed him out to her husband. Together they approached the appellant. Some conversation took place between the husband and the appellant, during which the latter denied ever having seen the complainant. The appellant stated, among other things, that Police Constable Larson could account for his whereabouts on the Tuesday night, and the husband and wife and the appellant started for the police station. On the way, a police cruiser, in which were Police Constable Larson and another officer, drove along and stopped, and the husband entered into a discussion with them that resulted finally in the three of them getting into the cruiser with the police constables to go to a parking lot where the appellant said his father usually parked his car. In the parking lot, the complainant identified a car as being the one in which she had been driven and the appellant admitted it was the one he was driving on the night in question.\nThe appellant was then taken in custody to the police station. There, after a caution was administered to him, he made a statement in which he stated where he had been and what he had been doing from about 3.00 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of Tuesday, October 24, until he went to bed at his home shortly after midnight. This statement contained no reference to his meeting with the complainant or being in her company. It was reduced to writing and signed by the appellant.\nAfter about two hours further interrogation by the police, which further interrogation, according to the evidence of the police constables, was prompted by the fact that they did not believe what the appellant had said in his first statement, the appellant made another statement in which he did account for his meeting with the complainant on the street corner, their drive, first to the front of her home, and later to the lonely spot where he had sexual intercourse with her with her consent. Both these statements were admitted in evidence at the trial. I of course, express no opinion as to whether or not they would be admissible at a new trial as that question is not before us.\nIn August 1949 the complainant had undergone a hysterectomy. She had recovered her normal health but testified that she could not become pregnant.\nFrom the above recital it at once becomes obvious that the appellant had carnal knowledge of the complainant at the time and place alleged by the Crown and that the only substantial question before the jury was whether this was done either without her consent or with consent which had been extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm.\nThe only portion of the charge of the learned trial judge which is relevant to any of the three points before us is as follows:\u2014\nThere are two other principles of law applicable to a case of this kind which I must mention to you. One is that it is dangerous to convict in a case of this kind on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. Now, when I say it is dangerous, that is what I mean. If you are satisfied of the truth of the story of the complainant, and do not believe the story of the accused, you may, notwithstanding corroboration or lack of it, make your finding accordingly; but for a long time it has been considered dangerous to convict on uncorroborated evidence. Of course, I am not saying that in this case there is not corroboration, and I will mention what is brought forward here as corroboration in a moment when I come to deal with the evidence. There is corroboration as to the identity of the accused, because he admits the carnal knowledge; there is no difficulty there; but on the question of corroboration as to whether there was consent or not, there is evidence\u2014it is for you to say what weight you give to it, and if you believe it\u2014the redness of the neck, the scratches on the chest, the dishevelled condition of the clothes, the sobbing of the wife when she got home, the mark or marks on her wrist\u2014depending, of course, gentlemen, on what you believe about it, but there is evidence which if you believe it to be true I would think you might accept as corroboration of her story.\nOne other thing: It is the duty of a woman who has been sexually attacked, raped or attempted rape, to complain of the offence at the first reasonable opportunity. Unless it is the first reasonable opportunity, probably the evidence would not be admitted at all as a matter of law, but here, if you accept the evidence, the complainant as soon as she got home told her husband that she had been raped, and he saw the marks on her neck and chest and I think at that time her wrist. But there is the evidence which is before you for consideration as to whether she complained at the first reasonable opportunity or not. The weight to be attached to it, gentlemen, is for you.\nIt will be convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal in the order set out above.\nAs to the first point, it is a well settled rule of practice at common law that in cases of rape while the jury may convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the prosecutrix the judge must warn them that it is dangerous to do so and may in his discretion advise them not to do so. In the case at bar no exception is taken to the manner in which the learned trial judge warned the jury of this danger. What is complained of is his failure to explain to them what is meant by the term corroboration. In my opinion this ground is well taken. I do not think it necessary to refer to authorities other than the classic statement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Baskerville[25]:\nWe hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within that class of offences for which corroboration is required by statute. The language of the statute, \u201cimplicates the accused\u201d, compendiously incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice. The nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the accused.\nThe corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.\nThis decision has been repeatedly approved and acted upon by this Court. See, for example, Hubin v. The King[26], particularly at page 444 and MacDonald v. The King[27]. In the case at bar there was no question as to whether if a crime was committed it was committed by the appellant. The question was whether or not a crime had been committed at all. The corroboration to be sought was of the complainant\u2019s testimony that she did not consent to the act of intercourse but only submitted to it in fear of bodily harm.\nAs there is to be a new trial I do not think it desirable to discuss the evidence with a view to attempting to make a list of those items in which it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to find corroboration. The judge who presides at the new trial will be dealing with the evidence then given and in my opinion should do so unhampered by anything that has been said in the courts below with regard to any particular item of evidence given at the first trial. It is the duty of the judge in a case of this sort, when there is any evidence on which a jury could find corroboration, to direct the jury as to what is necessary to constitute corroboration and it is then for the jury to say whether corroborative inferences should be drawn. In the case at bar to enable the jury to deal with this question it was essential that it be made plain to them (i) that corroboration could be found only in evidence independent of the testimony of the complainant and of such a character that it tended to show that her story on the vital question of consent was true, and (ii) that facts, though independently established, could not amount to corroboration if, in the view of the jury, they were equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of her story on this point. These matters were not explained to the jury.\nI do not understand the reasons of Roach J.A. as differing from the view that the jury should have been so instructed. The learned Justice of Appeal was however of opinion that the omissions in the charge in this regard were overcome by what the learned trial judge said to the jury, in the passage from his charge quoted above, by way of illustration of what might in the case at bar amount to corroboration. With respect, I am unable to agree. I am not satisfied that the jury would understand, for example, that the evidence of the complaint must not be regarded as corroboration, and I find nothing in what was said which would bring home to them that evidence to be corroborative must possess the essential quality of independence.\nAs to the second point, while I do not understand the learned trial judge to have intended to charge the jury that they might treat the evidence of the complaint as corroborative of the complainant\u2019s testimony, I think it was not made clear to them that they must not so regard it. I am of opinion that in cases where a sexual offence is charged, evidence of the making of a complaint is not corroborative of the testimony of the complainant in the sense in which the term corroborative is used in the passage from The King v. Baskerville quoted above. The ground upon which evidence of the making of a complaint is admitted and the limited purpose for which such evidence can be legitimately used are clearly stated in The Queen v. Lillyman[28]. I refer particularly to the following passage at page 177:\u2014\n. . . The evidence is admissible only upon the ground that it was a complaint of that which is charged against the prisoner, and can be legitimately used only for the purpose of enabling the jury to judge for themselves whether the conduct of the woman was consistent with her testimony on oath given in the witness-box negativing her consent, and affirming that the acts complained of were against her will, and in accordance with the conduct they would expect in a truthful woman under the circumstances detailed by her. The jury, and they only, are the persons to be satisfied whether the woman\u2019s conduct was so consistent or not. Without proof of her condition, demeanour, and verbal expressions, all of which are of vital importance in the consideration of that question, how is it possible for them satisfactorily to determine it?\nIn his reasons Roach J.A. quotes the following passage from Rex v. Osborne[29]:\n. . . Within such bounds, we think the evidence should be put before the jury, the judge being careful to inform the jury that the statement is not evidence of the facts complained of, and must not be regarded by them, if believed, as other than corroborative of the complainant\u2019s credibility, and, when consent is in issue, of the absence of consent.\nThis passage is correctly explained by Hewart L.C.J. speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Lovell[30], as follows:\u2014\n. . . It is quite true, if one looks at particular passages in the judgment in Osborne, it might seem, as far as mere words are concerned, as if the judgment went beyond the judgment in Lillyman. (But that is probably not the correct view. When, for example, the words are used, as they are at page 561 of the report, \u201ccorroborative of the complainant\u2019s credibility\u201d, nothing more is really meant than what is spoken of in Lillyman in the words: \u201cThe consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box.\u201d\nIt is to be observed that in Rex v. Osborne (supra) the question whether the evidence of complaint was capable of being treated as corroboration of the complainant\u2019s testimony did not arise and was not decided. As appears at page 553 of the report the chairman had told the jury that the only corroboration of the girl\u2019s story was the statement of the prisoner at the police station.\nIf and in so far as the judgment of Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Auger[31], and particularly at page 184, decides that evidence of a complaint is corroborative of the complainant\u2019s testimony in the sense in which the word is used in The King v. Baskerville or that evidence which would not serve as corroboration in a case where corroboration is required by statute might do so in cases falling within the rule of practice at common law, it is at variance with the judgment in Baskerville and ought not to be followed.\nI venture to think that the difficulty in reconciling the statements in some of the decisions arises from the fact that, in common parlance, the word \u201ccorroborate\u201d has not a single or precise meaning. Since the decision in Baskerville, and its approval and adoption in this Court referred to above, it is no longer open to doubt that before evidence can be properly described as corroborative in cases where corroboration is required either by statute or under the rule of practice at common law it must be shewn to possess the essential quality of independence. It must be made plain to the jury that the witness whose testimony requires corroboration can not corroborate herself. I do not think it necessary to multiply authorities and will refer only to the following:\u2014In Rex v. Evans[32], Hewart L.C.J. speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal said:\u2014\nIt has been pointed out again and again in these cases that evidence of a complaint by the prosecutrix is not corroboration of her evidence against the prisoner. It entirely lacks the essential quality of coming from an independent quarter. In Rex v. Coulthread[33], Avory J., with the concurrence of Lord Hewart C.J. and Branson J., said at page 48:\u2014\n. . . Undoubtedly that statement that the things which were said in the morning might be treated as corroboration of the boy\u2019s story is in direct conflict with the view of this Court, expressed in more than one case, that a complaint of this sort, though it may be evidence of the consistency of the complainant\u2019s story is not corroboration in the proper sense in which that word is understood in cases of this kind.\nIn Rex v. Whitehead[34], Lord Hewart C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 102:\u2014\n. . . Any such inference as to what the girl had told her mother could not amount to corroboration of the girl\u2019s story, because it proceeded from the girl herself; it was merely the girl\u2019s story at second hand. In order that evidence may amount to corroboration it must be extraneous to the witness who is to be corroborated.\nRex v. Whitehead was accepted as correctly stating the law in this regard in the judgment of Bowlby J.A. in Rex v. LeBrun[35]. The other members of the Court of Appeal, Roach and Hogg, JJ.A., agreed with Bowlby J.A. If and in so far as the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Calhoun[36] expresses the view that evidence of a complaint may be treated as corroboration of the testimony of the complainant within the meaning of the term corroboration as explained in The King v. Baskerville it must be regarded as over-ruled. I do not mean by this to suggest that the actual result reached in that case was wrong.\nAs to the third point I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury as to the limited use that could be made of the evidence of the complaint. The importance of so doing and of warning the jury against treating the complaint as evidence of the facts complained of has been stressed in many cases. I will refer only to the following passage in Regina v. Lillyman (supra) at page 178:\u2014\nIt has been sometimes urged that to allow the particulars of the complaint would be calculated to prejudice the interests of the accused, and that the jury would be apt to treat the complaint as evidence of the facts complained of. Of course, if it were so left to the jury they would naturally so treat it. But it never could be legally so left; and we think it is the duty of the judge to impress upon the jury in every case that they are not entitled to make use of the complaint as any evidence whatever of those facts, or for any other purpose than that we have stated. In conclusion it is necessary to consider the. submission of counsel for the respondent that even if we should find that there was error in law as to any or all of the grounds of appeal argued before us we should apply the provisions of section 1014(2) of the Criminal Code and dismiss the appeal. After a perusal of the complete record I find myself quite unable to say that a reasonable jury after being properly directed would necessarily have convicted the appellant.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Edmonds & Moloney.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.B.

Co., for the summer of 1949 as a waitress at the company's hotel at St. Andrews, N.B. In common with other students similarly employed she was permitted the use of a private bathing beach owned by the hotel. When not on duty, she was free to leave the premises and go where she pleased. Following the serving of breakfast on June 23, 1949, she was told she would not be required until 5 p.m. While so excused she proceeded to the private bathing beach for a swim and in diving from a float struck bottom and suffered serious and permanent injuries.\nThe accident was reported to the Workmen's Compensation Board by the C.P.R. in October, 1949, and on June 22, 1950, it submitted a further report, together with an application for an adjudication, binding on all interested parties including N, that the accident was one covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act 1. The Board ruled that it was unable to consider the report submitted as being a claim made by N. and would take no action to deal with it as such. On Jan. 2, 1951, N. in a communication to the Board setting out that she was then of age, purported to adopt as a claim for compensation the application made by the C.P.R. except as to any differences there might be in the answers made in that application and the one now enclosed with her letter. N.'s application was disallowed whereupon the C.P.R., pursuant to s. 35 of the Act, appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, on the ground that the Board's decision involved the following questions of law:\n1. Whether the accident to said Marilyn Noell on June 23, 1949, arose out of and in the course of her employment within the scope of the said chapter.\n2. Whether an application for compensation was filed in time.\n3. Whether any person interested in the adjudication and determination of the question whether an accident has arisen out of and in the course of an employment within the scope of the said chapter, is entitled at any time to an adjudication and determination by the said Board.\nThe appeal was heard by Harrison, Hughes and Bridges, JJ. who answered the questions as follows:\nQuestion (1) Yes (Bridges J.\u2014No.)\nQuestion (2) Yes.\nQuestion (3) No answer.\nOn appeal to this Court:\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the questions answered as follows : Question (1) : No.\nQuestion (2) : No (Cartwright J. No answer.)\nQuestion (3) : Yes.\nDecision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 28 M.P.R. 270, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the New Brunswick Supreme Court, Appeal Division 2, allowing an appeal from certain decisions of the Workmen's Compensation Board.\nJ. J. F. Winslow Q.C. and E. N. McKelvey for the appellant. As to Q. 1, the judgment of the majority of the Appeal Division proceeds on a wrong principle: the Court failed to examine the question as to whether Miss Noell's employment had been interrupted before the accident. The question involves the application of s. 7 of the Act. Her work required her to serve in the hotel proper as a waitress at the regular meal hours. Although her employment was not that of a \"domestic\", it was in a sense continuous in that she worked, ate and slept on her employer's premises. The permission given her on the date of the accident to take time off constituted an interruption in her employment. While there is no direct finding by Harrison J., the effect of his reasons for judgment is that there was no interruption in her employment. The decided cases do not support such a finding. Philbin v. Hayes 3; Davidson v. M'Robb 4; L. & Y. Ry. v. Highley 5; St. Helen's Colliery v. Hewitson 6; Parker v. Black Rock 7. Davidson v. M'Robb and St. Helen's Colliery v. Hewitson are the leading English cases on the point at issue. The two latter cases are referred to with approval in McKenzie v. G.T.P. Ry. Co. 8 by Mignault J. The true position is that at the time of the accident, she was merely a licensee making use of a privilege granted her by her employer but in no way connected with the work she was employed to do. The courts have held that an accident occurring in such circumstances does not arise out of and in the course of the workman's employment. Whitfield v. Lambert 9; Standen v. Smith 10; Stringer v. O'Keeffe 11.\nThe cases relied upon by counsel for the C.P.R. and applied by Harrison J. in the judgment of the Court below are Codling v. Ridley 12 and Knight v. Howard 13. In the former case, a domestic servant was held to be acting in the course of her employment; the second held that the accident arose out of and in the course of the applicant's employment. The Knight case purports to follow the Armstrong Whitworth case 14 and therefore does not in any way weaken the authority of the cases referred to above and the principle of those cases is still applicable. After citing Codling v. Ridley and other cases Harrison J. makes this finding: \"Recreation on the hotel premises in off-duty hours was a natural incident of Miss Noell's employment * * * *\" but as pointed out by Bridges J. \"It is difficult * * * * to see how swimming at Katy's Cove was a natural incident to waiting on tables * * * *\" The question to be decided is not so much whether Miss Noell is entitled to the benefit of the Act but rather whether the C.P.R. can obtain the protection of the Act. Harrison J. erred in attaching too great significance to the element of locus. The Davidson case supra; Betts and Gallant v. The Workmen's Compensation Board 15; Davies v. Rhymney Iron Co. 16. The question of the locus of the accident is entirely irrevelant because the true question is whether the continuity of Miss Noell's employment was broken before the accident.\nAs to Q. 2\u2014Whether an application for compensation was filed in time\u2014The rights of employer and employee provided by the Act are statutory and an injured workman in order to have the benefits of the Act is required to file his application within the time limited therein. The Board has no power to award compensation unless the requirements of the Act are carried out.\nS. 16 provides that no compensation shall be payable \"unless application for such compensation is made within one year after the occurrence of the injury\". The expression \"application for compensation\" appears in no section of the Act other than s. 41(1) which states that a workman \"shall file with the Board an application for such compensation.\" It is clear, on the words of the statute, that the application under s. 41(1) can only be made by the workman and to be valid must be made within the one year period limited by s. 16. No such application was filed by Miss Noell within the time limited. The C.P.R. filed a report within a year after the accident but this was not an \"application for compensation\" at all. The report filed by the C.P.R. purportedly on behalf of Miss Noell was without her authority because through her solicitor she wholly repudiated that any such authority existed. On Jan. 2, 1951, more than a year after the accident, Miss Noell filed with the Board what purports to be an application for compensation, and by a letter of the same date purported to adopt as her own the application previously made by the C.P.R. There is a rule of English law, that ratification by a principal of an agent's prior unauthorized act does not relate back to the unauthorized act if the ratification takes place after a time limit within which the unauthorized act could be done by the principal. Lord Audley v. Pollard 17; Margaret Podger's case 18; Right dem. Fisher et al v. Cuthell 19; Doe dem. Mann v. Walters 20; Bird v. Brown 21 followed in Dibbins v. Dibbins 22. The true principle to be derived from the cases cited is that stated by Parke B. in Bird v. Brown. Although in those cases it can be said that the facts were that a jus tertii had intervened, the decisions of the courts were not based on the mere existence of this jus tertii but on broader principles. It is not sufficient as Harrison J. did, to base analogies on the similarity of facts, but rather on the applicability of the principles of law upon which analogous cases were decided. Lyell v. Kennedy 23 is not relevant, the House of Lords found no period of limitation and that judgment expressly approves the decisions in Lord Audley v. Pollard and Bird v. Brown. If it be considered that the intervention of a jus tertii is necessary to the application of the case, there is such a right in the case at bar. Because of s. 16 the Board is entitled to consider that a case is closed after the expiration of one year from the accident. Other employers in the same class are entitled to assume that their liability to assessment will depend on applications made within the year.\nAs to Q. 3, the Workmen's Compensation Board is a creature of statute and the rights, powers and remedies relevant to it are regulated by statute. Although as stated by Barry C.J. in Fleck v. Workmen's Compensation Board 24, the Act should receive a \"broad and liberal construction\", there can be no right to adjudication by an interested party unless such right is given by the Act. There is no provision in the Act allowing an application for adjudication as contemplated by Q. 3. The jurisdiction conferred by ss. 30(1) and 33(1) can only be exercised when a case is properly brought before the Board under s. 41. Dominion Canners Ltd. v. Constanza 25 was decided under s. 15(2) of the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Act, the New Brunswick Act contains no such section, and the case does not apply to the case at bar.\nC. F. H. Carson Q.C. and Allan Findlay for the respondent, the C.P.R. The majority of the judges of the Appeal Division were right in holding that the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment. The unanimous judgment was right in holding that the application was filed in time. The unanimous judgment was right in holding that Q. 3 need not be answered. If, however, this Court should take the view on the second issue that the application was not filed in time, it is submitted that question should be answered to the effect that the respondent company was nevertheless entitled to an adjudication by the Board as to whether the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment. As to Q. 1, Miss Noell's employment was continuous in nature. It was similar to that of a domestic servant living in the employer's house. As to the distinction between intermittent and continuous employment see 34 Hals. p. 832 para. 1162. Miss Noell at the time of the accident was in the course of her employment. So long as an employee engaged in continuous employment (e.g. a domestic servant living on her employer's premises) remains on her employer's premises she is acting in the course of her employment, provided of course, she is not doing something prohibited by her employer or otherwise doing something unreasonable. Davidson v. M'Robb 26. The continuity of her employment had not been interrupted at the time of the accident. It was not her day off. Though she no doubt had the right that day to leave the premises if she chose to do so, the fact remains that she was on the premises when the accident occurred, and was doing something which had not been prohibited. Indeed she was engaged in an activity (bathing) that was contemplated and permitted by her employer.\nThe accident having occurred in the course of the employment and having taken place on the employer's premises at a spot which turned out to be dangerous, it follows that the accident arose out of such employment. Lawrence v. George Mathews Ltd. 27; Brooker v. Borthwick & Sons Ltd. 28; Knight v. Howard Wall Ltd. 29. The risk to which she was exposed was a so-called \"locality risk\". Lawrence v. George Mathews Ltd., supra at p. 19; Brooker v. Borthwick & Sons Ltd., supra at p. 677. A \"locality risk\" is to be distinguished from a risk created by the employee. Codling v. Ridley 30. Since the risk was not one created by the employee but was a \"locality risk\", the question does not turn upon whether the swimming was in the performance of a duty as in Codling v. Ridley. The accident arose out of and in the course of an employment within the scope of the provisions of the Act and the appeal in respect of this question should be dismissed. The cases cited by the appellant re an accident \"arising out of\" are to be distinguished viz. the Codling case; the Brice case; Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. v. Highley 31; McKenzie v. G.T.R. 32. As to the appellant's argument that the bathing was not incidental or ancillary to her employment. If it was not unreasonable it is covered by Knight v. Howard Wall Ltd. 33. If it was incidental, it was incidental to her employment. We do not have to meet the high test of \"necessarily\" incidental as in Betts and Gallant v. Workmen's Compensation Board 34.\nAs to Q. 2. The application for compensation made by the appellant company on June 22, 1950, which purported to be on behalf of all interested persons including Miss Noell was effectively ratified by her in her letter to the Board dated Jan. 2, 1951. The injury occurred on June 23, 1949. The application as made within one year after the occurrence of the injury and so was not barred by s. 16. Although the subsequent ratification by Miss Noell did not take place within one year of the occurrence of the injury, its effect was to constitute the relation of principal and agent between Miss Noell and the respondent company because the ratification took place within a reasonable time and because no jus tertii arose before the ratification. 1 Hals. pp. 228, 229 and 234. Lyell v. Kennedy 35. Therefore the Court below was right in answering \"Yes\" to the 2nd question.\nAs to Q. 3. The Appeal Division was right in holding that it need not be answered. If, however, this court should take the view on the second issue that the application was not filed in time, Q. 3 should be answered to the effect that the respondent company was nevertheless entitled to an adjudication by the Board as to whether the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment of the respondent Noell.\nIn view of the provisions of ss. 12, 33(1) ; 33(2), it would appear that when a workman is injured in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, his right of action at common law is taken away. It would also appear that the question of whether his accident arose out of and in the course of his employment must be determined by the Board, subject in New Brunswick to an appeal under s. 35, and that the jurisdiction of the courts to determine such question is ousted accordingly. Dominion Canners Ltd. v. Costanza 36. Although no procedure is prescribed in the Act for an application being made by the employer for an adjudication and determination of the question whether an accident arose out of and in the course of employment, the right of an employer to make such an application must be implied. Ss. 16, 24, 30(1), 35(3) and 41(1) and (4).\nO. F. Howe Q.C. for the respondent Noell, stated that an action had been taken in 1950 in the Ontario court by the father of Miss Noell, a minor, and while he found himself before this court in the role of respondent, he had not filed a factum and preferred to take no part in the argument.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division 37 allowing an appeal from a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Board disallowing compensation to Marilyn Ann Noell.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\nRand J.:\u2014The facts in this controversy are not complicated. The respondent, Miss Noell, then a young woman in her 20th year and attending college, was engaged as a waitress in the hotel of the company at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, for the summer season of 1949 at the rate of $35 a month. In that capacity she was to perform such work as the company might \"appoint\". She was, \"if receiving * * * meals on the company's premises\" to take them in any place and within the hours stipulated by the manager; and if receiving sleeping accommodation, to accept such as might be assigned to her. She was to report for duty punctually and not to be off duty without permission from the head of the department. She was not to make use of the public spaces in the hotel nor its grounds used by guests nor any other place designated by the manager except when on duty and then only when so required. She was to maintain her personal state and appearance as prescribed in writing for waitresses, including regulation dress for breakfast, luncheon and dinner. These terms were embodied in a standard form of agreement which, although expressed to be applicable to different capacities, is clearly limited to employment in or about a hotel.\nNotwithstanding the clause dealing with public places, she was given oral permission to use a jetty and three floats for swimming, two golf courses and the tennis courts; for the golf, she was charged a fee of $5; the jetty, floats and tennis courts were free. In all these, she was expected to respect the prior privileges of the guests.\nShe presented herself for duty on June 4 and on June 23 the accident occurred which gives rise to this litigation. During that period she received both meals and sleeping accommodation on the hotel premises. The hotel is a well known summer resort, and its attractions, including those mentioned, are contained within a continuous area.\nThe swimming place, about half a mile from the hotel, is the mouth of a small stream flowing into Passamaquoddy Bay across the entrance of which is the line of the company's railway. In a sluiceway in the railway embankment the company has installed gates and what is so enclosed is a substantial body of water. The depth is controlled by operation of the gates, and the practice is to empty the basin every few days and refill it with fresh water from the sea. At a point near the shore, what is called the jetty has been built, which consists of a three sided rectangular boom adjoining a retaining wall enclosing a space of shallow water for children. Along the top of the boom is a walkway. Some distance outside are three swimming floats, one of which has diving stands. The jetty, by its nature, was beyond that part of the premises on which the work of a waitress would be carried out.\nThe ordinary hours for breakfast were from 7:00 to 10:00, for lunch from 11:00 or 11:30 to 2:00, and dinner from 6:30, before which waitresses would have their own dinner. Between these meals, certainly unless otherwise ordered, and during any other time off, they were free to go where or do as they pleased, even beyond the limits of St. Andrews. Under the regular schedule, each would have one day off in every seven. During the hours off, except conceivably in an emergency, they could not be recalled to the service. On the morning of June 23, at the conclusion of breakfast, she was told that she would not be required again until dinner, and she was then free for her own purposes.\nAbout 1:00 o'clock she went to the jetty intending to swim out to a float, a thing she had already done a dozen times or so before. From an outer corner of the jetty she dived into the water. The water was muddy and at the point of the dive only between two and three feet in depth. She struck bottom and suffered grave and permanent injuries. The question raised in the appeal is whether that act of diving was an act \"arising out of and in the course of\" her employment.\nThese words have produced a bewildering vagueness in interpretation and conflict in judicial application since they were first introduced into the Compensation Act of England. The comment of Fitzgibbon J. in Stringer v. O'Keeffe, 38 on what he characterizes as the \"mass of conflicting and irreconcilable decision\" and his quotation of the \"despairing cry\" of Lord Wrenbury in Armstrong v. Redford 39 that he had \"long abandoned the hope of deciding any case upon the words 'out of and in the course of upon grounds satisfactory to myself or convincing to others\" are by no means unfair. Particularly is that so in activities which are not related directly to the work; and as that is the case here we are free to approach the question from the standpoint of the broad conceptions underlying the legislation. As Viscount Haldane observed in Davidson v. M'Robb 40 :\u2014\nMy lords, the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906, appears on the face of it intended to afford a simple and speedy method of claiming compensation in the cases to which it relates * * * But around the principle which Parliament laid down in this language there is already spreading itself in Courts of Justice an atmosphere of legal subtlety which bids fair to defeat the obvious purpose of the Legislature * * * But I feel that, while in the interpretations we who are the judges put on the words used we are bound to follow our previous decisions when they form really binding precedents, we ought, in applying the statute to particular facts, to direct our efforts rather to giving effect to broad principles with freedom in applying them to individual circumstances than to searching for guidance from mere apparent analogies with the particular facts of previous cases, analogies which rarely embody the full truth. It is obvious that the basic purpose of the statute was to protect employees against the risks to which by reason of their employment, in the sense of their job, they were exposed: injury so resulting was recognized as part of the wear, tear and breakage of the work being done which the business, as part of its expense, ought to bear. The legislation was instigated by the impact of the casualty product of modern industry on the individual employee. The solution, then, must, basically, have regard to those risks.\nThe employee has, of course, his own field of activity which at some point meets that of his employment; and it is now settled that the risks extend not only to those met while he is actually in the performance of the work of the employer, but also while he is entering upon that work and departing from it.\nOrdinarily the place of the risks is the employer's premises, including means of approach and departure; but it may be elsewhere as in the case of a truck driver. On the other hand, while he is going or returning from work, on public streets, he is obviously moving in his own sphere and at his own risk.\nIt is when he is on the employer's premises, however, and is not at the moment actually furthering the employer's work or interest, that difficult questions may arise. The true interpretation of the statutory language seems to be indicated by the illustration of simple cases. If a workman at his bench straightens himself up for a momentary rest, certainly the course of his employment remains unbroken; the employment contemplates such cessations as part of itself. If he is permitted to eat a lunch while still at the bench or in the shop and he is injured, say, by an explosion of a boiler, he is equally then within the course of employment. A domestic servant, who, by her engagement, lives as a member of the household, is conceived to be on duty at all times while on the premises notwithstanding that she is not actually doing work, but, just as clearly, she is not so when she is in town shopping for herself. These examples illustrate the difference between what has been called intermittent service and intermittent cessations not of the course of employment but of its labour: they illustrate also the difference between the currency and the course of employment. Mr. Carson has argued that the claim is to be determined on the footing that the relation of the young woman to the entire premises was analogous to that of the domestic servant, and that consequently her mere presence on them is sufficient for the attribution to her of being in the course of her employment. I cannot agree that the facts bring her within that category. In no sense was she a member of a household. She had specified hours within which her time was her own, during which she was under no such kind or degree of responsibility. She was obliged to live in the hotel, no doubt, but there was no continuing duty to act unless recalled to the service. The contention so based must then be rejected: but I do not understand that the main argument depends entirely on the existence of that analogy.\nSince the accident did not arise in the course of the actual work as a waitress, nor of entering upon nor departing from it, to be within the statute her act must be found to be what has been called an incident of the work. I have already given examples of what I consider to be incidents of that nature and the fallacy, in my opinion, of the argument addressed to us, lies in this : it treats all privileges accorded an employee by reason of the employment, exercisable on the employer's premises, as incidents of the work the employee is to perform. The privilege of swimming from the jetty was conferred on the young woman as a member of the staff; so was that of golfing and of tennis: it might have been of shooting in an adjoining wood, or of travelling under a pass on the railway of the company: but from that fact it did not follow that those activities were incidents of her work.\nThese collateral advantages are not, either in their nature or by the intention of the contract, such incidents: they might be described as incidents of the contract but that is an entirely different thing; and whatever might be the view taken in any case within the area of her work, a personal act done beyond it is, prima facie, an act within the range of her own responsibility. In other words, to bring the act within the statute, the employee must be where she is either in carrying out a duty or under the coercion of the contract or in an exercise of conduct that is intimately involved, as an incident, with action in those two spheres.\nThis is illustrated in the following cases. In Philbin v. Hayes 41 a labourer had permission to put up a sleeping hut on the works of his employer which a wind blew down, seriously injuring him. He was to be provided with the hut at a small sum a day. His hours of work were from 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and he was paid by the hour. The Court of Appeal held that the accident did not arise in the course of the employment. In Gaskell v. St. Helen's Colliery Co. 42 a miner was injured while taking a bath on premises owned by the employer but leased to trustees of both the employer and workmen for the purpose of maintaining the baths. The employees were instructed that they must use the baths after each shift, but they were not subject to dismissal for not doing so. The same court held, assuming an order had been given, which was not, however, a term of the contract, that the taking of the bath did not arise in the course of the employment. Finally, in Stringer v. O'Keeffe, (supra), decided in the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, the workman was a general farm hand with no fixed hours of work who could be called upon at any time for duty. He received ten shillings a week with a house free of rent, certain supplies and the right to get firewood for his own use. While cutting trees in his own time on the employer's land, a bough fell upon him, causing injuries from which he died. It was held that he was not injured in the course of his employment.\nThe young woman, as part of her duty and of the obligation of her engagement, was to serve meals and live in the hotel. There is no more attachment or bond between the privilege of swimming at the jetty and that conduct than the privilege of travelling free on the trains of the company: the one is no more, in its nature or origin, incidental to the work than the other: both are severed from it. The second question passed on by the Appeal Division dealt with the interpretation of s. 16 of the Act which reads :\u2014\n16. No compensation shall be payable under this part in respect of any injury, unless application for such compensation is made within one year after the occurrence of the injury, or in case of death within six months from the time of death.\nThe application here was made one day before the expiration of the year by the company purporting to act on behalf of the young woman as well as of itself. Some weeks later the employee, through her solicitor, repudiated it. Still later, when she became of age, she purported to ratify it and the court held unanimously that the right was thereby preserved.\nConsidering the section apart from authority, it would seem to me to be beyond controversy that unless, at the expiration of the year, it could then be said that there was before the Board an application, nothing done afterwards could avail the employee.\nThere is no dispute that, as a general proposition, ratification of an act of purported agency must take place at a time when the act itself could be done by the principal. This is the rule of Bird v. Brown 43, in which Parke B. states it that the doctrine of ratification\nmust be taken with the qualification that the act of ratification must take place at a time and under circumstances when the ratifying party might himself have lawfully done the act which he ratifies.\nBut it is said that this rule, followed in Dibbins v. Dibbins 44, requires, in order to defeat ratification, the existence of a jus tertii and that none arose here. It was said that the qualification is warranted by Lyell v. Kennedy 45. In that case it was clearly stated that if a person professedly received money in trust for another, the limitation period was inapplicable. As the Earl of Selbourne in his speech observed :\u2014\nThese propositions appear to me to assume the main question, as to the statute running during the continuance of the self-constituted agency between the true owner and the person taking upon himself to act as agent. I find nothing to support them. in the Statute of Limitations itself; and I do not think them well founded in principle. At the most, the qualification was assumed, not applied, and as well it was assumed that the agent could be a third person.\nEven accepting the supposed qualification, I am unable to understand any difficulty in its application to this case. Certainly at the expiration of a year the right of the Board, in relation to the fund, came into existence. That fund is the object of the Board's administration and protection, and I should say that under the statute it was bound, as a duty, to see that it was dealt with strictly within the statutory requirements. We do not need to go behind the fund to the contributors who likewise are vitally interested in the manner of administration. How could the Board possibly justify using its own judgment or discretion on such a matter?\nA third question was raised going to the right of the company to apply to the Board to determine whether the accident did or did not come within the statute. This was not answered by the court in appeal, but it is pressed upon us as being one which the Board itself is anxious to have settled, and I see no reason why this Court should not accede.\nI interpret s. 16 as requiring the application for compensation to be made by the employee. That seems to me to be confirmed by s. 41:\u2014\n41. When a workman or dependent is entitled to compensation under this Part he shall file with the Board an application for such compensation * * * *\nThen s. 33 deals with the jurisdiction of the Board. It declares that, except as provided in s. 35 which provides for appeals,\nThe Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Part and as to any matter or thing in respect to which any power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the Board, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any court and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition or other process or proceeding in any court or be removable by certiorari or otherwise into any court.\nBy ss. (2) (i) this includes the finding whether an accident has arisen out of and in the course of an employment. By ss. (4) the decisions of the Board shall be upon the real merits and justice of the case, and it shall not be bound to follow strict legal precedent.\nBy s. 12 the provisions of Part I, under which the right to compensation arises, shall be in lieu\nof all claims and rights of action, statutory or otherwise, to which a workman or his dependents are or may be entitled against the employer of such workman for, or by reason of any accident in respect of which compensation is payable under this Part.\nThe question under consideration becomes important when, without any application for compensation, an action is brought against the employer for damages. By the statute of Ontario this situation is expressly met, but there is nothing in the Act under consideration which directly contemplates it.\nS. 12 must, I think, be interpreted to declare that if a right to compensation arises under Part I, then every right of action is taken away. To construe the word \"payable\" as meaning that the right to compensation has been established could be made to effect a virtual repeal of the statute in every case in which there was negligence on the part of the employer.\nIt is arguable that in an action the question is whether the right has been abrogated, but that is merely the complementary aspect of the right to compensation. Where the statute so expressly provides that the Board shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the existence of the latter, it reveals the policy that would be broken into by permitting the question of right or no right under the statute to be declared by a court. The right of appeal from the Board gives ample protection to the desirability of judicial determination of such a question as one of law, and certainly such a determination would be an answer to an action.\nAlthough the matter is not free from doubt, I think the exclusive jurisdiction conferred by s. 33 implies that the question is to be determined by the Board for all purposes and for the benefit of any person having an interest in it. The company here, then, was entitled, as it endeavoured to do, to raise that question before the Board and to have it decided. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and answer the questions in the following manner:\u2014\n1. No.\n2. No.\n3. Yes.\nCartweight J.:\u2014As to questions 1 and 3 I agree with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Rand, but in my view no answer should be made to question 2.\nThe Court of Appeal having answered question 1 in the affirmative it became necessary that they should deal with the second question but since in answering the first question we have decided that the accident to Miss Noell did not arise out of and in the course of her employment within The Workmen's Compensation Act it becomes unnecessary for us to deal with question 2 and in my view anything that we might say about it would be said obiter.\nIn answering the question we would not be called upon to decide generally as to the construction of s. 16 of The Workmen's Compensation Act but only whether under the facts of this case which are unusual and not likely to arise again, Miss Noell, had she been otherwise entitled to compensation under the Act, ceased to be so entitled because of her alleged failure to comply with the provisions of s. 16.\nIn dealing with this question the Court of Appeal does not make reference to the alleged repudiation on behalf of Miss Noell of the application for compensation which had been made to the Board on June 22, 1950. The reason for this may well be that, as we were informed by counsel, Miss Noell did not, herself, direct or authorize the sending of the letter of repudiation. On this assumption the facts with which the Court of Appeal had to deal were as follows. Miss Noell suffered very serious injuries under circumstances which it was suggested brought her within the provisions of The Workmen's Compensation Act. She was at the time of the accident a minor and was still a minor at the expiration of the year within which, under s. 16, application for compensation must be made. Within the year an application in writing was made for compensation which was expressly stated to be made on her behalf and was signed not by an irresponsible stranger but by her employer. If what has been referred to as \"the letter of repudiation\" be ignored, as was done by the Court of Appeal, there is nothing in the record to show that Miss Noell did not authorize or request the making of this application insofar as it was possible for her to do so in view of the fact that she was under age and so gravely injured that it may be she was not able to attend to any business. Her first act in reference to the matter which appears in the record after her coming of age was an adoption of the notice as her own and a further step looking to the adjudication of her claim by the Board.\nUnder these circumstances it may be that the onus of showing that the application made within the year was not authorized by Miss Noell rested upon those who were so asserting. It may be observed in passing that s. 16 is expressed in the passive voice and does not expressly require the application for compensation to be made by the claimant.\nI am not prepared to hold on the assumed state of facts set out above, which appears to me to have been that assumed by the Court of Appeal, that if Miss Noell had been otherwise entitled to compensation her claim would have been defeated by reason of the manner in which application was made but I express no final opinion on the point as in my view it is neither necessary nor desirable that we should deal with it.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Rand except that I would make no answer to question 2.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ritchie, McKelvey & MacKay.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the C.P.R.: Inches & Hazen.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Noell: Howe & McKenna.\n1 1932 (NB.) c. 36.\n2 28 M.P.R. 270; [1952] 1 D.L.R. 426.\n3 [1918] 87 L.J.K.B. 779.\n4 [(1918] A.C. 304 at 314.\n5 [1917] A.C. 352 at 372.\n6 [1924] A.C. 59.\n7 [1915] A.C. 725.\n8 [1926] S.C.R. 178 at 185.\n9 [1915] 84 L.J.K.B. 1378.\n10 (1927) B.W.C.C. 305.\n11 [1936] 70 -I.L.T. 110.\n12 (1933) 26 B.W.C.C. 3.\n13 [1938] 4 All E.R. 667.\n14 [1920] A.C. 757; 13 B.W.C.C. 68.\n15 [1934] S.C.R. 107.\n16 (1900) 16 T.L.R. 329.\n17 (1597) 78 E.R. 806.\n18 (1613) 77 E.R. 883.\n19 (1804) 102 E.R. 1158.\n20 (1830) 109 E.R. 583.\n21 (1850) 154 E.R. 1433.\n22 [1896] 2 Ch. 348.\n23 [1899] 14 A.C. 437.\n24 8 M.P.R. 33.\n25 [1923] S.C.R. 46.\n26 [1918] A.C. 304 at 314.\n27 [1929] 1 K.B. 2 at 19 and 23.\n28 [1933] A.C. 669 at 676, 677.\n29 [193S] 4 All E.R.. 667 at 672.\n30 (1933) 26 B.W.C.C. 3.\n31 [1917] A.C. 352.\n32 [1926] S.C.R. 178.\n33 [1938] 4 All E.R. 667.\n34 [1934] S.C.R. 107.\n35 (1887) 14 App. Cas. 437 at 462.\n36 [1923] S.C.R. 46.\n37 28 M.P.R. 270; [1951] 1 D.L.R. 426.\n38 (1936) 70 Ir.

Fraser, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 36\nDate: 1952-05-12\nThe Vancouver General Hospital (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nElizabeth Mildred Fraser, executrix of the estate of Gordon Arthur Fraser, Deceased (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: February 12, 13, 14, 18, 19; 1952: May 12.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nMaster and servant\u2014Hospitals\u2014Liability of hospital for negligence of interne\u2014Patient discharged with broken neck\u2014Interne incompetent to read X-rays and failed to consult radiologist\u2014Whether discharge was the cause of the death of the patient.\nThe respondent's husband, following an automobile accident, was admitted at night into the emergency ward of the appellant hospital. There, he was examined by the internes on duty and X-rays were taken. The films were not submitted to a radiologist who was on call, but the internes, although not competent to read them, proceeded to do so and advised the family physician that they had found nothing abnormal, with the result that the patient was discharged from the hospital with a dislocated fracture of the neck. The following day, he was re-admitted to the hospital by his own physician after the X-ray films had been examined by a radiologist, but died a few days later.\nThe jury rendered a general verdict against the appellant and this was affirmed in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed and the action maintained.\nHeld: The hospital undertook to treat the patient and was responsible for the negligence of its internes; and there was evidence on which the jury might properly find that the death of the patient resulted from his discharge from the hospital due to the interne's negligence either in not reading the X-ray films correctly or in not calling a radiologist.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): The hospital undertook to give the patient both nursing and medical attention, and the negligence of the interne would render the hospital liable for any resulting damage; there was however no evidence from which the jury might properly draw the inference that the ileus, which caused the death, resulted from his failure to properly diagnose the nature of the original injury or from anything done by or on behalf of Fraser in reliance upon his advise. (Ryder v. Wombwell (1868) L.R. 4 Ex. 32 referred to).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming a judgment rendered pursuant to the general verdict given by the jury in favour of the plaintiff-respondent in an action for damages. Alfred Bull Q.C. and E. A. Burnett for the appellant.\nThe responsibility for the discharge of the patient was assumed by the deceased's own doctor as appears in the evidence. But if it could be said that there was evidence on which the jury could find that that responsibility was passed back to the interne and that he accepted such responsibility, the following submissions are made: (a) the responsibility was still that of the patient's physician but if he delegated it to someone else that was merely his method of discharging his responsibility; (b) if the interne accepted the responsibility to use his own judgment on the instructions of the physician, such action would not be within the course of the interne's employment so as to make the hospital responsible for his actions; (c) The Sisters of St. Joseph v. Fleming[2] , C.P.R. v. Lockhart[3] , Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[4] , Bugge v. Brown[5] , Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors[6] and Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[7] ; (d) if the patient's own physician was not called by the respondent as a witness, the inference is that his evidence would not have been in favour of the respondent.\nThe discharge from the hospital was not the cause of the death. To show that it was is an extremely heavy burden and if closely examined would appear incapable of proof. The respondent had to show by a preponderance of evidence that the deceased would not have died had he not been discharged. The respondent's expert witness failed completely to connect the discharge with the death, and the witnesses for the appellant did not attribute the death to that cause.\nThere is no evidence of any negligence on the part of the appellant. The case is put on the basis of the decision in Vancouver General Hospital v. McDaniel[8] , because this case is one of vicarious responsibility and not one of direct attack on the system of the hospital.\nThe negligence alleged i.e. that the hospital discharged the patient when the interne ought to have known that he had suffered a dislocated fracture of the neck is not negligence in law. It is submitted that the interne made a careful examination of the X-ray films and consulted with the other interne on the reading. He did not perceive that there was a dislocated fracture because he did not have the expert knowledge necessary properly to read the film. If he did not have such expert knowledge he could not be negligent in his reading. Abel v. Cooke and Lloydminster and District Hospital Board[9] , Rich v. Pierpont[10] and Seare v. Prentice[11] .\nThere is no dispute that the interne was an employee of the appellant and if negligent that the hospital would be liable.\nPaul D. Murphy for the respondent. There was evidence to support the jury's finding that the appellant was negligent in discharging the deceased and that the employees of the hospital knew or ought to have known that the deceased at the time of the discharge had a dislocated fracture of the neck: the patient's complaints and the observed and observable symptoms of his condition, the failure of the interne to call the radiologist, etc. The charge of the trial judge has not been challenged on the issue of negligence and there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant was negligent; McConnel v. McLean[12] .\nThere was evidence to support the jury's finding that the deceased was discharged by employees of the appellant and not by his own physician. It is common ground that the physical discharge was by the hospital. That established a prima facie case against the hospital. The onus was then on the appellant to prove that the patient's physician discharged him. No doctor can have a patient in his care without seeing and diagnosing him and only the interne saw him. Therefore, Dr. Blair was not his doctor in this case. Dr. Blair could rely on the information given by the interne who was fully competent as a duly qualified practitioner and servant of the hospital. If Dr. Blair told the interne: If you think he can be discharged, go ahead. Then it becomes the discharge by the hospital.\nThere was evidence to support the jury's finding that the deceased's discharge caused his death. There was direct evidence of nerve injury or cord pressure arising out of his discharge. There was also evidence from which this could be inferred by the jury. There was also evidence that the discharge caused other fractures and dislocation i.e. additional injury contributing to nerve injury or cord pressure.\nIn the particular facts of this case the appellant is legally liable for the negligence of its internes: Evans v. Liverpool Corp.[13] , Hillyer v. St. Bartholomew's Hospital[14] and Sisters of St. Joseph v. Fleming[15] .\nThe facts were put to the jury, no attack was made on the charge to the jury and the jury could reasonably come to the conclusion to which they arrived.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014There can be no question but that the appellant hospital undertook to treat Fraser. The latter was entitled to expect that the hospital would have someone in attendance who could correctly read the X-ray film or who would call in assistance for that purpose, as was provided for by the constitution of the hospital. The appellant's system is not attacked as provision was made therein for an interne, if he considered it necessary or advisable, to call in a radiologist. Before this Court the appellant advanced no claim that if Dr. Heffelfinger were at fault it would not be responsible for the results of his negligence.\nI agree with the conclusions of my brothers Rand and Kellock that, upon a charge that has not been objected to, it was open to the jury to find (a) that Dr. Heffelfinger was negligent either in not reading the X-ray film correctly or in not calling in a radiologist; (b) that the appellant through Dr. Heffelfinger negligently discharged Fraser; (c) that such negligence caused Fraser's death.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014The respondent is the widow of a ship's officer who died in the Vancouver General Hospital in the following circumstances. Shortly after 11:00 o'clock on the night of March 8, 1949, following an automobile accident, the deceased was brought by ambulance to the emergency ward of the hospital. There were lacerations on his forehead, and he complained of pain and stiffness in his neck. At the time the ward was in the charge of Dr. Davies, serving as an interne. At midnight, Dr. Heffelfinger, also an interne came on duty. Before he arrived, Dr. Davies had communicated with Dr. Blair whose name had been given by the injured man's wife as the family doctor, and had ordered an X-ray to be taken of the injured neck. Later a general examination, including movements of the head and a neurological test, was carried out by Dr. Heffelfinger\nThe X-ray plates were received shortly afterwards, and Dr. Heffelfinger, with Dr. Davies who had remained in the ward, examined them. Dr. Heffelfinger then telephoned Dr. Blair, with a result that can best be indicated by the entry in Dr. Heffelfinger's record: \"Dr. Blair aware, and agreed to discharge and to see about eleven next a.m.\", meaning the discharge of the patient, who was to see Dr. Blair the next morning.\nDr. Heffelfinger thereupon instructed the patient to return home. At this time stiffness of the neck prevented a flexion reaching closer than one inch from the chest: the patient was in pain; and as he left the hospital, approaching 3:00 o'clock a.m. to enter a taxi, he was holding his head in his hands, somewhat bent forward. He was 31 years of age, over six feet in height, and had to stoop to enter and leave the taxicab; and the route home passed over a number of railway tracks.\nDuring the remaining hours of the night he was restless and about 9:00 a.m. Dr. Rennie was called, who reached the home around 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon. Later in the evening, after receiving, apparently, a report on the X-ray plates, Dr. Rennie ordered the patient back into the hospital which, approximately 24 hours after his discharge from the emergency ward, he reached shortly after 1:00 a.m., March 10.\nHe was then suffering from pain in the back of the neck, his neck was held rigid, and his face was flushed, and he was at once placed on a fracture board. Morphine was administered at 1:30 and at 2:00 he was asleep. At 5:00 a.m. there was less pain in his neck but pain in midback was becoming troublesome. At 10:00 a.m. he was more comfortable but extremely thirsty. On the re-admission, there was abdominal distension evidencing in fact the early stages of a condition described as an adynamic ileus; and as this is one of the vital facts in the case, it must be made intelligible. The intestinal tract is controlled by two sets of nerves, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. The latter furnish the stimulus of contraction and the former the reactive correlative of dilation or relaxation. At points in the tract there are valves that control the passage of matter along it, one of which is at approximately the junction of the small and large intestines. When the muscles of the former are contracted, this valve tends to open, and when they relax it tends to close. These nerves, as they proceed from the brain, pass the area of the injury laterally within the spinal cortex, emerging somewhat farther down. When they are damaged or irritated, their functioning may be disrupted. In that case, the intestinal muscles remain relaxed and the valve closed, and in the course of time putrefaction sets up in the matter retained. This produces gas, distension occurs, and the contents become forced back into the stomach and up through the esophagus; some may enter the lungs through the respiratory passages, and some be expelled as vomit. In short, a virtual reversal of the intestinal process may result with serious effects on other functions.\nThe X-ray plates actually revealed a fracture dislocation of the axis or second cervical or neck vertebra. The fracture was vertical and slightly behind the center line of the canal. There was a complete separation and a forward dislocation, involving the atlas and the skull, of one-third of a centimeter, on the right side of the arch or ring of the vertebra through which the cord passes; and on the left side there was a fracture commencing in the arch and running into the body of the vertebra, which is the front portion. It has not been made clear whether the latter originated or splintered on the inside or outside of the arch; Dr. Fahrni, an orthopaedic specialist, called in by Dr. Rennie, spoke of the loose portion on the right side as moving on a hinge, and that would seem to imply a split on the inside. As disclosed by the autopsy, a forward displacement of the axis on the third vertebra could be elicited by moving the head, which might mean a movement of the entire axis. Dr. Fahrni spoke of the vertebra as being \"unstable.\" There was hemorrhage where the ligaments of the neck had been torn on the right side; and the brain tissue and the upper segments of the cord were found to be watery with oedema.\nAt 12:30 p.m. Dr. Fahrni made his first visit. He did not then consider it safe to put the patient through the motions of another X-ray picture. In addition to what the X-ray plates indicated, and the abdominal distension, there was an absence of borborygami, the normal gurgling sound from the intestines, with the abdomen tympanitic to percussion. What the situation demanded was obvious, to restore the intestines to their normal functioning, and to remove any possible complication by eliminating the dislocation in the axis. The patient's body was thereupon placed in extension, that is, so that the head, by its own weight, would tend to fall back: later, at 6:00 p.m., traction was applied, which means that extra weight was added to the downward drag of the head itself. The usual neurological reaction tests for evidences of nerve disturbance were made, but none found.\nAs a similar test had shown a similar result in the emergency ward, this is taken by Mr. Bull as demonstrating that there had not, up to the time of the re-admission, been any nerve injury resulting from the fracture. But this view takes no account of the significance of distension and the other conditions present upon re-admission. It disregards also the fact that from 1:15 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. when the test by Dr. Fahrni was made, the patient had lain on the fracture board; and from the medical evidence it was open to the jury to infer that in that time, through the automatic reaction of the muscles, the dislocation might have been reduced sufficient to mitigate pain and nerve irritation provoked between the discharge and the readmission. That there was such an irritation is deduced by the respondent from the fact of the ileus; Dr. Kempt draws that conclusion: and Dr. Naden, an orthopaedic specialist, agreed that the conditions on re-admission could be evidence of nerve injury or irritation notwithstanding there appeared to have been no physically demonstrable neurological change. But Mr. Murphy is not confined to nerve injury trauma as the instigating factor of the ileus. Admittedly the causal agencies in that derangement are obscure. Dr. Fahrni was emphatic that here was a case, from the beginning, for the utmost care in treatment and the immediate immobilization of the injured area. The fact that on one occasion after the dislocation had been eliminated, the patient had got up and walked across the room involved so much risk of displacement that Dr. Fahrni had an X-ray taken as the patient lay in bed, indicates the importance he attached to eliminating any possible effect on the ileus of the dislocation. He agreed that the shock of such an accident would undoubtedly disturb the autonomous nerve systems, including those controlling intestinal action; and that its onset could have been hastened by the 24 hours' neglect. He hesitated significantly in speaking of the watery or oedematic condition of the cord, the \"degeneration\" mentioned in the death certificate: it indicated pathological change which he thought more likely to be a circulatory change than an injury, if ante mortem; and the \"moot point\" was whether it was post or ante mortem.\nNeither Dr. Fahrni nor Dr. Naden presented any theory of the cause of the ileus. Dr. Fahrni admitted frankly that he had none. Dr. Naden speculated somewhat between a range from the patient's lying on his back on the fracture board to any degree of pathological change or involvement of the nerves, including nerve irritation, of which the ileus itself could be evidence. He played with the idea of dehydration of the patient's body on the footing of his alcoholic breath. This, in a proper case, would produce an imbalance in the equilibrium of vital processes; but in the situation here his suggestion could properly be treated by the jury as quite beyond any relevancy to the task before them. In relation to the posture on the bed, what he apparently meant, although he did not trace the sequences, is that in the case of such a man, well built and physically vigorous, to arouse notions of injury and to place him under a regimen of such constraint might in some way set up functional nerve irritability. But the ileus was in its first stages before such a posture or the fracture board had appeared. On the other hand, the medical evidence is convincing that the case was one that from the beginning called for the strictest care until the condition had been fully diagnosed. The stiff neck\u2014the broken neck, with the skull itself displaced\u2014and the pain, were danger signals of unmistakable nature and called for only one mode of treatment. Dr. Naden at one point gave it as a considered judgment that if at that moment the patient had been told to go home and forget that he had been in an accident, he \"would have been alive today\"; but this was followed by the admission that in all likelihood he would have followed the same course of treatment as Dr. Fahrni, and by such other concessions and qualifications as, in the light of the stark facts, most likely nullified his evidence in its entirety.\nIt was agreed that in the absence of a destructive lesion to the cord, a broken vertebra is not in these days, as formerly, looked upon as a grave injury, and the normal prognosis is recovery. There may, of course, be cases in which the fracture and even dislocation may be such as to call for no treatment whatever; the bone, in such cases, adapts itself to the new position and may have either no or slight effects thereafter. But even where great care and competent treatment are called for, recovery is normally to be expected.\nThe jury must then have looked for some circumstances out of the ordinary of such a character as could properly be taken to be the significant factor in the situation before them. What must be kept in mind is that finding the cause is for the jurors and not the experts. These specialists are to assist the jury, not to direct them and much less to determine the fact to be found. And that finding is to be gathered by the jury from all of the circumstances, including the opinions of the professional men, but weighing them in the total complex of the controversy.\nViewing that complex as a whole, then, how can it be said that the jury could not here adjudge the unique circumstance that this man was subjected to a deprivation of initial vital care and treatment for 24 hours to be the essential and operative factor in bringing about what followed? No other factor has been seriously suggested. Fatal consequences in injuries of this kind, as the evidence indicates, have too frequently been traced to just such initial failures; and that they could find that this delinquency most probably led to the onset of the ileus in an aggravated degree that steadily deepened until death in five days, is, I think, undoubted. The alternatives, that this man was of a type peculiarly susceptible to ileus or that death would inevitably have ensued the accident, have not in the evidence the support of a syllable.\nBut there are two remaining grounds. Mr. Bull argues, first, that there was no negligence on the part of the interne, Dr. Heffelfinger, and secondly, that the discharge of the patient was by his own doctor and not by the hospital. These really merge into one question: was there any negligence on the part of the hospital which caused or contributed to the day's absence from the hospital? and that I now examine.\nAt the threshold of the enquiry stands this question: what did the hospital undertake toward the deceased when he entered the emergency ward for treatment? As can at once be seen, various matters enter into that determination. Mr. Bull introduces the regulation of the hospital dealing with the procedure in that ward; it is contained in the Hospital Manual, and is as follows:\u2014\nAny member of the house staff called to the emergency department must respond promptly. It is imperative that every emergency case be examined immediately and given such first aid treatment as is necessary on admission for making him as safe and comfortable as possible. After this, get in touch with the patient's physician and act under his orders. Specific instructions are posted in the emergency department. Report forms are to be completed in each case.\nThis was supplemented by the evidence of Dr. Seymour, the assistant medical director. Interneship is a preliminary hospital experience for young doctors, but whether voluntary or required does not appear. In this case, Dr. Heffelfinger was under a contract which had run for approximately nine months, and during that time he held a temporary license to practice medicine within the confines of the hospital.\nThat primary undertaking, symbolized in the scope of real or apparent authority of the interne, is to be gathered from all the circumstances of the entrance of the patient into the hospital, of what is sought by him and the nature of what is done to and for him. There is first the fact that he enters a hospital to which sick or injured persons resort for treatment; the patient would see both a doctor and a nurse; a preliminary examination is made of him, in which all the usual questions of a physician are put to him; there is an enquiry as to the family physician, who is spoken to on the telephone: there is the order for the X-ray, the interpretation of it, and the report made to the physician: all the ritual and paraphernalia of medical service. From all this it is clear that although the hospital indicates, the interposition of the family physician, the interne is to be more than a mere untutored communicant between him and the patient. By the terms of the regulation, he is to \"examine immediately and get in touch with the physician and act thereafter under his orders;\" but for that examination and report he must use the undertaken degree of skill, and that cannot be less than the ordinary skill of a junior doctor in appreciation of the indications and symptoms of injury before him, as well as an appreciation of his own limitations and of the necessity for caution in anything he does.\nDr. Heffelfinger's evidence is all we have on his report. He says: \"I only gave him my findings and let him decide what to do with it\u2014I described my findings in examination\u2014and the X-ray findings, and asked him what he wanted to do about it, and the outcome of it was that he asked me to discharge him and come around in the morning\"; and, speaking of the work of an interne generally, \"also for the reason to report the results of my examination as well\u2026 it is part of the routine under circumstances such as that to look at the films and report them to the attending doctor.\" He claims to have warned Dr. Blair that he had had only a limited experience with X-ray plate reading; but he had come to the opinion that there was no fracture; and that he may have expressed that opinion, and also that it would be safe to allow the patient to leave, could be drawn from his evidence.\nNow, was that opinion one that ought to have been given here by Dr. Heffelfinger without such qualifications as would have nullified it in the ears of Dr. Blair? The indications on the plates were perfectly clear to him at the trial; would the jury be warranted in concluding that holding such an opinion he would be unlikely to convey a true picture of the patient's condition, including that evidence of it which was described to the jury by his wife? The stark facts, the danger signs, that should have demanded verification to any doctor, interne or not, were the rigid neck and the pain. In the presence of these, to be able to minimize the injury as he did on the departure from the hospital, when the victim of it was suffering from a displaced skull, would justify the inference that his report to Dr. Blair must have been a pallid or deprecatory description of the clinical facts; and even though there may have been sufficient as it was to arouse the suspicions of Dr. Blair, that would not excuse its inadequacy or its falsity in fact.\nDr. Heffelfinger went beyond the mere communication of Dr. Blair's advice or instructions to the patient. On the wife's evidence, he actively reasured both the deceased and her, notwithstanding her hesitant acceptance of it, that there was nothing seriously wrong and no ground for anxiety. He was, of course, acting in good faith, but he failed, not, it may be conceded, in reading the plate incorrectly, but in not being more acutely sensitive to the grave symptoms that stood out before him and in not exercising caution against his inexperience, in not seeking verification. That misreading, concurred in apparently by Dr. Davies, and, on the communication, by Dr. Blair, created in him a settled opinion of the worst possible error. In these reassurances he was not exhibiting the skill and care which the hospital undertook would be exercised in the ward; and that insufficiency, regardless of whether or not he was acting on behalf of Dr. Blair, was the agency that gave rise to the fatal event that followed. On those assurances, the husband and the wife placed reliance and acted. The jury had before it evidence from which it could conclude that his duty as the representative of the hospital toward the patient was not, in the circumstances, performed by allowing the injured man to leave in the condition in which he was: and for that the hospital must answer.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014Contrary to the appellant's contention, there was evidence, in my opinion, upon which the jury were entitled to find that the hospital did undertake to treat the deceased and negligently discharged him in what was actually a serious condition. The deceased was admitted at 11:10 p.m. of March 8, and shortly after, his wife, upon being notified and asked the name of the family doctor, gave the name of Dr. Blair. Dr. Davies, the interne in charge of the emergency ward at the time, had already ordered an X-ray to find out whether or not there was any fracture of the cervical vertebrae when Dr. Heffelfinger came on duty, about midnight, and the patient had been X-rayed. Shortly thereafter, he and Dr. Davies examined the films, concluded that there was \"no gross abnormality,\" and telephoned that information to Dr. Blair. According to the report prepared by Dr. Heffelfinger, Dr. Blair \"agreed\" to the discharge of the patient. Dr. Blair had previously been spoken to on the telephone by Dr. Davies, but as neither was called it is not known what passed in this conversation.\nDr. Heffelfinger at first took the position in evidence that he was not qualified to read X-ray films. This he subsequently modified by saying that neither he nor Dr. Davies was qualified to give an \"expert\" opinion. There was on call at the hospital at all times, however, a radiologist who could have given such expert opinion had either Dr. Heffelfinger or Dr. Davies thought it necessary, and I think it was quite open to the jury to find that the two internes undertook to read and felt quite competent to read the particular films. Dr. Heffelfinger testified:\nQ. Why did you look at them at all, Doctor?\nA. It is part of the routine to, under circumstances such as that, to look at the films and report them to the attending doctor.\nQ. Then you wish the jury to believe that you were qualified to read X-ray films?\nA. In a sense, yes.\nQ. Qualify it all you want. What kind of sense? We want to understand this, please.\nA. Under the circumstances, I was qualified to read the films, yes, as an interne, but I was not qualified to give an expert opinion on the films.\nI think there was quite sufficient evidence for the jury to find that what occurred was in accord with that which the hospital well understood was its undertaking to the public, namely to examine the deceased, including examination by X-rays as a matter of routine, to read the films, and to report the findings to the deceased's physician. I do not think the evidence precluded the jury from finding that the situation was other than one in which the deceased's physician was in charge of the whole procedure and was accepting sole responsibility for what occurred.\nI think it was open to the jury to conclude that if X-rays of the particular area of the spinal cord here in question are difficult to read and require a person with more training than either of them had, the internes were negligent in failing to use the means at hand, namely, to call the radiologist to obtain a proper reading. The whole purpose of the X-rays was to ascertain whether or not the deceased had sustained a fracture. In fact he had, and Dr. Heffelfinger, on his examination for discovery admitted it was obvious from the X-ray films that such was the case. In my opinion, therefore, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could find negligence on the part of the appellant in connection with the discharge of the deceased from the emergency ward.\nComing to the question as to whether or not the respondent sufficiently established that the negligence was the cause of death, it is to be borne in mind that\nConclusions of fact embodied in the verdict of the jury cannot be subjected to the same degree of re-examination (as in the case of appeals from a judge sitting alone) for the course of reasoning by which the verdict has been reached is not disclosed, and consequently, the verdict of the jury on fact must stand if there is any evidence to support it and if the conclusion is one at which a reasonable jury when properly directed, might reasonably arrive.\nWatt v. Thomas[16] , per Viscount Simon.\nIt is common ground that the deceased had no involvement of his nervous system at the time of his discharge from the emergency ward in the early hours of March 9. Further, all the medical witnesses agree that an injury such as that here in question need not be serious provided early treatment is received. It is true that Dr. Naden gave it as his opinion that the deceased might well have been alive today had he received no treatment, but he also said that had he been attending the case he probably would have followed the procedure which was in fact followed. The jury on this point, as on all others, were entitled to discriminate as between witnesses and as between different parts of the evidence of the same witness. The certificate of death, the contents of which, we were given to understand, constitute by statute prima facie evidence, discloses the cause of death as \"Bronchopneumonia, paralytic ileus. Fracture dislocation of axis and atlas. Contributory: Softening and edema (degeneration) of medulla and cervical cord.\" According to the autopsist, the lungs were edematous and were typical of bronchopneumonia. These conditions he described as \"terminal,\" that is, resulting from the paralytic ileus. He also found edema of the medulla and the upper segments of the spinal cord as well as a softening in the cord as a result of the edema. He testified:\nQ. Now, so far as the time element is concerned in these injuries, is it correct that you say the condition, I think you said it, the conditions were caused by the fracture of the axis, the fracture dislocation of the axis?\nA. That is correct, or an injury to the neck, which resulted in the fracture dislocation.\nThis answer was understood by all counsel concerned as a statement that the edema both of the lungs and of the cord were \"terminal\" in the same sense, that is, as resulting from the ileus. Dr. Kemp, called for the respondent, testified in chief as follows:\nQ. Assuming\u2026 he dies of a paralytic ileus which, as Dr. Harmon says, caused at least two terminal conditions, bronchopneumonia\u2014I have forgotten the other\u2014\nA. Edema of the lung.\nQ. Thank you, doctor. Edema of the lung, and softening of the cord and edema of the cord.\nCounsel for the appellant proceeded on the same footing.\nBefore dealing further with the respondent's evidence, it will be convenient to refer to evidence adduced by the appellant. Dr. Fahrni, who was called to attend the deceased on his re-entry to the hospital, but who did not see him until approximately 12:30 p.m. of March 10, made a neurological examination similar to that conducted by Dr. Heffelfinger when the patient was in the emergency ward. Dr. Fahrni, after stating that this examination indicated \"no sign of any neurological involvement,\" then gave the following answers:\nQ. When you say that, do you mean not only the spinal cord but the nervous system? Generally speaking, the nervous system?\nA. Yes. Q. And when you say the nervous system, do you mean including the central nervous system\u2014not only the central nervous system but the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system?\nA. That is a difficult question to answer, in that anyone who has had any injury has nearly always obvious upsets in their automatic nerve system.\nIt is clear, I think, on the evidence, that when the deceased returned to the hospital in the early morning hours of March 10, his abdominal condition indicated that the ileus had already set in. Dr. Fahrni says that the \"first symptom\" he observed of the ileus was distension of the abdomen, and Dr. Naden, who was called on behalf of the appellant, testified that when the deceased got back to the hospital, it was his understanding that the condition then existed. That this was accepted at the trial appears, I think, from the following cross-examination of Dr. Kemp by counsel for the appellant:\nQ. Speak up.\nA. It was read to me in evidence that the man on re-entering hospital had abdominal distention, and what is known as meterism, or gas, which correctly means a swelling which would indicate an early ileus.\nQ. What you say, of course, appears in the medical chart. There was some distention of his abdomen.\nA. Yes, sir.\nThe medical chart referred to is the \"history sheet\" which discloses the condition referred to, with respect to which, in the course of his cross-examination of Dr. Fahrni, counsel for the respondent stated, without correction from any quarter,\nThat history sheet is obviously made up when Mr. Fraser comes back.\nThe case was expressly put to the jury on this footing by the learned trial judge in his charge, and there was no objection on this point by counsel for the appellant. I think, therefore, it is too late for the appellant to take any other position.\nWith respect to the activities of the deceased subsequent to his discharge from the emergency ward and prior to his re-entry to the hospital, Dr. Fahrni testified that these could bring about a speeding up of the onset of shock, and further,\nQ. Yes?\nA. The other thing is that the cervical spine was obviously unstable, and it could have gone on with further displacement and put pressure on the spinal cord. In answer to the question as to whether or not there was any evidence of that happening, the witness said there was none. However, Dr. Naden testified:\nQ. There were no neurological signs of any kind or description whatsoever?\nA. Not when he was discharged from the hospital or at any other time.\nQ. Except the bowel distention.\nA. That's not a neurological sign.\nQ. It might be a sign of neurological injury, or nerve injury?\nA. Yes, I think one would have to say that that is a possibility, but once again in this patient, and it is this patient we are speaking of, in this patient as far as it has been physically possible to demonstrate there was no evidence of neurological change.\nHe subsequently said with respect to the bowel distention:\nThere is no evidence that this was caused by nerve injury. It is evidence of nerve irritation, but the evidence could be from nerve irritation by traction on the sympathetic plexus and lower dorsal and upper lumbar region, which is the reason you get a paralytic ileus in abdominal\u2014post-operative abdominal conditions from traction of the sympathetic plexus which is not\u2014which one cannot call injury apart from traction and not injury in the interpretation I make of your question.\nThere had been, of course, no traction by external means to which the deceased had been subjected prior to his reentry into the hospital, and no evidence at all of any other traction. Without explanation, and the witness gave none, this reference to traction was quite irrelevant. Dr. Naden also said:\nQ. Well now, doctor, what I want to know is\u2014and what I want the jury to know\u2014is this, can, in your opinion, a paralytic ileus be brought about by reason of an injury (a) to the spinal cord; (b) by an injury to the sympathetic nervous system?\nA. It can be. It can be.\nDr. Fahrni expressed the view that the type of fracture from which the deceased suffered was not one which tended to close the canal of the spine as the head is carried forward, but rather which opened the canal the further the head was taken forward,\nand unless the head is taken extremely far forward, there would be no pressure on the cord at all.\nDr. Fahrni also said that when he was called into the case and met the deceased's doctor, Dr. Rennie, at the hospital, he was shown the X-rays which had already been taken. When he testified, therefore, that there would be no pressure on the cord of the deceased unless the head was moved \"extremely far forward,\" he was aware of the nature of the fracture and the dislocation, and with that knowledge he had already testified that the cervical spine of the deceased was \"obviously unstable\" and \"it could have gone on with further displacement and put pressure on the spinal cord.\"\nDr. Fahrni also said that, according to the X-ray, the dislocation \"went one third of a centimetre,\" which, however, was not the maximum extent of the dislocation; it probably went \"a little bit further,\" at the time of the accident, and \"could be pushed forward again by forward flexion of the neck,\" which was one of the dangers to be avoided. So much so was this the case that when Dr. Fahrni took charge of the deceased, he did not consider it \"safe\" to put the latter through the motions of having X-rays taken to see whether, as a result of the deceased's activities, any increase in the displacement had occurred. He said that whether or not a greater dislocation had occurred could have been ascertained exactly by taking an X-ray picture, and that on his re-admission he would want to know whether any change either in the dislocation or the extent of the fracture had occurred \"for one reason only,\" and that was \"to ascertain whether there had been any pressure on the cord.\"\nQ. That is very important, isn't it?\nA. Yes.\nHe further testified:\nQ. There wasn't anything particular about his condition, was there, that prevented you from taking an X-ray?\nA. No, except that I didn't want him moved.\nQ. Why didn't you want him moved?\nA. I wouldn't want anyone moved in a condition of that nature, unless there was a particular indication for it.\nQ. You mean, doctor, that you wouldn't want him to indulge in any activity at all? Is that what you mean?\nA. Yes.\n***\nQ. Yes, but you could have got the portable machine in?\nA. The movements are not in moving his bed along the hall there, but in actually taking the film and placing the cassettes behind his head and so forth. Q. You mean any moving of his body at all? That was what you wanted to avoid, moving his body at all?\nA. Moving his neck.\nQ. All right, moving his neck at all?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You wanted to avoid that?\nA. Yes.\nI think it was quite open to the jury to infer from this evidence that if Dr. Fahrni, with his knowledge of the patient, including his history and the nature of the fracture dislocation from which he suffered as disclosed by the X-rays, knew there was a very real danger of the cord being subjected to pressure by movements of the head, even in the course of taking X-rays which he would assume would be done with the greatest care by servants of the hospital under his direction, there was much more likelihood that pressure had been put on the cord by the uncontrolled movements of the patient while he had been absent from the hospital.\nThe language which Dr. Fahrni had used in the early part of this evidence was, as already mentioned, that he did not consider it \"safe\" to take X-rays. Subsequently he went on to say that one reason he did not want the deceased to indulge in any activity was that he was in pain. The connection between pain and being \"safe\" was not explained and is not obvious unless the witness meant that pain caused by uncontrolled activity on the part of the patient could itself bring about an upset in the automatic nervous system. The witness, however, did not say this. A further reason he gave was that he wanted to reduce the fracture and keep it reduced. Thus the patient would have a better neck than if left the way it was. He then said he had \"no other reasons\" for not wanting the patient to indulge in activities. This was, however, immediately followed by the following evidence:\nQ. Well, isn't there another reason for reducing the dislocation, so that no pressure will be caused on the cord?\nA. That is all included in my qualification.\nQ. All right, doctor, I am just trying to take the lid off, if I may. That is one reason for reducing a dislocation, to prevent injury of the cord, or pressure on the cord, isn't it?\nA. In the way your question came to me, no. You asked me\u2014we had him lying on his back in bed. Once he is there, no possible damage to the cord can take place. Q. I know that, yes, all right; and you want to reduce the dislocation and reduce it so no damage can occur to the cord, is that correct?\nA. Yes, in a way.\nQ. What do you mean, in a way?\nA. I would say to diminish the danger of damage to the cord.\nQ. All right, thank you, to eliminate damage or danger of damage to the cord.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Now, we have that. That is one reason for reducing dislocation, correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In other words, it is highly important, and that is one reason for your immobilization, isn't it?\nA. What?\nQ. One reason for immobilizing is so that the dislocation won't become any worse, or the bones won't move?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that there won't be any damage to the cord?\nA. To diminish the danger of damage to the cord.\nThe witness continued:\nQ. Now, if you want to increase that danger, you tell him to get up and go home, don't you? If you deliberately wanted to increase the danger of damage to the cord, you would tell him to get up and go home?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And, of course, you know that was done in this case?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that that was a highly dangerous thing, at least?\nA. Yes, I will admit it was a dangerous thing to do.\nQ. A very dangerous thing to do, doctor, wasn't it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Because it might have caused injury to the cord?\nA. Yes, it might have.\nQ. And, in fact, he did have injury to the cord at death?\nA. You are asking me?\nQ. I am asking you.\nA. I don't know.\nDr. Fahrni also said with respect to the cause of the ileus that he could not say \"that the fracture dislocation of his axis did not cause it.\"\nDr. Kemp, called on behalf of the respondent, said that the treatment generally accepted was extension, the purpose being two-fold: first, to prevent flexion of the neck and spine to avoid damage to the cord; second, to allow the fractured bones to heal. The danger to be guarded against above all things was flexion. He testified that in his opinion the activity of the deceased after discharge from the emergency ward \"must have\" caused pressure upon the cord. Mr. Bull for the appellant found a good deal, and properly so, upon the admission of this witness that, when testifying in chief, he had not known of Dr. Fahrni's neurological examination of the deceased. I think the fair reading of this witness's evidence is, however, that notwithstanding the results of that examination, Dr. Kemp considered that the abdominal distention in evidence some hours earlier on the patient's re-admission to the hospital was itself evidence of nerve injury or nerve irritation.\nQ. And you had no information when you gave your answer to Mr. Murphy's hypothetical question what the result of that examination was?\nA. Except I believe it was read there was a meterism and distention in the man's abdomen.\nQ. Speak up.\nA. It was read to me in evidence that the man on re-entering the hospital had abdominal distention, and what is known as meterism, or gas, which correctly means a swelling which would indicate an early ileus.\nQ. What you say, of course, appears in the medical chart. There was some distention of his abdomen.\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. I think it was the first day he got back to the hospital. I am not referring to that at all. Just leave that out. I am referring to the neurological examination which Dr. Fahrni would make when he was called in on the case.\nA. I have no knowledge of Dr. Fahrni's examination.\nQ. And you had no knowledge of the result of that, if he made one, when you gave that answer yesterday?\nA. No, unless it was a part of what was read.\nQ. And that is, of course, very important?\nA. Oh, yes, definitely.\nQ. Dr. Fahrni would know, I presume, when he attended the man on his re-entry in the hospital, whether there was any apparent nerve damage?\nA. Not necessarily. Dr. Fahrni is an orthopedic specialist. They are not known for their knowledge of the nervous system.\nThe witness was further cross-examined with respect to the effect of the activities through which the deceased went while out of the hospital, and he said :\nQ. Even being home. What would those activities result in, scientifically?\nA. Scientifically they could result in a further increase of the dislocation, eventually leading up to pressure on the cord.\nQ. You don't suggest they did that.\nA. They must have.\nQ. What you say is they could do that.\nA. They could do that and they probably did. This witness would not agree with the evidence that the maximum dislocation had occurred at the moment of impact.\nIn my opinion, on the whole of the evidence, the relevant parts of which I have endeavoured to review, I do not think it can be said that there was no evidence upon which the jury could have reached the finding they did. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[17] , dismissing the appeal of the Vancouver General Hospital from the judgment of Coady, J. following the verdict of a jury.\nThe respondent is the widow and the personal representative of the late Gordon Arthur Fraser and in that capacity brought the action on behalf of herself, her infant son and the mother of the deceased.\nIn so far as they are relevant to the issue of negligence, the facts are as follows: shortly after 11 o'clock on the evening of March 8, 1949, Fraser, who had been injured in an automobile accident, was admitted into the emergency ward of the Vancouver General Hospital for treatment. The Vancouver Hospital contains some 1,200 beds and is equipped with all the usual accessories of a first class hospital, including an X-ray department. The emergency ward consists of 7 beds for the reception of accident cases and is staffed with nurses, orderlies and internes and, at the time of Fraser's admission, Dr. Davies was the interne on duty. The emergency accident report shows that Fraser was suffering on admission from a ragged laceration to his right forehead and pain and stiffness in the posterior portion of the neck. Dr. Davies, who was not called as a witness at the trial, signed a requisition for an X-ray some time prior to midnight, this stating that the patient might be taken to the X-ray department on a stretcher, that the part to be radiographed was \"the neck, the cervical vertebrae\" and in the space provided on the form for \"Information desired\" there appeared the following: \"? fracture\" According to the respondent, one of the nurses telephoned to her shortly after 11 o'clock, informing her of the accident and asking who was their family doctor, in response to which she gave the name of Dr. Harold Blair. In the space reserved for the name of the patient's doctor on the X-ray requisition form, the name J. H. Blair appears. At midnight Dr. R. M. Heffelfinger, an interne, a graduate of the Manitoba Medical College, who held a temporary licence from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia entitling him to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery within the confines of the Vancouver General Hospital, came on duty, apparently to relieve Dr. Davies.\nMrs. Fraser arrived at 11.40 p.m. before the X-rays were taken and found her husband in bed complaining that his neck was very stiff and sore. According to her, she asked Dr. Heffelfinger:\nif there was going to be a doctor who was in charge\nsaying that it was supposed to be Dr. Blair, who had been phoned by Dr. Heffelfinger, and asked if Blair was coming to the hospital and was told that he was not coming until he (Heffelfinger):\u2014\nhad taken the X-ray and given him a report of the X-ray plates.\nThereafter she says that Dr. Heffelfinger sutured the cut on her husband's forehead and she then apparently waited in the ante room while her husband was taken to the X-ray department. After a wait of some 45 minutes Mrs. Fraser said that she was told that her husband could go home. She thereupon went to the ward where he was in bed and gives the following account of what then took place:\nDr. Heffelfinger\u2026 stood at the foot of the bed and I on the right side of the bed and my husband, Mr. Fraser, said to Dr. Heffelfinger that his neck was very stiff and he couldn't move it and it was extremely sore and he said, \"There must be something wrong with my neck,\" which (sic) Dr. Heffelfinger in turn assured him it was merely strained ligaments, muscular or glandular trouble, at the time.\nWhile her husband was being dressed by the nurse she said that she felt that he should not be leaving the hospital and went and talked to Dr. Heffelfinger again, saying :\nDr. Heffelfinger, are you sure that there is no more serious injury than what you have stated in your conversation at Gordon's bedside?\nand had been assured that there was not. She had telephoned for a taxicab to take them home and while they were waiting for this to come she says that Dr. Heffelfinger came and said to her husband that he was to go down to Dr. Blair's office at 11 o'clock that morning, to which her husband had replied that if he was no better first thing in the morning Dr. Blair or some other doctor was coming to see him.\nAccording to Dr. Heffelfinger, when he came on duty he conducted a neurological examination of Fraser to ascertain if there was any evidence of injury to the nervous system and found none. He was asked by Fraser if Dr. Blair had been notified and he said that this had been done. Fraser then asked if Dr. Blair was coming down, to which he replied that he did not know whether he was or not. Apparently, it was Dr. Davies who had telephoned to Dr. Blair and there is no evidence as to what took place between them. There appears, however, on the emergency accident report, which was signed by Dr. Heffelfinger, a notation that the family physician was notified at 12.05 a.m. this apparently being before the X-rays were taken. Following the taking of the X-rays, Dr. Heffelfinger says that he examined the prints together with Dr. Davies. After this he telephoned to Dr. Blair describing the patient's condition, the results of the examination, and:\nthe results of the X-ray as interpreted by the other interne and myself.\nand told Dr. Blair that the patient was most insistent about going home and asked him (Blair) what he wanted to do and was told to discharge the patient and have him see him at the office \"the following morning.\" In chief, asked whether he was qualified to read X-ray plates, he said he was not, that his only experience in that field was the usual teaching received in a medical school and instructions received in the hospital as an interne up to that time but that he had not taken any post graduate or special training in radiology. Asked as to whether he had told this to Dr. Blair, he said: \"I informed him to that effect.\" Cross-examined, he said that internes were permitted to order X-rays when required and read them and give a report \"after first contacting the attending doctor.\" As neither Dr. Davies nor Dr. Blair gave evidence, whether the latter asked for the X-ray was not disclosed. Dr. Heffelfinger said that their examination of the X-rays disclosed no gross abnormality. He said that he had been requested by Dr. Blair to examine the films, and again:\nWe were requested by him to look at the films and to report to him our findings.\nThe latter statement apparently referred to Dr. Davies and himself and as, so far as the evidence shows, Dr. Heffelfinger had only spoken once to Dr. Blair, the request last referred to was presumably made to Dr. Davies. When he was asked again if what he had told Dr. Blair was that he and Dr. Davies could find nothing grossly abnormal and confirmed this, he again said that he had told Dr. Blair that he (Heffelfinger) \"had not very much experience in reading X-ray films.\" While the doctor could not remember whether or not he had assured Mrs. Fraser that her husband's condition was not serious or that the injury might be a strained ligament or some glandular strain which caused his neck to be stiff, he denied that he had advised Dr. Blair that, in his opinion, Fraser could be discharged. In concluding the cross-examination Dr. Heffelfinger was asked if he had said in his examination for discovery that he had not expressed to Dr. Blair any opinion regarding discharge of the patient but had only given the latter his findings and let him decide what to do, and that after describing his findings on his examination and the X-ray findings he had :\nasked him what he wanted to do about it, and the outcome of it was that he asked me to discharge him and come around in the morning.\nhe confirmed having done so.\nDr. R. A. Seymour, the Assistant Medical Superintendent of the hospital, gave evidence as to the hospital rules regarding the emergency department, one of which provided that :\nAny member of the house staff called to the emergency department must respond promptly. It is imperative that every emergency case be examined immediately and given such first-aid treatment as is necessary on admission for making him as safe and comfortable as possible. After this, get in touch with the patient's physician and act under his orders. Specific instructions are posted in the emergency department. Report forms are to be completed in each case.\nIt was apparently in accordance with this rule that Dr. Davies and Dr. Heffelfinger telephoned to Dr. Blair and obtained his instructions and that Dr. Heffelfinger made the emergency accident report. The Vancouver General Hospital has a large X-ray department and, while there were only technicians on duty at night, there was a radiologist who was always on call and for whose opinion Dr. Blair might have asked. Unfortunately in the result this was not done. It was made clear by Dr. Seymour that the internes were permitted to order X-rays to be taken and, if requested, to report what they disclosed to the patient's doctor.\nIt is now common ground that the X-ray films disclosed a fracture dislocation of the second cervical (axis) vertebra and that this was not detected by Dr. Heffelfinger. There was also evidence which, if believed, would indicate that it was a dangerous thing to send Fraser home in a taxicab in this condition. The allegations of negligence are that the defendant, its servants or agents so negligently and unskilfully diagnosed or treated Fraser that he thereafter died. It is contended that the activities carried on by Fraser in reliance upon Dr. Heffelfinger's advice in the interval between his leaving the hospital to go home and the time of the discovery of the nature of his injury resulted in his death.\nAt the conclusion of the trial and following a most careful charge by the learned trial judge the following questions dealing with the matter of the alleged negligence of Dr. Heffelfinger were submitted to the jury:\n(1) Were the internes the servants or agents of Dr. Blair in discharging the deceased?\n(2) Were the internes, if your answer to (1) is \"no\", were the internes the employees of the defendant in discharging the deceased?\n(3) Were the internes negligent in discharging the deceased?\n(4) If your answer to Question (3) is \"yes\", did that negligence cause the deceased's death?\n(5) If your answer to Question 4 is \"yes\", what damages do you find were suffered by:\n(a) Mrs. Fraser Sr.;\n(b) Mrs. Fraser Jr.;\n(c) Brock Fraser?\nThe jury did not answer any of the questions but returned a general verdict in favour of the respondent and assessed damages.\nSince a general verdict was given, it must be taken that all the issues of fact properly before the jury are determined in favour of the respondent. The negligence found is that of Dr. Heffelfinger and the first question to be determined is whether there was any sufficient evidence of negligence upon his part and, if there was, whether in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence the appellant is liable if damage resulted.\nIt was shown that under an agreement in writing made between Dr. Heffelfinger and the Vancouver General Hospital dated June 1, 1948, he agreed to act as junior interne, in accordance with the rules existing or which might be issued from time to time, and agreed not to practise medicine in any of its forms or branches outside the Vancouver General Hospital for the period that the contract was in force. In consideration of his services he was to be paid $25 per month and it was provided that the agreement might be cancelled by the hospital without notice, in consequence of neglect of duty, misconduct or continued failure to observe the hospital regulations. The temporary licence granted to him by the College of Physicians and Surgeons above referred to had been granted on May 31, 1948. The evidence is not clear as to the previous experience of Dr. Heffelfinger, though it appears to me a fair inference from the evidence that he had but recently graduated in medicine. That he was engaged as an interne would probably convey to medical men that this was so, but there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that this knowledge was shared either by Fraser or the respondent. It is apparently common ground that the appellant operates a public hospital at the city of Vancouver to which injured persons such as Fraser, inter alia, might obtain admittance, presumably on the footing that they are to pay for services rendered. As to this and as to whether the appellant corporation is by statute or otherwise required to receive all sick persons presenting themselves for admission, no reference was made either in the evidence or in the arguments addressed to us.\nAt the root of the matter lies the question as to the duty owed by the appellant to Fraser in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. In the absence of any direct evidence as to what took place upon his admission, there is sufficient evidence from what took place thereafter that when admitted he was taken in charge by Dr. Davies and the nurses in the emergency ward and such steps taken by them immediately as they considered necessary in view of his condition. That Dr. Davies did examine Fraser is apparent since it was he who signed the requisition for the X-ray, the form indicating that he suspected or wished to be informed with certainty as to whether there was a fracture of any of the cervical vertebrae. Upon Dr. Heffelfinger's arrival he undertook what appears to have been a most thorough and careful neurological examination of the patient. It is thus made plain that the hospital undertook to give Fraser both nursing and medical attention. The duty of the hospital in these circumstances was to exercise reasonable care in the treatment given to the patient, this involving, to the extent that such treatment consisted of medical treatment by the doctors, that they should exhibit reasonable skill. It was unfortunately the fact that the X-ray films which were taken disclosed a fracture of the second cervical vertebrae and that Dr. Heffelfinger, who on his own statement had little skill or experience in reading such films, failed to detect it. There was a skilled radiologist on call at night to whom Dr. Heffelfinger might have referred the matter and the jury may well have considered that it was a negligent act, in view of his own lack of experience in such matters, not to refer the matter to this man. For the hospital it is said that the responsibility was not that of Dr. Heffelfinger since, by the rules which governed his conduct, he was required to get in touch with the patient's own doctor and to act on his instructions and that this was done. The only evidence as to what took place between Dr. Heffelfinger and Dr. Blair is that of the former. The evidence concerning this conversation may well have been regarded by the jury as not entirely satisfactory. While the doctor said that he had advised Dr. Blair of his limited experience, they may have considered that the evidence as to the extent of this disclosure was not clear and that if Dr. Blair had been aware that, as stated by Dr. Heffelfinger in evidence, he was not qualified to express an opinion as to what the films disclosed the latter would not have agreed to the patient being discharged. I think further that, in arriving at a conclusion as to who had taken part in the decision to discharge Fraser, they may have attached importance to the emergency accident report in which Dr. Heffelfinger had said that Dr. Blair had \"agreed\" to discharge rather than he had directed the discharge. The language of this entry, plus the fact that (since it must be assumed that the jury believed the evidence of Mrs. Fraser) Dr. Heffelfinger did not merely convey to them Dr. Blair's instructions but, in answer to inquiries of both Fraser and his wife, the latter of whom was apparently reluctant to have her husband leave the hospital, he assured them that the injuries to his neck were not serious, lends some support to the view that he took an active part in the decision to discharge the patient and in his discharge. Assuming, as I do, that Dr. Heffelfinger was a recent graduate in medicine, that his experience was thus limited and that he was not competent to read the X-ray films, had he informed Fraser and his wife of these facts and, after full disclosure to Dr. Blair, simply conveyed to them the doctor's advice and instructions and acted upon them, the situation would, in my opinion, have been different. The jury may well have considered that there had not been full disclosure made to Dr. Blair of the lack of experience of Dr. Heffelfinger and that assuming to advise Fraser that he could safely leave the emergency ward and go to his home, without having obtained the opinion of a radiologist as to whether there was a fracture of the vertebra, was a failure on the part of Dr. Heffelfinger to exercise that reasonable degree of care and skill and treatment, which it was the duty of the appellant to afford to Fraser in the circumstances disclosed.\nFacts were disclosed by the evidence from which the jury might properly draw the inference of negligence on the part of Dr. Heffelfinger. The nature of the obligation which the hospital assumed towards Fraser must be inferred from the circumstances disclosed by the evidence and here the inference may properly be drawn that it was to afford both nursing and medical attention. The decision in Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital[18] , does not, in my opinion, touch the present matter and the views expressed by Kennedy L.J. must be considered in the light of the comments made upon them in this Court by Davis J. in delivering the judgment of the majority in Sisters of St. Joseph v. Fleming[19] , and of Lord Greene M.R. in Gold v. Essex County Council[20] . Dr. Heffelfinger was an employee of the appellant and if there was negligence on his part in the present matter it was, in my opinion, in the course of his employment and if damage resulted the appellant is liable (Cassidy v. Ministry of Health[21] , Denning L.J.).\nThere remains the question as to whether there was evidence from which a jury might properly draw the inference that what was done by Fraser, in reliance upon Dr. Heffelfinger's advice, caused or contributed to his death which occurred on March 14th.\nFraser had been brought to the hospital in an ambulance but left in a taxicab to go home. He was a big powerful man, 6 ft. 3 inches in height, and entering and getting out of the taxicab no doubt required him to stoop. There was evidence from which the jury might conclude that there were places in the street which would be traversed on his way home which were rough and would give the passengers a shaking-up. It was necessary for him to walk up some fifteen steps to enter the door of his home and on entering he undressed himself and lay down in bed, was given a hot drink and his head propped up on pillows. He had left the hospital at about 3 o'clock in the morning of March 9 and at 9 o'clock that morning his wife, at his request, telephoned Dr. C. S. Rennie and on his advice a hot water bottle was placed at the back of Fraser's neck. Dr. Rennie arrived at Fraser's home at about 2 o'clock, staying nearly an hour. According to Mrs. Fraser, he examined her husband but the nature of this examination is not disclosed in the evidence and Dr. Rennie was not called as a witness at the trial. When he left he apparently obtained a report on the X-ray films that had been taken during the previous night and returned shortly before eleven o'clock that evening with the plates or films taken from them and informed the respondent, and presumably her husband, that they disclosed a fracture of the second cervical vertebra and advised that Fraser return to the hospital. The hospital reports put in evidence by the plaintiff indicate that he entered the private ward pavilion at 1.15 a.m. on March 10, the attending physician being shown as Dr. C. S. Rennie and the nature of his injury being stated as fracture-dislocation cervical spine.\nIt is common ground that the cause of Fraser's death was an ileus, a paralysis of the small intestine, and resulting complications, and it is the respondent's case that the activities carried on by him between 3 o'clock on the morning of March 10 and either the time when Dr. Rennie discovered the nature of the injury or the time of Fraser's re-admission to the hospital were responsible for the development of this condition.\nIn view of the medical evidence that a paralysis of the small intestine may result from a number of causes, the burden resting upon the respondent upon this issue was a difficult one. While it was stated in argument before us that her case was that the condition was brought about by an injury to the nervous system resulting from Fraser's activities during this period, I do not think the respondent should be restricted to this. If there were in fact no injury to the autonomic nervous system but there was other evidence connecting Fraser's actions, in reliance upon Dr. Heffelfinger's advice, with its development, the respondent's claim should be sustained.\nAs has been stated, Dr. Heffelfinger gave Fraser a thorough neurological examination shortly after midnight on March 9. Dr. J. R. Naden, a highly qualified orthopaedic surgeon who was called as a witness for the appellant, referred to this as \"the examination that was so minutely carried out by Dr. Heffelfinger\" and the respondent adopts the same position and contends that this established that the shock of the accident and the fracture of the axis vertebra had caused no injury to the nervous system. That the forward dislocation of the axis resulted in a displacement of 3\/16th of an inch was disclosed by the X-ray examination and, according to Dr. Harmon who conducted the autopsy on March 15th, there could be elicited a forward displacement of the second vertebra on the third.\nIt was the contention of the respondent that pressure thus brought to bear upon the spinal cord at the site of the fracture had caused an injury to the nervous system controlling the functioning of the small intestine and this was the opinion expressed by Dr. W. N. Kemp. According to him, Fraser should not have been permitted to move about or to leave the emergency ward; he considered that he should have been put to bed and extension applied for the purpose of reducing the fracture, saying that the important thing in such cases was to prevent flexion of the neck and upper spine \"thus preventing further damage or any damage to the cord.\" Dr. Kemp said that an ileus resulted from some interruption in the function of the parasympathetic nervous system and that in the majority of the cases which he had heard of or seen they had been functional, there having been \"some imbalance in the function of the parasympathetic system without any anatomical destruction of the nerves.\" While an ileus, functional in origin, was, in his opinion, curable, one caused by injury to the nerves in the cervical region was not \"because spinal nerves like nerves in the brain once they are destroyed never recover.\" Answering a hypothetical question propounded by counsel for the respondent, which assumed that the examination of the patient at the emergency ward had been very carefully and thoroughly done and showed no sign of nerve injury and that thereafter the injured person had followed the course which had in fact been pursued by Fraser between the time of his leaving the emergency ward and his re-entry into the hospital and which asked his opinion as to the cause of death, Dr. Kemp said that it was almost a certainty that at some stage of the various activities enumerated:\nthe pressure of the dislocation would be such that the softening which is reported in the cord and the edema, indicating as they do destruction of the nerve tissue, assuming all these to be correct \u2026 I would say there is a very direct connection between the resulting paralytic ileus and all these various activities subsequent to leaving the hospital.\nIn answer to a further question he said that, in his opinion, the paralytic ileus:\nwas directly due to injury suffered by the nerve filaments, probably largely parasympathetic, located in the cord at the cervical area.\nand that:\nit would be reasonable to assume that the symptoms, not being present when he was discharged from the hospital, it must have occurred subsequent to his departure from the hospital.\nThe latter answer clearly shows that, according to the witness, if there had been any injury to the nerves or nervous system such as he described at the time Fraser was examined by Dr. Heffelfinger the examination would have disclosed it. The question propounded to Dr. Kemp was incomplete since a most relevant fact, of which the doctor was unaware, was omitted. At some time during the morning of March 10, presumably after Fraser had been readmitted to the hospital, Dr. Rennie on his behalf retained the services of Dr. W. H. Fahrni, an orthopaedic surgeon who had carried out a thorough neurological examination of Fraser that day and found \"no sign of any neurological involvement\" and who said that while he examined him thereafter, at least once a day, there was never any evidence of any nerve injury. The following passage from the cross-examination of Dr. Kemp deals with this aspect of the case:\nQ. Now, when he came back to the hospital on the 10th and was attended by Dr. Rennie and Dr. Fahrni, the ordinary routine thing for a specialist like Dr. Fahrni, to do, is to again check his nervous system? A. I think so, especially with a neck injury, with this history.\nQ. And you had no information when you gave your answer to Mr. Murphy's hypothetical question what the result of that examination was? A. Except I believe it was read there was a meterism and distension in the man's abdomen.\nQ. Speak up. A. It was read to me in evidence that the man on re-entering the hospital had abdominal distension, and what is known as meterism, or gas, which correctly means a swelling which would indicate an early ileus.\nQ. What you say of course appears in the medical chart. There was some distension of his abdomen. A. Yes, sir.\nQ. I think it was the first day he got back to the hospital. I am not referring to that at all. Just leave that out. I am referring to the neurological examination which Dr. Fahrni would make when he was called in on the case. A. I have no knowledge of Dr. Fahrni's examination.\nQ. And you had no knowledge of the result of that, if he made one, when you gave that answer yesterday? A. No, unless it was a part of what was read.\nQ. And that is, of course, very important? A. Oh, yes, definitely.\nand again, after reference was made to the fact that Dr. Fahrni was an orthopaedic specialist and Dr. Kemp having said that \"they are not known for their knowledge of the nervous system\", the following appears :\nQ. They have the knowledge of how to make a neurological examination? A. Apparently. It is just about the equivalent of what a general practitioner has.\nQ. You agree that Dr. Heffelfinger who was then an interne made the proper one? A. According to this record.\nQ. And you would at least give an experienced orthopaedic surgeon credit for having a similar knowledge? A. Oh yes, at least.\nQ. And you agree then that the conclusion which Dr. Fahrni would draw from the examination when he was attending would be highly important? A. Oh, definitely. Later, having been asked in the course of cross-examination about Fraser's activities, he said that:\nScientifically they could result in a further increase of the dislocation, eventually leading to pressure on the cord.\nand when asked if the activities had done that, Dr. Kemp said that they must have. Dr. Kemp was not re-examined, the respondent's case being closed at the termination of this cross-examination. What he would have answered to an hypothetical question, in which the facts upon which his opinion was to be based included the all important one that no trace of injury to the nervous system could be found on March 10, when Dr. Fahrni examined Fraser, is unknown.\nThere was no other evidence given on behalf of the respondent directed to sustain the contention that the development of the ileus was attributable to Fraser's activities during the period mentioned. It was part of the assumed statement of facts contained in the hypothetical question answered by Dr. Kemp that the ileus had already commenced to develop when Fraser was readmitted to the hospital in the early morning of March 10. The respondent had sought to establish this fact by introducing into the evidence as part of her case the nurse's notes and the history sheet prepared by the employees of the hospital. The nurse's notes consist of entries apparently made at the time to record the course of the illness and show the time of admission as being 1.15 a.m. on March 10, at which time the patient was suffering from a pain in the back of the neck extending to the level of the shoulders. Dr. Rennie is shown to have visited Fraser at 1.30 a.m. and again at 10 a.m. At 12.30 p.m. an entry shows that extension was applied to the neck by Dr. Fahrni and that at this time Fraser was complaining of pain in his back and hips. There is no entry in the nurse's notes of March 10 of there being any distension of the abdomen which, according to medical evidence, might indicate the commencement of an ileus, the first entry of this being at 2 a.m. on March 11. No nurse was called to give evidence as to this. The hospital record further included a history sheet, apparently prepared by Dr. W. G. Walker. This document is not dated nor the time of day when it was made known. Since, however, the first entry says that the patient was involved in a traffic accident \"today\", it may perhaps be inferred that Dr. Walker compiled this document on the day that Fraser was readmitted to the hospital. The sheet contains an entry to the effect that the abdomen was very extended. Dr. Walker, who could have cleared up the matter, was not called. Dr. Fahrni, however, who apparently first saw the patient at 12.30 p.m. on March 10, as indicated in the nurse's notes says that there was some distension at that time and that he regarded this as a symptom of an ileus. There is thus no evidence of distension at the time, some eleven hours earlier, when Fraser entered the hospital. Indeed, the absence of any mention of the fact in the nurse's notes is some evidence, however slight, that the contrary was the case.\nThe question as to what had brought about the paralysis of the small intestine was not one which, in the circumstances of this case, could be dealt with by a jury without the assistance of medical opinion. In my view, the opinion of Dr. Kemp based upon an incomplete, and in one part inaccurate, statement of the facts was valueless. On this aspect of the case, the respondent's action must fail unless sufficient support can be found in other evidence. The evidence for the appellant on this issue was that of Dr. Fahrni and of Dr. J. R. Naden, both practising in Vancouver and specializing in orthopaedic surgery. Their evidence made it apparent that the condition of ileus might be produced in a variety of manners and that at times it is impossible to diagnose the cause. Dr. Fahrni gave no evidence as to what information, if any, he obtained from Dr. Rennie as to Fraser's symptoms at 2 o'clock on March 9 when the latter had examined him. He had met Dr. Rennie at the hospital and had seen the X-ray plates taken on the requisition of Dr. Davies and had Fraser immobilized on his back in bed, in the usual manner adopted in treating an injury of the nature disclosed, and applied head traction to reduce the fracture. It was important, in his opinion, to ascertain whether the plaintiff had suffered any damage to the spinal cord and he thereupon conducted the neurological examination already referred to. According to him, there are a great many causes for an ileus: some may occur for no obvious reason but may, as he expressed it, develop spontaneously, though this is rare. The condition, he said, may be produced by a direct irritation of the nerves to the bowels, which would be obvious on examination, and that any severe injury may bring on an ileus or any very severe psychic upset. Further he said that the condition was one which was very poorly understood and that:\nAs yet it is not known the exact mechanism of the onset of an ileus, except that the nerves to the bowel are obviously interrupted, but there are many times when they are definitely not interrupted when an ileus does arise.\nand that simply lying in an unaccustomed position on one's back might cause an ileus. While saying in cross-examination that in the case of a fracture such as this it was a very dangerous thing to send Fraser home from the emergency ward, as has been done, because it might have resulted in injury to the spinal cord, he could find no evidence of any such injury or that driving to his home from the hospital had caused any harm. Asked if his reason for wishing to reduce the fracture was to prevent pressure on the spinal cord, he said that there was no such pressure on the cord or evidence of injury to the cord. Then asked as to what had caused the ileus, he said he did not know. Later, in his cross-examination, he was asked if he could suggest some contributory factors which might have produced the condition and after he had said that he could not say that the fracture dislocation of the axis did not cause it, the cross-examiner abandoned the subject and it was not thereafter revived.\nDr. J. R. Naden, the chief of the orthopaedic section of the Vancouver General Hospital since 1936, who had been in court and heard both Dr. Fahrni's and Dr. Heffelfinger's description of the neurological examinations that they had made, was of the view that they showed that there was no evidence of injury to the spinal cord or to the nervous system in any way, and further that Dr. Harmon's evidence as to his finding at the autopsy did not disclose any damage to the spinal cord. Dr. Naden said that an ileus might develop from a number of causes, that he had seen the condition develop in patients who had been put to bed suffering merely from a pain in the back, that the most common cause was an infection such as peritonitis, that the condition developed also at times from a stomach operation and that the \"mechanism of paralytic ileus is not completely known.\" The condition, he said, could be brought about by an injury to the spinal cord or to the autonomic nervous system but the existence of such injury could be demonstrated by a neurological examination such as that conducted by Dr. Fahrni, who had found no evidence of injury to the spinal cord or the sympathetic nervous system or the parasympathetic nervous system in relation to the spinal cord. Dr. Naden agreed with Dr. Fahrni that the evidence given by the autopsist did not disclose any injury to the spinal cord. He further was of the opinion that Fraser's activities after leaving the emergency ward had no connection with the development of the ileus.\nNo rebuttal evidence was tendered by the respondent and thus the evidence of Drs. Fahrni and Naden as to the variety of causes which might produce an ileus is unchallenged. The question as to whether there was any evidence of injury to the nervous system at the time Dr. Rennie took charge and at the time of Fraser's re-entry into the hospital, which might have produced the condition, was of the most vital importance to the respondent's case. It is true that apparently Dr. Fahrni's first neurological examination of Fraser was some eleven hours after his readmission to the hospital. This makes available to the respondent the argument that his findings do not, of necessity, establish that there was not some evidence of injury or disturbance of the nervous system which might bring about the paralysis apparent at 1.15 that morning and which was not evident at 12.30 p.m. As to this, Fraser's own physician, Dr. Rennie, and Dr. Walker, if in fact he examined Fraser shortly after his admission, might have given some evidence but neither were called. Dr. Fahrni was Fraser's doctor, so that whatever was known to him was available to the respondent, including the fact that at 12.30 p.m. on March 10 no evidence of any nervous injury was detected by him and, if the respondent proposed to contend that his condition was different several hours earlier, I think the onus of establishing that fact lay upon her.\nNo evidence was given as to the exact manner in which Fraser sustained the injuries that brought him to the emergency ward of the hospital, other than that he had been involved in an automobile accident. The medical evidence shows that such a fracture of the second cervical vertebra might be caused in a motor accident by the vehicle in which a person was travelling being brought to a sudden and violent stop. While Dr. Rennie was consulted six hours after Fraser left the hospital and examined him five hours later and might thus be charged with the responsibility for his treatment thereafter, it is not unfair to the appellant to deal with this aspect of the case upon the basis that if the ileus resulted, as the respondent contends, from Fraser's activities between 3 a.m. on the morning of March 9 and 1.15 a.m. on the following morning, the cause was the negligence complained of. Dealing with the matter on this footing, there was, in my opinion, no evidence from which the jury might properly draw the inference that the ileus resulted from anything done by or on behalf of Fraser, in reliance upon Dr. Heffelfinger's advice. Dr. Kemp's theory as to the cause of the development of the ileus was based upon a misconception of the facts and in the belief that the shaking-up which Fraser would receive in driving home in the taxicab, the forward flexion of his cervical spine in getting into and out of the taxicab and his movements after he arrived home and while there until he re-entered the hospital, had caused an injury to his nervous system and that such injury had not existed when he left the emergency ward. That any such injury would have been disclosed by the examination conducted by Dr. Fahrni follows, of necessity, from Dr. Kemp's evidence and was the considered opinion of both Dr. Fahrni and Dr. Naden, and there is no other evidence on the matter. Other than that these activities would, in his opinion, bring about an injury to the nerves or nervous system, Dr. Kemp did not hazard any opinion as to what might have caused the ileus. On the other hand, Dr. Fahrni, who was Fraser's own doctor, and Dr. Naden were of the opinion that what was done by Fraser in the period mentioned had nothing to do with the development of the condition. The case is thus left in this position that the undisputed evidence is that the ileus might have been developed from a variety of causes, including the injury sustained at the time of the accident, the shock Fraser then suffered, or from some other unknown cause. That it was caused by an injury to the nervous system during the period in question is disproved by the evidence. That damage resulted from what the jury evidently considered to have been a negligent act on the part of Dr. Heffelfinger was a fact which the respondent was required to prove. This does not mean, to adopt the language of Earl Loreburn, L.C. in Richard Evans and Company v. Astley[22] , that she must \"demonstrate her case\" and, if the more probable conclusion is that for which she contends and there is anything pointing to it, there was evidence for the jury to act upon. I do not think this statement was intended to differ with what had been said by Willes, J. in Ryder v. Wombwell[23] , where, delivering the judgment of a court which included Byles, Blackburn, Montague Smith and Lush, JJ., he quoted with approval what was said by Williams, J. in Toomey v. London and Brighton Railway Company[24] :\nIt is not enough to say that there was some evidence\u2026 A scintilla of evidence\u2026 clearly would not justify the judge in leaving the case to the jury. There must be evidence on which they might reasonably and properly conclude that there was negligence.\nIn the present matter the jury might, if they saw fit, reject the opinions of Dr. Fahrni and of Dr. Naden, that what occurred during the interval in question had nothing to do with the development of the ileus, and it is to be assumed that they did so. There was, in my opinion, a complete absence of any other evidence from which they might reasonably and properly draw a conclusion as to whether the cause was something done in reliance upon Dr. Heffelfinger's advice, or in consequence of his failure to diagnose the true nature of the injury, or that it was the physical injury sustained in the collision or the resulting shock or some other reason unknown. If it were to be said that from the fact that they rendered a general verdict it is to be taken that the jury found, in the face of all the evidence, that some injury to the nervous system did result during the interval in question, such a verdict would, in my opinion, be perverse and should be set aside.\nI would allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout if they are demanded. CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brothers Rand and Kellock that there was evidence in this case on which the jury might properly find that there was negligence on the part of the appellant in connection with the discharge of the deceased from the emergency ward and that such negligence caused the death of the deceased and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014I agree with my brothers Rand and Kellock that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was before the jury material on which they could, acting judicially, find that the death of Gordon Arthur Fraser resulted from an unwarranted discharge of this patient from the hospital consequential (a) to a negligence of Dr. H. to read in the X-ray plates\u2014or, if unqualified in the matter, to call for the assistance of the hospital's available expert to do so\u2014the fracture of the axis which, admittedly suspected by him, was indicated in the X-ray films, and (b) to a failure on his part to adequately inform the family physician as to the real situation with respect to the condition of the patient as well as with respect to his capacity to appreciate it, a failure which, in the result, lead the family physician to \"agree\" to the discharge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Wain-Town, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 377\nDate: 1952-06-16\nThe Minister Of National Revenue Appellant;\nand\nWain-Own Gas and Oil Company Limited Respondent\n1952: February 21, 22; 1952: June 16.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Income\u2014Sale of franchise to supply natural gas\u2014Price fixed on percentage of future gross sales of gas\u2014Payments described as royalties\u2014Whether payments are income within s. 3(1) (f) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1937, c. 97.\nThe respondent company assigned to another company its franchise to supply the consumers in a certain municipality with natural gas. The rights conferred by the franchise were granted for a period of ten years from 1938 with the option of renewal, indefinitely, for further periods of like duration. The consideration for the assignment was that the respondent was to be paid monthly \"by way of royalty\" a percentage of the gross sales of gas. The Minister assessed these monthly payments as taxable income for the years 1944 and 1945 under s. 3(1) (f) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 and amendments. The assessment was set aside by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and the assessment restored since the payments were income within s. 3(1) (f) of the Income War Tax Act.\nHeld: In a business sense in Canada, the word \"royalty\" covers the payments made here and was so looked upon by the respondent when making its tax returns. Even if they were not received as royalties, they fall within the expression \"other like periodical receipts\". They depend upon the use of the franchise (which is property). It is not the production of natural gas upon which depend the payments as it is only under the powers conferred by the franchise that natural gas may be supplied and conducted to the consumers thereof. Finally, receipts, so dependent, are income by virtue of s. 3(1) (f), even though they are payable on account either of the use or sale of the franchise.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting) : In its ordinary meaning, the word \"royalty\" does not describe, or extend to, a payment such as was stipulated for in this case, where the payment is made as part of the purchase price of the outright sale of personal property transferred without reservation. As the words \"other like periodical receipts\" refer to those of an income or revenue, as distinguished from a capital nature, they do not cover these payments, which were instalments on account of the purchase price of the franchise and of a capital nature such as were dealt with in Wilder v. Minister of National Revenue [1952] 1 S.C.R. 123. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Angers J., reversing the decision of the Minister of National Revenue and holding that the payments stipulated in the agreement were not taxable income.\nJ. R. Tolmie and F. J. Cross for the appellant. The receipts here in question fall within the words of subparagraph (f) and are \"annual profits or gains from any other source\" within subsection (1) of section 3. They are \"rents, royalties, annuities or other like periodical receipts\". They depend upon the production or use of any real or personal property. The whole of the receipts are profit or gain by definition whether or not they may be said to represent, in whole or in part, a return of capital.\nThe receipts are income receipts and were properly included in the computation of the respondent's annual net profit or gain in the two years in question. To say that these receipts are part of the consideration for the transfer of property is not conclusive as to their character as capital or income receipts. They were not instalments of purchase price but income receipts. The respondent's capital, namely, its franchise and exclusive marketing contract, entirely disappeared and in its place it was to receive an income calculated as a percentage of the gross selling price of gas sold under the franchise. Whether they are to be treated as capital or income is to be determined upon a careful analysis of the circumstances in each particular case. The circumstances in this case taken together clearly indicate that the respondent's capital simply disappeared and substituted for it was an income dependent upon the volume of business conducted in the exclusive market. There is no evidence that any part of the sums received by the respondent under the agreement represented a return to it of its capital.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. for the respondent. The transaction between the respondent and the Franco was a capital transaction. It was a sale by the respondent of a capital asset, the purchase price being payable in instalments, which were capital receipts in the hands of the respondent. The payments are not included in the terms \"rents, royalties, annuities or other like periodical receipts\" since there is no reversionary interest left in the respondent.\nThe payments do not depend upon the use or production of the franchise but depend upon the amount of gas sold by Franco, and the respondent is in no way, directly or indirectly, an owner of said gas.\nThe franchise is not the kind or type of real or personal property specified and enumerated in the section.\nThe concluding portion of the sub-paragraph has therefore no application.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Taschereau, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014We are called upon to decide whether the respondent, Wain-Town Gas and Oil Company, Limited, is liable to assessment for income tax and excess profits tax in the years 1944 and 1945, and the particular question is whether an item of $1,965.02 should be included in the respondent's revenue receipts for 1944 as \"net royalties\" and an item of $4,181.45 should be included in its revenue receipts for the year 1945 as \"royalties and sales\". These items were in fact so inserted under those names by the respondent in its tax returns for the respective years but because of certain claimed expenditures a loss was shown. When these expenditures were disallowed by the Department, a profit appeared in each year, upon which the assessments in question were made, and the respondent thereupon appealed to the Minister\u2014not with respect to the disallowed expenditures but with reference to the \"net royalties\" and \"royalties and sales\".\nThese moneys were received by the respondent from Franco Public Service Limited in pursuance of an assignment dated January 6, 1940, from the respondent to Franco of a certain franchise. This franchise had been secured by the respondent from the Town of Vermilion in 1938 for the purpose of supplying and conducting natural gas to consumers in the municipality. It conferred upon the respondent the right to put down, repair, etc., and operate gas lines and related structures and equipment in the town's streets, squares, etc., and other public places, and also the exclusive right to sell natural gas within the town limits. These rights were granted for a period of ten years with the option of renewal for a further period of ten years and a similar option at the expiration of each succeeding ten year period. Provision was made whereby the town could under certain conditions and at the end of any ten year period purchase the respondent's rights under the agreement and its property used in connection therewith. The respondent undertook to continue drilling a well, which at the time of the granting of the franchise was in process of drilling, and to drill other wells as required to provide and maintain a suitable supply of gas for the town so long as such operations were economically sound. In the event of the respondent failing to comply with its covenants, or in the event of its failing to secure a suitable supply of natural gas within twelve months of the date the franchise became operative and binding on the parties, the town might, by written notice, require the Company to remedy such default or secure such suitable supply of natural gas, and upon the respondent's failure to remedy such default or secure such a suitable supply of natural gas within six months of the date of service of such notice, the town might by resolution of its council terminate the contract.\nThe respondent drilled only one well, failed to obtain a supply of natural gas and was without funds to continue further drilling operations. So far as appears, no gas lines or other structures were put down by the respondent. It was under these circumstances that by the assignment of January 6, 1940, the respondent, with the consent of the town, assigned the franchise agreement to Franco. By this assignment, Franco covenanted to carry out the terms of the franchise agreement and to indemnify and save harmless the respondent from all liability for breach, non-performance or misfeasance in respect of any of the provisions thereof as against the town or otherwise. Paragraphs 4 and 5 provide:\u2014\n4. In consideration of this assignment. Franco doth hereby covenant and agree with Wain-Town to pay to Wain-Town by way of royalty, from the proceeds of all sales of natural gas under the said franchise, the following percentages of the actual gross sales of gas reckoned at consumers' prices, less consumers' discounts :\n(a) During the first three years, six and a quarter per cent (6\u00bc%) ;\n(b) During the next 7 years, eight and one-third per cent (8\u2153%) ; (c) Thereafter during the currency of this agreement, and of the said franchise twelve and one-half per cent (12\u00bd%).\n5. It is further agreed that the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) All royalties shall be deposited to the credit of Wain-Town in the Vermilion Branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce or in such other institution as Wain-Town may designate from time to time not later than the 15th of month covering sales for the preceding month.\n(b) An authorized representative of Wain-Town shall be permitted to inspect the books, records, meters, etc., pertaining to the sale of gas.\n(c) In the event of the town exercising its right to purchase the gas utility during or at the end of either the ten (10) year term of the franchise or during or at the end of the first renewal period of ten (10) years then in such event Franco covenants and agrees to pay to Wain-Town twenty-five per cent (25%) of the net proceeds of such sale; such net proceeds to be computed after all debts of Franco have been paid.\nIn pursuance of paragraph 4, the above mentioned sums of $1,965.02 and $4,181.45 were paid by Franco to the respondent in 1944 and 1945 respectively. The appellant claims that these payments fall within clause (f) of subsection 1 of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act as amended down to and including the year 1945. Speaking generally, it is undoubted that Parliament intended to tax under the Act income as distinct from capital: Wilder v. Minister of National Revenue 2, a decision of this Court under section 3(1) (b) as it stood before amendment in 1945. However, it is clear that Parliament may also provide that receipts, part or all of which might ordinarily be termed capital, shall be treated as income for the purposes of the Act. Hence it is that after stating what income means, Parliament has enacted, by subsection 1, that it shall include certain things \"and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n(f) rents, royalties, annuities or other like periodical receipts which depend upon the production or use of any real or personal property, notwithstanding that the same are payable on account of the use or sale of any such property;\nClause (f) was enacted for the first time by section 1 of chapter 55 of the 1934 statutes as a result of the decision in Minister of National Revenue v. Spooner 3, affirming (1931) S.C.R. 399. The first point to be determined is whether the moneys received by the respondent are \"royalties\" within the meaning of this clause. The word does not bear the original meaning ascribed to it as rights belonging to the Crown jure coronae. As pointed out in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer 4 in the Judicial Committee and in this Court 5, it has a special sense when used in mining grants or licences signifying that part of the reddendum which is variable and depends upon the quantity of minerals gotten. It is a well-known term in connection with patents and copyrights. In a business sense in Canada, it covers the payments which were to be, and were, paid monthly by way of percentages of the actual gross sales (to quote paragraph 4 of the assignment), \"of natural gas under the said franchise\". It is settled by authority both here and in England that the appearance of the word \"royalties\" in the assignment does not necessarily dispose of the matter but, to quote Finlay J. in British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue 6, \"the fact that people who, after all, know all about it, choose in their agreement to refer to these annual sums * * * as \"royalties\", is a matter not to be entirely neglected.\" Furthermore, the word is used in the respondent's tax returns for each of the years 1944 and 1945, to describe the moneys received by it from Franco. I quite agree that this is not decisive but, that circumstance added to the first, are at least evidence of the manner in which, in a business sense, the word is looked upon in this country. A particularly useful judgment is that of the High Court of Australia in McCauley v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation 7, where it is pointed out that in an agreement drawn in England the term \"royalties\" has been used to describe payments for removing furnace slag from land (Shingler v. P. Williams and Sons 8) and in an agreement drawn in New Zealand to describe payments for flax cut: Akers v. Commissioner of Taxes 9.\nFinally, even if the payments were not received as royalties, they fall within the expression \"other like periodical receipts\". They are at least similar to percentages \"as on output, paid to the owner of an article, esp. a machine, by one who hires the use of it\": Webster's New International Dictionary sub nom \"royalties\".\nThese receipts depend upon the use of the franchise. In Natural Gas and Fuel Co. of Hamilton v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. 10, Lord Macmillan, speaking for the Judicial Committee, points out that the by-law of the Town of Barton and the relative agreement there in question conferred what was correctly designated as a \"franchise\", and that in Canadian local government law the term is not used with the technical signification which it possessed in other connections. Here, as there, it is employed so as to include such rights and privileges as were conferred by the original agreement between the respondent and the town. That such a body of rights is real or personal property does not admit of doubt, and the moneys received by the respondent from Franco were dependent upon the use of that franchise. It is not the production of natural gas upon which depend the payments by Franco to the respondent as it is only under the powers conferred by the franchise that natural gas may be supplied and conducted to the consumers thereof. By virtue of the concluding part of clause (f), the receipts, so dependent, are income even though they are payable on account either of the use or sale of the franchise.\nIt is not without importance to note the changes that were made in 1945 in clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 3 of the Act dealing with contractual annuities as a result of the Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation of Annuities and Family Corporations. Clause (f) remains intact and perhaps it may be difficult to find a basis for any suggested change to cover a case like the present when one bears in mind that no total sum was fixed for the sale of the franchise by the respondent to Franco and that provision was made by paragraph 5 of the assignment for the contingency of the town exercising its right to purchase during or at the end of the first or second ten year terms\u2014 whereupon Franco was to pay the respondent twenty-five percentum of the net profits of such sale. It has not been overlooked that even if the town should so exercise its right to purchase, the respondent had disposed of part of its property (the franchise) for the intervening period just as Miss Nethersole had disposed of a portion of her copyright in Nethersole v. Withers 11. However, in that case the claim of the Inspector of Taxes was that, under Case VI of Schedule D of the English Act, a certain amount received by Miss Nethersole was \"annual profits or gains not falling under any of the foregoing cases and not charged by virtue of any other schedule.\" It was held by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords that the payment was not an annual profit or gain.\nThe determination of this appeal depends upon the proper construction of clause (f) of subsection 1 of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act and I have been unable to secure any assistance from the Nethersole case or any of the other English cases cited by counsel on either side. They must be read with care and always bearing in mind the different statutory enactments with which they were concerned.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court below and the assessments of the Minister restored.\nRand J.:\u2014By the terms of an agreement dated September 19, 1938 between the Gas Company respondent and the town of Vermilion, the latter granted to the company an exclusive franchise to supply the town and its inhabitants with natural gas, together with all necessary powers to lay pipe lines under the streets and other public ways or places and otherwise to perform the public service undertaken. The franchise was to continue for ten years with a right of renewal, indefinitely, for further terms of like duration. The Gas Company agreed to do certain work of drilling wells for the gas, and in the event of default the town was authorized to take action looking to the termination of the contract.\nThe company was not successful in its drilling, and having exhausted its funds entered into an agreement dated January 6, 1940 with Franco Public Service Limited, by which, with the consent of the town, it transferred to the Service Company the franchise with all rights and powers annexed to it. The Service Company covenanted to pay to the Gas Company:\u2014\nBy way of royalty, from the proceeds of all sales of natural gas under the said franchise, the following percentages of the actual gross sales of gas reckoned at consumers' prices, less consumers' discounts:\n(a) ) During the first three years, six and a quarter per cent (6\u00bc%) ;\n(b) During the next 7 years, eight and one-third per cent (8\u2153%) ;\n(c) Thereafter during the currency of this agreement, and of the said franchise twelve and one-half per cent (12\u00bd%).\nThe royalties were to be deposited to the credit of the Gas Company in one of the banks in the town \"not later than the 15th of month covering sales for the preceding month\". In the event, within the first two periods of the franchise, of the town exercising its right to purchase under the original contract, the Service Company was to pay to the Gas Company 25 per cent of the proceeds after all the debts of the Service Company had been paid.\nThe narrow question is whether these monthly payments are income for the purposes of the Income War Tax Act, and the clause of the latter under which the Crown supports its contention that they are is sec. 3(1) (f) which reads:\u2014\n(f) rents, royalties, annuities or other like periodical receipts which depend upon the production or use of any real or personal property, notwithstanding that the same are payable on account of the use or sale of any such property;\nThe word \"royalty\" in the agreement is not, of course, controlling, but it does bear upon the propriety of the use of the word, in the minds of business men, to describe the type of payment involved. The statutory language, dealing with the results of accounting processes determining economic gain in business, must, in large degree, use the vocabulary employed in them; and the meaning of the word as it appears in the statute must have regard to its general acceptation in the course of property and business transactions.\nNow a rent is, primarily, something reserved, in some form or other, and in a conceptual sense, from property or property interest transferred from one person to another. The word \"royalties\" is best known, perhaps, as a term to express an interest in the nature generally of future payments upon a grant or lease of mines, such as gold, coal, petroleum or gas rights; and it makes no real difference in substance or as to the nature of the payments whether they arise through a \"reservation\", strictly so-called, or a covenant.\nThe language of para. (f) seems to be directly related to that signification of the term, and I should take it to be beyond serious doubt that prima facie the payments here come within the expression \"royalties * * * or other like periodical receipts\". The query then is whether they \"depend upon the production or use\" of any property. Purists in language might object to the word \"use\" in relation to carrying on a franchise ; the franchise is perhaps more properly said to be \"exercised\" than \"used\". But the words \"production or use\" are intended to cover a great many particulars of a general class of dealings with property, and to \"use\" a franchise would not at all be beyond the range of common parlance. I should say, then, that the word \"use\" is appropriate to the exercise of such a franchise; and that a franchise is personal property was not challenged.\nAre the payments, then, constituting as they do part of the consideration for the sale of the franchise, to be excluded from tax as being capital in their nature? In Wilder v. The Minister 12, a decision of this Court, it was held that an annuity of $1,000 a month for the life of the annuitant, which was part of the price for the transfer of a business from an individual to a company, was of a capital nature and not within the definition of \"income\" in sec. 3(1) (b); but under para. (f) of the section that ground seems to be expressly met by the language \"notwithstanding that the same are payable on account of the use or sale of any such property\". Now, the property is the franchise; the royalty is payable on account of the sale of it ; and the payment depends upon its exercise. The paragraph seems to me to be satisfied completely by the terms of the transaction, and I must hold the respondent to come within it.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and direct judgment for the amount claimed with costs in both Courts. Locke J. (dissenting) :\u2014By an agreement dated September 19,1938, the Town of Vermilion granted to the respondent, inter alia, the right to enter upon the streets of the town and install gas pipe lines and related structures and equipment for the supply of natural gas to inhabitants on terms defined by that instrument. Rights of the nature granted to the respondent are referred to as a \"special franchise\" in section 291 of the Town and Village Act, c. 150, R.S.A. 1942, and by section 292 the council was empowered to grant such rights with the approval of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners for any period not in excess of twenty years.\nBy the agreement the town granted the exclusive right to supply natural gas to its inhabitants to the respondent for a period of ten years from the date of the agreement, and by a further clause it was provided that at the expiration of that term the company might have the option of renewing:\u2014\nthe said exclusive franchise and its contract for a further period of ten years and a similar option at the expiration of each succeeding ten-year period for which the said contract and franchise may be renewed.\nprovided that such renewals should be subject to such alterations as might be agreed upon between the parties, and that if either party refused to renew or if the parties failed to agree as to the conditions of such renewal:\u2014\nthen the Company may refer the matters in dispute to the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners for settlement and the order of such Board shall be final and binding on both parties hereto.\nA further term provided that if the company failed to refer any such matter to the Board within thirty days after a written request by the town to do so, the town council might purchase the company's rights under the contract and in all apparatus and property used for the purposes thereof on such terms as might be agreed upon or, failing agreement, as might be fixed by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners.\nBy an order dated January 24, 1941, the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, a body constituted under the Public Utilities Act (c. 28, R.S.A. 1942), which referred to the agreement of September 19, 1938, as granting exclusive privileges for a period of ten years to the respondent, approved the agreement. By an agreement in writing dated January 6, 1940, to which the Town of Vermilion was a party, the Wain-Town Company assigned the agreement of September 19, 1938, to Franco Public Service Limited, the latter company assuming the obligations of the respondent to the town contained in that agreement and the town joining for the purpose of evidencing its consent to the transaction. The consideration for the assignment was stated in the following language:\u2014\nIn consideration of this assignment Franco doth hereby covenant and agree with Wain-Town to pay to Wain-Town by way of royalty, from the proceeds of all sales of natural gas under the said franchise, the following percentages of the actual gross sales of gas reckoned at consumers' prices, less consumers' discounts:\n(a) During the first three years six and a quarter per cent (6\u00bc%)\n(b) During the next 7 years, eight and one third per cent (81\/3%)\n(c) Thereafter during the currency of this agreement, and of the said franchise twelve and one-half per cent (12\u00bd%) .)\nA further term provided that in the event of the town exercising its right to purchase the gas utility during or at the end of either the ten year term of the franchise or during or at the end of the first renewal period of ten years the Franco Company would pay to Wain-Town twenty-five per cent of the net proceeds of such sale.\nThe matter to be determined is as to whether amounts received by the respondent from the Franco Company during the taxation years 1944 and 1945 of the nature referred to as royalties in the agreement of January 6, 1940 were taxable income of the respondent during these years. In a carefully considered judgment, by which the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming assessments made upon the respondent was set aside, Mr. Justice Angers 13 has found that these receipts were not taxable. The question turns upon the interpretation to be placed upon paragraph (f) of subsection 1 of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act, c. 97, R.S.C. 1927, and the amendments to that Act applicable to these taxation periods. The definition of taxable income, in so far as it affects this matter, as contained in subsection 1 of section 3 of the Act, reads:\nFor the purposes of this Act \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture, or business, as the case may be, whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere.\nand is stated to include, inter alia:\u2014\n(f) rents, royalties, annuities or other like periodical receipts which depend upon the production or use of any real or personal property, notwithstanding that the same are payable on account of the use or sale of any such property.\nThe evidence discloses that the Wain-Town Company did not discover natural gas on its own properties or construct pipe lines or install the apparatus required for the supply of gas to the town and what was conveyed to the Franco Company was simply the rights of the company under the agreement which granted the franchise. Apparently the Franco Company proceeded with the necessary installations and supplies the Town of Vermilion with natural gas acquired by it from the wells of certain companies with which it is associated. For the Crown it is said that within the language of paragraph (f) the payments made to the respondent company are either royalties or other like periodical receipts which depend upon the production or use of personal property, that is, the franchise granted by the town to Wain-Town. For the respondent it is contended that the payments are simply instalments of the purchase price of the sale of a capital asset, that is, of the incorporeal hereditament described in the statute as a special franchise.\nParagraph (f) of subsection 1 of section 3 was introduced into the Income War Tax Act by section 1 of c. 55 of the Statutes of 1934. It appears to be common ground that this amendment was made in consequence of the decisions of this Court and of the Judicial Committee in Minister of National Revenue v. Spooner 14. In that case a landowner had sold a percel of land in Alberta to a company engaged in drilling for oil for the consideration of a sum in cash, certain fully paid shares of the company and the delivery of ten per cent of the petroleum, natural gas and oil which might be produced from the said lands, which was referred to in the agreement of sale as a royalty reserved to the vendor. Affirming the decision in this Court, it was held that the so-called royalties were not taxable income.\nParagraph (f) of subsection 1 does not reproduce the terms of any of the various Income Tax Acts in England or of the rules passed under the authority of any such Act and little help in its interpretation is to be found in any of the English decisions. In the present matter the franchise was sold outright, without any reservation, and thus the sale was of a different nature from that considered in Spooner's case. While the agreement of January 6, 1940 referred to the percentages of the actual gross sales of gas as royalties, this, while a matter to be considered, is not decisive nor relieves us of the necessity of determining what was the real nature of the transactions. The expression \"royalties\" in the paragraph, in the absence of a statutory definition, is to be assigned its ordinary and natural meaning. The word appears in section 109 of the British North America Act, where lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the time of Union were reserved to them. It is not, however, in the sense of a royal prerogative or right that the word is used in the Income Tax Act, but rather in the sense that the word is commonly used in business transactions to describe sums paid for the right to use a patent or copyright, or to exercise some like incorporeal right, or some payment to be made from the production from property the ownership of which remains vested in the grantor. In my opinion, the word in its ordinary meaning does not describe, or extend to, a payment such as was stipulated for in the agreement between the parties in this matter, where the payment is made as part of the purchase price of the outright sale of personal property transferred without reservation to the Franco Company.\nBy the terms of the agreement, the payments to which the Wain-Town Company should become entitled were to be paid monthly to its credit in the Vermilion Branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce covering sales of gas in the preceding month and are clearly not of the nature of annuities. The remaining question is, therefore, whether they are \"other like periodical receipts\", within the meaning of paragraph (f). The Income War Tax Act, as the name implies and as the language of the defining section discloses, is intended to impose a tax on income. In Withers v. Nethersole\n15, Lord Simon, delivering the judgment of the House of Lords, said in part (p. 402) :\u2014\nMuch emphasis was laid by the Crown on r. 19(2) of the General Rules which begins: \"Where any royalty or other sum is paid in respect of a user of a patent \u2026\" but the Solicitor General did not dispute the Master of the Rolls' proposition (which is plainly correct) that \"other sum\" in the phrase quoted means other sum which is of a revenue nature and does not include a capital sum.\nIn my opinion, the same rule of construction should be applied to the language above quoted and so the \"other like periodical receipts\" referred to are those of an income or revenue, as distinguished from a capital nature. I think the payments stipulated for by the agreement in question were instalments on account of the purchase price of the franchise of a capital nature, such as were the annuities stipulated for as part of the sale price of property considered by this Court in Wilder v. Minister of National Revenue 16. Since I consider that these payments do not fall within any of the four classifications mentioned in subparagraph (f), it is unnecessary to consider whether they are otherwise payments of the nature referred to in the concluding portion of the paragraph.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Act, 1940, c. 40.\nThe Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act, (S. of P.E.I., 1940, c. 40) as amended, delegated to the Lt. Governor in Council authority to establish schemes for the marketing within the Province of any natural products and to constitute boards to administer such schemes. On Sept. 5, 1950 the Lt. Governor in Council appointed the appellant Board and delegated to it power to regulate the marketing of potatoes within the Province. The Agricultural Products Marketing Act (Can.) 1949, 1st Sess., c. 16, authorized the Governor in Council to delegate to marketing boards which had been established under legislation of any province to regulate the marketing therein of agricultural products, like powers in the interprovincial and export trade. On Oct. 25, 1950 the Governor in Council by P.C. 5159 delegated to the appellant Board powers in relation to the interprovincial and export trade in P.E.I. potatoes similar to those it had had conferred upon it with regard to local sales thereof. The Board thereafter issued several orders of which No. 1 imposed an annual licence fee on dealers engaged in marketing potatoes in P.E.I.; No. 2 a levy on dealers for every cwt. shipped from the Island; No. 3 a minimum price below which certain types of potatoes could not be bought from local producers and forbade consignment or export sales; No. 6 imposed a levy on producers in respect of all potatoes marketed by P.E.I. producers and made the dealers agents of the Board for the purpose of collecting the levy. No. 2 was repealed but any existing liability for the levy under No. 2 was continued. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco ([1]) upon a reference by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the four questions set out in the preceding head note. By order of the Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island, the Attorney General of Prince Edward Island and the Attorney General of Canada were at the outset granted leave to intervene at any stage of the proceedings. The Attorneys General of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland were by order of the Chief Justice of Canada, notified of the Reference on appeal to this Court. The arguments submitted sufficiently appear in the reasons for judgment that follow.\nR. H. Milliken Q.C. and H. F. MacPhee Q.C. for the appellant.\nJ. W. de B. Farris Q.C. and K. M. Martin Q.C. for the respondent.\nF. P. Varcoe Q.C. and J. T. Gray for the Attorney General of Canada, Intervenant. W. E. Darby Q.C. for the Attorney General of Prince Edward Island, Intervenant.\nC. J. A. Hughes for the Attorney General of New Brunswick, Intervenant.\nL. A. Kelley Q.C. for the Attorney General of British Columbia, Intervenant.\nJ. R. Dunnet for the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, Intervenant.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014In my opinion, the appeal of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board should be upheld.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco was delivered on the 31st of January, 1952. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council had referred to that Court for hearing and consideration the following questions:\n(1) Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Parliament Canada to enact The Agricultural Products Marketing Act, (1949) 13 George VI, (1st Session) c. 16?\n(2) If the answer to question No. 1 is yes, is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Governor-General-in-Council to pass P.C. 5159?\n(3) Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to establish the said Scheme and in particular s. 16 thereof?\n(4) Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board to make the Orders made under the said Scheme or any of the Orders so made?\nTweedy J. wrote the main judgment, in which the Chief Justice and MacGui additional gan J. concurred, the Chief Justice simply adding a few reasons.\nThe main ground of the judgment of Tweedy J. appears to have been that the Supreme Court of Canada in A.G. of N.S. v. A.G. of Can. ([2]) which held that the Parliament of Canada and each provincial legislature were not capable of delegating one to the other the powers with which it had been vested, nor of receiving from the other the powers with which the other has been vested. In the opinion of the Supreme Court in banco of Prince Edward Island that judgment was really decisive with respect to the first two questions in the reference under appeal. With deference, such is not the effect of the judgment of this Court in the Nova Scotia reference. It was made quite clear in our reasons for judgment that they only applied to the questions as put and which had to deal only with an Act respecting the delegation from the Parliament of Canada to the Legislature of Nova Scotia and vice versa. The unanimous opinion of this Court was that each legislature could only exercise the legislative powers respectively given to them by ss. 91 and 92 of the Act, that these sections indicated a settled line of demarcation and it did not belong to the Parliament of Canada or the Legislatures to confer their powers upon the other. At the same time it was pointed out that In re Gray ([3]) and The Chemical Reference ([4]), the delegations there dealt with were delegations to a body subordinate to Parliament and were, therefore, of a character different from the delegation meant by the Bill submitted to the Court in the Nova Scotia reference.\nBut, on the other hand, the delegations passed upon by this Court In re Gray and The Chemical Reference were along the same lines as those with which we are concerned in the present appeal. It follows that our judgment in the Nova Scotia reference can be no authority for the decision which we have to give in the present instance. It may be added that at bar counsel did not rely upon that ground in this Court.\nThe first question submitted to the Supreme Court in banco of Prince Edward Island had to do with the jurisdiction and competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact The Agricultural Products Marketing Act (1949), 13 George VI, (1st Session) c. 16. That Act was assented to on the 30th of April, 1949. The preamble, among other things, stated that it was \"desirable to co-operate with the provinces and to enact a measure respecting the marketing of agricultural products in interprovincial and export trade\". S. (2) of the Act reads as follows:\u2014\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may by order grant authority to any board or agency authorized under the law of any province to exercise powers of regulation in relation to the marketing of any agricultural product locally within the province, to regulate the marketing of such agricultural product outside the province in interprovincial and export trade and for such purposes to exercise all or any powers like the powers exercisable by such board or agency in relation to the marketing of such agricultural product locally within the province.\n(2) The Governor in Council may by order revoke any authority granted under subsection one.\nThe effect of that enactment is for the Governor-in-Council to adopt as its own a board, or agency already authorized under the law of a province, to exercise powers of regulation outside the province in interprovincial and export trade, and for such purposes to exercise all or any powers exercisable by such board, or agency, in relation to the marketing of such agricultural products locally within the province. I cannot see any objection to federal legislation of this nature. Ever since Valin v. Langlois ([5]), when the Privy Council refused leave to appeal from the decision of this Court ([6]), the principle has been consistently admitted that it was competent for Parliament to \"employ its own executive officers for the purpose of carrying out legislation which is within its constitutional authority, as it does regularly in the case of revenue officials and other matters which need not be enumerated\". The latter are the words of Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association et al v. A.G. for Canada et al ([7]). The words just quoted are preceded in the judgment of Lord Atkin by these other words:\u2014\nNor is there any ground for suggesting that the Dominion may not * * * *\nIt will be seen, therefore, that on that point the Judicial Committee did not entertain the slightest doubt.\nIn The Agricultural Products Marketing Act of 1949 that is precisely what Parliament has done. Parliament has granted authority to the Governor-in-Council to employ as its own a board, or agency, for the purpose of carrying out its own legislation for the marketing of agricultural products outside the province in interprovincial and export trade, two subject-matters which are undoubtedly within its constitutional authority. Moreover, it may be added, that in doing so Parliament was following the advice of the Judicial Committee in the several judgments which it rendered on similar Acts and, more particularly, on the Reference concerning the Natural Products Marketing Act, ([8]) adopted by Parliament in 1934 (S. of C. 24 and 25 George V, c. 57), (1937), that the proper way to carry out legislation of that character in Canada, in view of the distribution of legislative powers under the British North America Act, was for Parliament and the Legislatures to act by co-operation.\nI would, therefore, answer question (1) in the affirmative.\nQuestion two was not answered by the Supreme Court in banco of Prince Edward Island as a result of the fact that it had answered question one in the negative. As my answer to question one is in the affirmative, so will be my answer to question two.\nThe Governor-in-Council by P.C. 5159, passed on the 25th October, 1950, has done nothing else, nor more, than act in accordance with the powers conferred upon it by s. (2) of The Agricultural Products Marketing Act of 1949. Indeed the text of the Order-in-Council is practically and substantially the same as the text of the Act itself. Applying it to the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board, the Order-in-Council refers to the Scheme for the marketing of potatoes, made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council on the 5th September, 1950, and particularly to paras, (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (i), (j), (o) and (p) of s. 16 of the Scheme. The evident object of that enumeration was for purposes of interprovincial and export trade to limit the exercise of the powers conferred upon The Potato Marketing Board by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of Prince Edward Island to those powers which are exer-cisable by The Potato Marketing Board under the paragraphs so enumerated. As the Scheme itself, and, in particular s. 16, are the subject of question three, they will be considered by me in my answer to that question.\nIt will be noted that no question was put in the reference with regard to the validity of the Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act, 1940, 4 George VI, c. 40. The reference, therefore, assumes that the Act itself is valid; and the question is merely whether the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council had the required jurisdiction and competence to establish the Scheme and, in particular, s. 16. The purpose and intent of the Provincial Act, as stated in s. 4(1), is \"to provide for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the Province, including the prohibition of such transportation, packing, storage and marketing in whole or in part\". Ss. (2) of s. 4 is as follows:\u2014\n4. (2) The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may from time to time establish, amend and revoke schemes for the control and regulation within the Province of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products, and may constitute marketing boards to administer such schemes, and may vest in those boards respectively any powers considered necessary or advisable to enable them effectively to control and regulate the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products within the Province, and to prohibit such transportation, packing, storage and marketing in whole or in part.\nThen s. 5, without limiting the generality of any of the other provisions of the Act, authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to vest in any Provincial board any or all of the additional powers enumerated in sub-paras. (a) to (k) inclusive.\nWhen s. 6 was first enacted it stated that every provincial board was authorized to co-operate with the Do-minion Board to regulate the marketing of any natural product of the Province and to act conjointly with the Dominion Board, and perform such functions and duties and exercise such powers as were prescribed by the Act or the regulations. This was amended in 1950 by striking out the words \"Dominion Board\" in the second and fourth lines thereof and substituting therefore in each instance the words \"Provincial Marketing Boards of other Provinces\".\nThen s. 7 of the Prince Edward Island Act enacted that every Provincial Board might, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, perform any function or duty and exercise any power imposed or conferred upon it by or pursuant to the Dominion Act, with reference to the marketing of a natural product, to which was added, in 1950, the following:\u2014\nand, with the like approval, may accept and exercise all and any powers or authority granted by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to the Dominion Act. S. (8), which authorizes the Dominion Board to exercise its powers with reference to the marketing of a natural product, was repealed in 1950 and should no longer be considered.\nS. (9) of the Provincial Act, as amended in 1950, no longer contained the words \"in co-operation with the Dominion Board\", and should now be read without those words.\nI have referred to these amendments merely to indicate the present state of the Provincial Act, but, I repeat, that its validity is not submitted in the Reference, and the question is only whether the Scheme, adopted on the 5th September, 1950, was within the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to establish.\nIn fact, the only doubt suggested with regard to the validity of the Scheme concerns s. (16) thereof. Now, it is obvious that the Provincial Act itself had no other object than to deal with the local marketing within the province, and that intention is emphasized throughout the several sections of the Act.\nThe same intention appears in s. (16) of the Scheme. The opening words give the Potato Board powers exercisable in Prince Edward Island in relation to the marketing of potatoes therein. The Scheme defines what is meant by the words \"regulated area\" and that area is thereby limited to the Province of Prince Edward Island. Then these same words are repeated throughout the Scheme and, particularly, in the several paras. of s. (16).\nIt should be noted that although the Scheme is that of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board, it has received the approval and, in fact, was made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, and that question No. (3), therefore, should be considered only in respect of the jurisdiction and competence of the latter.\nThere could be no ground for suggesting that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council could not vest in the Boards constituted by it any powers considered necessary or advisable to enable those Boards effectively to control and regulate the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the province. This is especially given to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council by ss. (2) of s. (4) of the Act. I can see nothing in s. (16) of the Scheme which is not covered by the authorities so conferred upon the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, either under s. (4) or under s. (5) of the Act. We must come to\nthat conclusion more particularly in view of the absence in the Reference of any question concerning the authority of the Provincial Act and that, therefore, its validity must be assumed for the purpose of considering the Scheme.\nIn that connection it is significant that the answers of the Supreme Court in banco of Prince Edward Island were that the Scheme in general, and s. (16) in particular, were not within the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council \"unless and insofar as the Scheme can be limited in its operation to affect only transactions intended to be wholly and ultimately carried out within the Province\". That answer would have been more complete if the Supreme Court in banco had stated that it could be and should be so limited. It is sufficient for this Court to say that it must of necessity be limited to transactions within the Province. Far from there being any intention on the part of the Legislature of Prince Edward Island to extend its scope to transactions outside the Province, the Act itself and the Scheme took particular care to limit it to the local trade, and under all canons of construction, including, of course, The Interpretation Act (s. 31) they must be so understood.\nQuestion (4) of the Reference submits certain orders made by the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board and asks whether they were within the jurisdiction and competence of that Board and again the answer of the Supreme Court in banco was in the negative \"unless and insofar as the Scheme can be limited in its operation to affect only transactions intended to be wholly and ultimately carried out within the Province\". This, in my view, is practically an answer in the affirmative for none of those orders pretend to affect transactions outside the Province. However, Board orders Nos. 2 and 6(2) are singled out in the answer of the Court below. There is no object in directing our attention to Order No. (2), because, prior to the Reference being submitted to that Court, Order No. 2 was repealed. The objection to Order 6(2) is stated to be that it might be regarded as indirect taxation, and also that the tax or impost levied under that Order \"is clearly far in excess of the valid requirements of the Board for intra vires administration expenses, and must be taken to be imposed in contemplation of activities beyond the jurisdiction of the Board\". For that reason it was held that \"the levy is therefore ultra vires and invalid\".\nThe first answer to that objection is that it is based entirely upon a pure question of fact, of which there is not the slightest evidence in the record, and it is not to be assumed that the Board would levy any tax or impost in excess of its requirements. Moreover, the Provincial Act authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to vest in the Board any powers considered necessary or advisable to enable it effectively to control and regulate the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the province (s. 4(2) of the Act). The Board is undoubtedly competent to act in accordance with those powers. This Court cannot take judicial notice of facts which may be said to indicate that the levy is beyond the requirements of the Board for the objectives which it is to carry out. No facts of that character appear in the record. It will be time enough to pass upon that question whenever, in some litigation, it is shown that the Board has, in a particular instance, exceeded its requirements.\nI have no doubt that the Act itself and the Scheme approved by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council were amply sufficient to justify the Orders mentioned in Question (4).\nWith deference, I am unable to see how the word \"regulate\" in s. 19 of the Scheme indicates an intention on the part of the Provincial Legislature to extend the scope of this whole enactment beyond the confines of provincial jurisdiction. On the contrary, it seems to me that s. 19 should be \"regarded as harmless authority to confer and collaborate informally with representatives of the Nova Scotia Potato Marketing Board, the New Brunswick Potato Marketing Board and the Newfoundland Vegetable Marketing Board\", and for those Boards to \"act conjointly\" with the representatives of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board. Moreover, it should be pointed out that any action of the local potato board is \"subject to the approval of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board\".\nAs to the vague suggestion that the levy provided for in s. 16(k) of the Scheme might be looked upon as \"a measure of indirect taxation\", it has not been made a point for the decision appealed from, but it would seem to have lost its weight\u2014and I do not consider that it ever had any weight \u2014since the adoption of the Board by the Governor-in-Council.\nThe ingenious argument of Mr. Farris that the Provincial Board had no capacity to receive the delegation of powers from the Federal Government has failed to convince me. As stated above, Parliament could choose its own executive officers for the carrying out of this legislation, and when so chosen the Provincial Board became the agent authorized by the Governor-in-Council with \"all or any powers like the powers exercisable by such Board or agent in relation to the marketing of such agricultural product locally within the province\". That, of course, must be understood mutatis mutandis. The Board did not need the enabling capacity provided for in s. (7) of the Prince Edward Island Act. It became a body, or an entity, and it was not necessary for the Province to give it the power to \"perform any function or duty and exercise any power imposed or conferred upon it by or pursuant to the Dominion Act, with reference to the marketing of a natural product\"; or, in the words of the amendment of 1950, \"to accept and exercise all and any powers or authority granted by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to the Dominion Act\".\nSuch authority, as contained in s. (7) of the Provincial Act, was not necessary, except perhaps for the province to express its desire that the Provincial Board should not accept any authority from the Governor-in-Council except \"with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council\". In the present case, the Provincial Board received its powers directly from the Federal Government. But s. (7) can do no harm, since, in the exercise of the powers delegated to the Provincial Board by the Federal Government, the Board becomes the agent of the latter government and gets its powers from such appointment. On the whole, I would answer each of the questions in the affirmative.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014In delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in A.G. for British Columbia v. A.G. for Canada (Natural Marketing Act Case) ([9]), Lord Atkin, at page 389, remarked:\u2014\nIt was said that as the Provinces and the Dominion between them possess a totality of complete legislative authority, it must be possible to combine Dominion and Provincial legislation so that each within its own sphere could in co-operation with the other achieve the complete power of regulation which is desired. Their Lordships appreciate the importance of the desired aim. Unless and until a change is made in the respective legislative functions of Dominion and Province it may well be that satisfactory results for both can only be obtained by co-operation. But the legislation will have to be carefully framed, and will not be achieved by either party leaving its own sphere and encroaching upon that of the other.\nIn A.G. of N.S. v. A.G. of Canada ([10]), this Court decided that the method proposed to be adopted by the Legislature of Nova Scotia to meet this test was not authorized. In the present case, in the Court below reliance was placed upon what was there said by the several members of this Court but the opinion of none of the latter justifies the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco, or the reasons upon which that conclusion was based. In the Nova Scotia case, it was proposed that the Legislature should enact that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of Nova Scotia might, by proclamation, from time to time delegate to and withdraw from the Parliament of Canada authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or undertaking in respect of which such matter was, by s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of the Legislature and that any laws so made by Parliament should, while such delegation was in force, have the same effect as if enacted by the Legislature. All the members of this Court decided that this could not be done as a contrary conclusion would be obnoxious to the tenor and scheme of the British North America Act. By that Act certain powers were conferred upon the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of a province, and we held that neither could transfer its authority to the other.\nWhat is here attempted to carry out Lord Atkin's suggestion is an entirely different matter. At the outset, it should be emphasized that no question is submitted as to the validity of the provincial statute \"Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act\" (1940, c. 40). In substance, and, as will later appear, in very important respects, that Act is the same as the British Columbia statute which was held to intra vires in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([11]). Having provided for the constitution by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of a Board to be known as \"Prince Edward Island Marketing Board\" s. 4 enacts:\u2014\n4. (1) The purpose and intent of this Act is to provide for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the Province, including the prohibition of such transportation, packing, storage and marketing in whole or in part.\n(2) The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may from time to time establish, amend and revoke schemes for the control and regulation within the Province of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products, and may constitute marketing boards to administer such schemes, and may vest in those boards respectively any powers considered necessary or advisable to enable them effectively to control and regulate the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products within the Province, and to prohibit such transportation,, packing, storage and marketing in whole or in part.\nProvision was then made whereby the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council might vest in any provincial board, without limiting the generality of any of the other pro-visions, certain specified powers of regulation, including the registration of all persons engaged in the production, packing, transporting, storing or marketing of the regulated product and to fix and collect licence fees there from. S. 7 (as amended in 1950) enacts:\u2014\n7. Every Provincial board may, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, perform any function or duty and exercise any power imposed or conferred upon it by or pursuant to the Dominion Act, with reference to the marketing of a natural product and, with the like approval, may accept and exercise all and any powers or authority granted by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to the Dominion Act. By the interpretation section, as amended in 1950, \"Dominion Act\" means \"The Agricultural Products Marketing Act\" of Canada. This Canadian Act is c. 16 of the Statutes of 1949 (1st Session) and s. 2 thereof provides:\u2014(As to which see p\u2014).\nMy answer to the first question as to whether this Act is within the jurisdiction and competence of Parliament is in the affirmative. Parliament, legislating with reference to inter-provincial and export trade which it and not any provincial legislature has the power to do, may validly authorize the Governor General in Council to confer upon a provincial board appointed under the Prince Edward Island statute of 1940, the power to regulate such marketing. This Court held in Valin v. Langlois ([12]), that Parliament could confer authority and impose a duty upon a provincial Court in connection with contested elections under the Canada Elections Act. In refusing leave to appeal ([13]), the Judicial Committee indicated its approval of that judgment. Admitting, as counsel for the respondent argued, that the Island Board was not made a corporation and that its members are distinct from the Board as a whole, I reiterate the view expressed in Labour Relations Board, Sask. v. Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products Ltd. ([14]), that such a Board is a legal entity. Having been validly established by the Legislature, it has the capacity to receive and accept the authority authorized by Parliament to be conferred upon it by the Governor-General-in-Council. Counsel for the respondent further submitted that in overruling the judgment of this Court in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King ([15]), the Judicial Committee ([16]), drew a distinction between powers and rights exercisable within a province and capacity to accept extra-provincial powers. That is quite true but what was in issue there was the extent of the power of the Ontario Legislature under 92(11) of the British North America Act \"The Incorporation of Companies with Provincial Objects\". While the judgment of the Judicial Committee in that particular case proceeded upon the basis that the Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Company had really been incorporated by virtue of the Royal prerogative, there is nothing in the reasons of Chief Justice Fitzpatrick and Duff J., relied upon by the respondent, to indicate that they were dealing with anything more than the limitation of \"provincial objects\". In fact the latter pointed out that the question whether capacity to enter into a given transaction is compatible with this limitation was one to be determined upon the particular facts, and he held that on the true construction of the Ontario Companies Act the Company only acquired capacity to carry on its business as an Ontario business and that there was no legislation by the Dominion or the Yukon professing to enlarge that capacity.\nThe second question is as to the jurisdiction and competency of the Governor-General-in-Council to pass P.C. 5159. That Order-in-Council granted authority to the Prince Edward Island Products Marketing Board, as established by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, to regulate the marketing outside the province in inter provincial and export trade of Island products, and that for such purposes the Board might with reference to persons and property situated within the Island exercise powers like the powers exercisable by it in relation to the marketing of Island products locally within the province under certain paragraphs of s. 16 of the Island's Products Marketing Scheme as amended from time to time. It was not contended that, if the answer to the first question be in the affirmative, the answer to the second should not be the same.\nQuestion 3 is as to the jurisdiction and competency of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to establish the Scheme referred to, and particularly s. 16 thereof. In dealing with this question it is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of the Act under which the Scheme was adopted by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council. Sub-sections 1 and 2 of s. 4 have already been extracted and it is important to note that what is being dealt with is the control and regulation of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the Province. This same wording appeared in the British Columbia statute considered in the Shannon case. There, the Privy Council stated that it was apparent that the legislation was confined to regulating transactions that took place wholly within the province. After pointing out that natural products as defined were not confined to those produced in British Columbia, the judgment proceeded: \"It was suggested that 'transportation' would cover the carriage of goods in transit from one Province to another, or over-seas. The answer is that on the construction of the Act as a whole it is plain that 'transportation' is confined to the passage of goods whose transport begins within the Province to a destination also within the Province.\" Therefore, in view of the similarity of the British Columbia and Prince Edward Island statutes, unless a fair reading of the Scheme as a whole leads one to the opposite conclusion, it should not be held that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the statute and attempted something beyond provincial jurisdiction. For that reason, s. 4 of the Scheme, which provides: \"This Scheme shall apply to all persons who grow, pack, store, buy or sell potatoes of any kind or grade thereof in the regulated area\", is in my view valid.\nS. 16 of the Scheme is the one conferring specified powers upon the Potato Board and as it provides that \"The Potato Board shall have the following Powers exercisable in Prince Edward Island in relation to the marketing of potatoes therein\", it also is valid unless some particular clause thereof clearly goes beyond the statutory powers. The only clauses requiring consideration are (d), (e) and (k). I can find no objection to clause (d) which merely authorizes the licensing of potato dealers. Clause (e) authorizes the Board\n(e) to fix and collect yearly, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly licence fees from any or all persons producing, packing, transporting, storing, or marketing potatoes with power to classify such persons into groups and fix the licence fees payable by the members of the different groups in different amounts and to recover any such licence fees by suit in any Court of competent jurisdiction;\nIn substance this is the same as s. 5(d) of the Prince Edward Island Act:\u2014\n(d) To fix and collect yearly, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly licence fees from any or all persons producing, packing, trans-porting, storing or marketing the regulated product; and for this purpose to classify such persona into groups, and fix the licence fees payable by the members of the different groups in different amounts; and to recover any such licence fees by suit in any Court of competent jurisdiction; This s. 5(d) is in the same terms as s. 4A(d) of the British Columbia statute considered in the Shannon case and as to which the Judicial Committee held (page 721):\u2014\nA licence itself merely involves a permission to trade subject to compliance with specified conditions. A licence fee, though usual; does not appear to be essential. But, if licences are granted, it appears to be no objection that fees should be charged in order either to defray the costs of administering the local regulation or to increase the general funds of the Province, or for both purposes.\nClause (e) of s. 16 of the Scheme is therefore valid. Clause (k) authorizes the Board\n(k) to establish a fund in connection with this Scheme to be utilized in such manner as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Potato Board for the proper administration of the Scheme:\nand may stand as it is comparable to section 4A(j) of the British Columbia statute:\u2014\n4A(j). To use in carrying out the purposes of the scheme and paying the expenses of the board any moneys received by the board.\nwhich the Judicial Committee also held unobjectionable for the same reasons. S. 19 of the Scheme reads as follows:\u2014\n19. The Potato Board may name two representatives to act conjointly with representatives named by the Nova Scotia Marketing Board, the New Brunswick Potato Marketing Board and the Newfoundland Vegetable Marketing Board as a committee to regulate and co-ordinate the marketing of potatoes produced in the said provinces and in the regulated area, and the Potato Board may, subject to the approval of the Board, delegate to said committee such of its powers as it may deem advisable.\nNo authority can be found for the kind of sub-delegation therein provided for and, in my opinion, this clause is not within the jurisdiction and competence of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe fourth question is with reference to the jurisdiction and competence of the Board to make certain Orders under the Scheme. Order No. 1 provides that the dealers must take out a licence and pay a fee therefore of five dollars. Order No. 2 provides:\u2014\n(1) For the purpose of establishing a fund in connection with the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Scheme every dealer shall pay to the Board a charge at the rate of One Cent (1c) for every One hundred pounds of potatoes shipped or exported by such dealer from the Province of Prince Edward Island.\n(2) Each dealer shall render to the Potato Board on the 6th day of each month a statement of all cars of potatoes shipped during the preceding month which statement shall correctly show the quantity of potatoes shipped in each car. With each such statement the dealer shall forward to the Potato Board his remittance to cover the charge or levy provided by paragraph one hereof calculated at the said rate on the volume of potatoes shown by said statement.\nOrder 6, made February 14, 1951, by para. (1) repealed Order No. 2 \"subject to the provision that every dealer shall continue liable to pay to the Potato Board the full amount of the charge or levy which is now due or accruing due and unpaid in respect of potatoes shipped or marketed up to this date.\" By paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Order No. 6:\u2014\n(2) For the purpose of establishing a fund in connection with the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Scheme every producer shall pay to the Potato Board a charge or levy at the rate of one cent per hundred pounds of potatoes in respect of all potatoes sold or marketed by such producer.\n(3) Every dealer shall be an agent for the Potato Board for the collection of said levy or charge from the producers whose potatoes such dealer ships or exports.\n(4) Every dealer when purchasing potatoes in Prince Edward Island shall deduct from the amount payable by him to the Vendor of same the amount of the said levy or charge in respect of the potatoes so purchased by him.\n(5) Every dealer shall render to the Potato Board on the 6th day of each month a true and correct statement of all cars of potatoes shipped by such dealer during the preceding month, which statement shall clearly show the quantity of potatoes shipped in each case. With each such statement the dealer shall forward to the Potato Board his remittance to cover the charge or levy provided by paragraph 2 hereof calculated at the said rate on the volume of potatoes shown by said statement.\nThese paragraphs are clearly referable to export trade and cannot be supported. While Order No. 2 was repealed before the Order of Reference was made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the revoking Order (No. 6) provides for the continuance of any existing liability for the levy.\nI would therefore answer the questions as follows:\n1. Yes.\n2. Yes.\n3. Yes, except as to section 19.\n4. Yes, except as to Orders Nos. 2 and 6.\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of the Province of Prince Edward Island has referred for advice to the Supreme Court of that Province in banco, four questions which are the following: (As to which see p. 394) The unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal was that the questions should be answered as follows:\u2014\n1. No.\n2. No answer.\n3. As to section 19 of the scheme\u2014No. As to the scheme in general, and section 16 in particular,\u2014No, unless and insofar as the scheme can be limited in its operation to affect only transactions intended to be wholly and ultimately carried out within the Province.\n4. As to Board Order Number 6(2), and the now-repealed Board Order Number 2\u2014No. As to the Board Orders in general\u2014No, subject to the proviso set out in the answer to question 3.\nI fully concur with the view that the two first questions should be answered in the affirmative. I have no doubt that the Parliament of Canada has the necessary competence to regulate the marketing of agricultural products in interprovincial and export trade, and to co-operate with the provinces which have enacted legislation respecting the marketing of such products within the province. (Vide Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit Committee ([17]); (Marketing Act Reference ([18])) and ([19]).\nIt was also I think, within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General to pass P.C. 5159, and to vest in the Board powers which are identical with those authorized to be vested by the statute. (Shannon v. Lower Mainland ([20]) ; (Chemicals Reference ([21])).\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island relied upon A.G. of Nova Scotia v. A.G. of Canada ([22]) to answer in the negative, but I do not think that that case supports the view that has been adopted. The judgment merely decided that neither Parliament nor the legislatures can delegate powers to each other so as to change the distribution of powers provided for in ss. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. Here the issue is entirely different. The Federal legislation does not confer any additional powers to the legislature but vests in a group of persons certain powers to be exercised in the interprovincial and export field. It is immaterial that the same persons be empowered by the legislature to control and regulate the marketing of Natural Products within the Province. It is true that the Board is a creature of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, but this does not prevent it from exercising duties imposed by the Parliament of Canada. (Valin v. Langlois ([23])).\nAs to question No. 3, for the reasons given by my brother Kerwin, whose judgment I had the advantage of reading, it is my opinion that the scheme is valid including s. 16. However, s. 19 is not authorized by the Act. We find in s. 6 of the Act the necessary authority given to the Board to co-operate with other Provincial Marketing Boards to regulate the marketing of natural products, but nowhere do we find that the Potato Board is empowered to appoint a committee and delegate to it, subject to the approval of the Board, such of its powers, as it may deem advisable.\nThe charge or levy imposed in Order No. 2 and in Order No. 6 for the purpose of establishing a fund in connection with the Marketing Scheme, seems in either case to be clearly indirect. In the first case it is imposed upon the dealer, and upon the producer in the second, and, therefore, it remains that it is charged upon an article of commerce in course of trade and not against the final purchaser. The effect of this charge or levy necessarily tends to increase the sale price by the amount of the tax. (Atlantic Smoke Shops v. Conlon ([24]) and ([25])). Order No. 2 was repealed by Order No. 6, but as the revoking Order imposed a liability upon every dealer to pay to the Potato Board the full amount of the charge or levy due or accruing due and unpaid in respect of potatoes shipped or marketed, it follows that both must be held invalid.\nI would therefore answer the interrogatories as follows:\u2014\nYes.\nYes.\nYes, except as to section 19.\nYes, except as to Orders Nos. 2 and 6. Rand J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of a Reference by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of Prince Edward Island to the Supreme Court of that province of questions relating to both Dominion and Provincial legislation dealing with agricultural products.\nUnder The Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act of 1940, authority was conferred on the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to establish schemes for the regulation within the province of the marketing of any natural product, to be administered by a principal Board and marketing boards.\nBy such a scheme a board might be authorized, among other things, to require all persons engaged in a trade within the province to register and obtain licences, to prescribe licence fees therefore, and to fix maximum and minimum prices at which the product might be bought or sold in the province. A board could co-operate with the Marketing Board constituted under The Agricultural Products Market-ing Act of the Dominion, and, conjointly, exercise its powers under the local law. With the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, a board could accept and exercise any power conferred upon it pursuant to the Dominion Act in relation to the marketing of a natural product.\nA scheme for the regulation of the marketing of potatoes throughout the province was established by order-in-council of September 5, 1950. A Potato Board was constituted of five members which, besides the general powers already mentioned, was authorized to establish a fund for carrying out the scheme for which it might fix and collect charges in the manner as for licence fees; to borrow money for the objects of the scheme within a maximum aggregate of obligations of $10,000; to distribute among producers proceeds of the sales of potatoes; and generally to do such things as might be ancillary to these objects.\nThe Governor-in-Council, under the Dominion Marketing Act, by order-in-council of October 25, 1950 granted authority to the Potato Board \"to regulate the marketing outside the province of Prince Edward Island in interprovincial and export trade of Prince Edward Island potatoes produced\" in that province and for such purpose \"to exercise powers like the powers exercisable by it in relation to the marketing of Prince Edward Island potatoes locally within the province\" under specified paragraphs of s. 16 of the scheme as from time to time amended. Among the paragraphs omitted were (d) dealing with the licensing of dealers, (e) the collection of licence fees, (k) establishing a fund in connection with the scheme, (l) borrowing money, (m) distributing the proceeds of sales among producers, and (n) establishing technical and advisory committees and the employment of experts.\nThe questions submitted to and the answers given by the court were:\u2014\n1. Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact The Agricultural Products Marketing Act, (1949) 13 George VI, (1st Session) Chapter 16? Answer, No.\n2. If the answer to question No. 1 is yes, is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Governor-General-in-Council to pass P.C. 5159? No answer.\n3. Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to establish the said Scheme and in particular section 16 thereof?\nAnswer: As to section 19 of the Scheme\u2014\"No.\" As to the Scheme in general, and Section 16 in particular\u2014\"No, unless and insofar as the Scheme can be limited in its operation to affect only transactions intended to be wholly and ultimately carried out within the Province.\"\n4. Is it within the jurisdiction and competence of the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board to make the Orders made under the said Scheme or any of the Orders so made?\nAnswer: As to the Board Order Number 6(2), and the now-repealed Board Order Number 2\u2014\"No.\" As to the Board Orders in general\u2014 \"No, subject to the proviso set out in the answer to Question 3.\"\nFrom the answers this appeal has been brought.\nThe validity of the provincial legislation generally was not impugned since its provisions are virtually identical with those of the Act of British Columbia which was approved by the Judicial Committee in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([26]). The Committee there construed the Act as a whole to be limited to transactions strictly within the field of local or provincial trade. The administration of the Act so circumscribed, apart from co-operative Dominion legislation, may encounter serious practical difficulties if not insuperable obstacles; but that cannot affect its constitutional validity nor its administration conjointly with Dominion powers. The principal point of attack was the efficacy of the Dominion delegation. Mr. Farris argued that the province was incompetent to confer on the Board capacity to accept such powers from the Governor-in-Council. This question was not involved in Shannon, supra, as the administration there was provincial only and s. 7 of the Act was not expressly considered. The Potato Board is not, under the statute, a corporation, and the contention is this: the power to create such an entity and to clothe it with jural attributes and capacities is derived from head 13 of s. 92 of the Act of 1867 which deals with property and civil rights within the province; as the incorporation of companies under head 11 has its source in the prerogative, a body so created may have unlimited \"capacities\"; the prerogative is not drawn on for a body created under any other head than 11; a board created as here can have, then, only a capacity in relation to local law. From this it follows that the purported grant of authority from the Dominion is inoperative.\nThe central feature of this argument is the notion of the creation of an \"entity\". That a group of human beings acting jointly in a certain manner, with certain scope and authority and for certain objects, can be conceived as an entirety, different from that of the sum of the individuals and their actions in severalty, is undoubted; and it is the joint action so conceived that is primarily the external counterpart of the mental concept.\nBut to imagine that total counterpart as an organic creation fashioned after the nature of a human being with faculties called \"capacities\" and to pursue a development of it logically, can lead us into absurdities. We might just as logically conceive it as a split personality with co-ordinate creators investing it with two orders of capacities. These metaphors and symbolisms are convenient devices to enable us to aggregate incidents or characteristics but carried too far they may threaten common sense.\nWhat the law in this case has done has been to give legal significance called incidents to certain group actions of five men. That to the same men, acting in the same formality, another co-ordinate jurisdiction in a federal constitution cannot give other legal incidents to other joint actions is negated by the admission that the Dominion by appropriate words could create a similar board, composed of the same persons, bearing the same name, and with a similar formal organization, to execute the same Dominion functions. Twin phantoms of this nature must, for practical purposes, give way to realistic necessities. As related to courts, the matter was disposed of in Valin v. Langlois ([27]). No question of disruption of constitutive provincial features or frustration of provincial powers arises: both legislatures have recognized the value of a single body to carry out one joint, though limited, administration of trade. At any time the Province could withdraw the whole or any part of its authority. The delegation was, then, effective.\nThe next challenge was to certain provisions of the scheme. In the approach to them it should be assumed that, generally, they are intended only for the regulation of local trade, but several of them are couched in language that must be examined.\nBy clause 4 the scheme is declared to apply \"to all persons who grow, pack, store, buy or sell potatoes of any kind or grade\" in the province. I find it difficult to limit this language to local business, but to answer the question finally I take it in its application to the substantive provisions.\nThese are to be found chiefly in clause 16. para. (a) which enables the Potato Board to prescribe the manner of marketing generally; (6) to designate the agencies through which potatoes will be marketed; and (c) prohibiting the buying, selling, etc. of potatoes which do not conform to quality standards set by the Potato Board. So considered, there is clearly a regulation of external trade which renders clause 4 ultra vires.\nThe same result follows in the case of para. (g) which enables the Board to fix the minimum prices at which potatoes may be bought or sold \"for delivery in Prince Edward Island\". If the latter were an exclusively ultimate delivery for consumption, there would be no excess: but there may be intermediate deliveries in the course of external trade. Likewise, the application of para. (m), authorizing any agency designated by the Potato Board to distribute among producers the proceeds of the sales of potatoes, carries regulation beyond the provincial field.\nPara. (d) (1), providing for licensing dealers and fixing fees, construed to apply to all dealers requires a distinction to be made between fees primarily for revenue and primarily for regulation. In Brewers & Maltsters' v. A.G. (Ont.), ([28]), distillers and brewers operating under licenses from the Dominion were held subject to a provincial licence carrying a fee of $100 whether the product was solely for local consumption, for export, or for both. The fee was justified both as direct taxation and under head 9. Lord Herschell emphasized the uniformity of the fee, its relatively small amount, and that it was imposed without regard to the quantity of goods sold.\nIn Lawson v. Interior Committee ([29]), the levy was part of a local regulation of interprovincial and local trade; the tax imposed might vary with the quantity of the product marketed subject to a minimum and maximum amount of charge; and it was held invalid both as indirect taxation and as not being within head 9.\nIn Shannon, supra, the Judicial Committee held that in the regulation of exclusively local business by a system of licences, fees under head 9 were not restricted to direct taxation.\nIn Lower Mainland Products v. Crystal Dairy Ltd. ([30]), there were two local levies; a compulsory transfer of money from one set of dealers to another, and an assessment for expenses; in each case the levy was related to the quantity of product sold. Here, too, external trade was affected. Both were held to be indirect taxation and invalid.\nThe scheme before us is primarily one of trade regulation. Apart from taxation, so far as it extends to external trade it is invalid. Licence fees for revenue purposes with only an incidental regulation on local and external trade, as in the Maltsters' case, can be imposed on the latter if not indirect in their incidence, but if related to sales they become a burden on that trade and, as in Lawson's case, are ultra vires. Clause 19 of the scheme was challenged. This authorizes the Potato Board to name two representatives to act with representatives of the Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland marketing boards as a committee \"to regulate and co-ordinate the marketing of potatoes produced in the said provinces and in the regulated area\"; and, \"subject to the approval of the (Provincial) Board, to delegate to that committee such of its powers as it may deem advisable.\" Co-operative action between boards of different provinces having the same administrative objects is quite unobjectionable; but I find nothing in the statute permitting a sub-delegation of powers of this nature.\nFinally, order No. 6 of the Potato Board was attacked. It provides that \"for the purpose of establishing a fund in connection with the scheme, every dealer shall pay to the Board a charge at the rate of one cent (1c) for every hundred pounds of potatoes shipped from the province.\" As mentioned, neither para. (e) of clause 16, which authorizes licence fees nor (k) which permits the establishment of a fund by means of similar fees, was adopted by the Dominion order-in-council, and I cannot take it that that express omission can be supplied by either (o) or (p) which authorize generally such acts as may be considered necessary to the execution of the scheme. On the contrary view, (o) and (p) would be sufficient in themselves for the entire administration on behalf of the Dominion; but the order-in-council specifies with particularity only nine paragraphs out of sixteen in clause 16 and adopts no other clause. The assessment is clearly a mode of indirect taxation effecting primarily a regulation of trade: and as the cases examined indicate, its application to trade beyond the province puts it ultra the powers of the Board.\nThis order purported to repeal order No. 2 which provided for a similar assessment and which for the same reasons was invalid; and the purported preservation in order No. 6 of unpaid levies under No. 2 likewise fails.\nI would, therefore, answer the questions as follows:\u2014\n1. Yes.\n2. Yes.\n3. Except as to sections Nos. 4 and 19, Yes.\n4. Except as to orders Nos. 2 and 6, Yes. The judgment of Kellock and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:-\nKellock, J.:\u2014The central question in this appeal is as to the respective jurisdictions of Parliament and the provincial legislature with respect to regulation of the marketing of a natural product. It is now settled that neither jurisdiction is competent without the other to cover the entire field of local as well as interprovincial and inter-national marketing. The limitation upon the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament was settled by the decisions in The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Co. ([31]), and A.G. for B.C. v. A.G. for Canada ([32]), (Natural Products Marketing Act Reference). While on the other hand, the limitation under which the legislature of a province labours is illustrated by the decision in Lawson v. Interior Tree, Fruit and Vegetable Committee ([33]). It was pointed out by Lord Atkin in the Natural Products Reference supra, at 389, that satisfactory results cannot be achieved by either legislature leaving its own sphere and encroaching upon that of the other.\nThe scheme here in question was established by a provincial Order-in-Council under the provisions of the Agricultural Products Marketing (P.E.I.) Act (1940) 4 Geo. VI c. 40, as amended in 1950 by 14 Geo. VI c. 18. The purpose and intent of the statute is stated in s. 4, ss. 1, to be\nto provide for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the province, including the prohibition of such transportation, packing, storage and marketing in whole or in part.\nBy ss. 2, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council is authorized to establish, amend and revoke schemes for the control and regulation within the province of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products, to constitute marketing boards to administer such schemes, and to vest in such boards any powers considered necessary or advisable for the purpose. This statute, with some minor differences, is essentially in the form of the statute of British Columbia, in question in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([34]), which was held to be intra vires of the provincial legislature. In that case, after pointing out that it is now well settled that s. 91(2) of the British North America Act does not give the Dominion the power to regulate for legitimate provincial purposes particular trades or businesses so far as the trade or business is confined to the province, Lord Atkin said at p. 719:\u2014\nAnd it follows that to the extent that the Dominion is forbidden to regulate within the province, the Province itself has the right under its legislative powers over property and civil rights within the Province.\nAt p. 720 he added:\nThe pith and substance of this Act is that it is an Act to regulate particular businesses entirely within the Province, and it is therefore intra vires of the Province.\nNone of the questions on the present reference relates to the competency of the provincial statute here in question, no doubt because of the decision in Shannon's case.\nThe grounds of attack upon the scheme in the case at bar are that (a) its whole purpose and result is to control extra provincial trade; (b) the legislative powers of Parliament cannot foe delegated to a provincial legislature or any agency thereof; and (c) the taxes imposed by rules Nos. 2 and 6 of the Potato Board are not authorized by the statute and in any event are indirect.\nThe provincial Order-in-Council was made on September 5, 1950, subsequent to the Dominion Act which had been assented to on April 30, 1949, but before P.C. 5159 was made there under on October 25, 1950. With respect to the second ground of attack, with which I shall deal first, there is in fact no question here of any delegation of legislative authority by Parliament either to the provincial legislature or to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council. Neither the Dominion statute nor P.C. 5159 purports to empower either to do anything. Mr. Farris contends that the Canadian Act is incompetent to confer any authority on the provincial board for the reason that the board, although not a corporation, is an entity apart from its members, and the provincial legislature is without legislative competence to endow it with capacity to accept\npowers from Parliament exercisable with respect to international and interprovincial trade. He referred to the\njudgment of Farwell J. in Taff Vale Ry. Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Ry. Servants ([35]).\nIn my opinion, the provincial board \"is but a name for the individuals that compose it,\" to adopt the language of Atkin L.J., as he then was in Mackenzie-Kennedy v. Air Council ([36]). Under the legislation there in question, the Air Council was given attributes more closely resembling those of a corporation than in the case of the provincial board. But, like the board, the Council was not expressly created a corporation. It was held by all the members of the court that the Council was not a corporation. Atkin L.J., in the course of his judgment, pointed out that there were in existence prior to the Act of 1917, by which the Air Council was constituted, other statutes expressly constituting department of state, corporations. At p. 534, after referring to the language of Littledale J. in Tone River Conservators v. Ash ([37]), namely, that \"To create a corporation by charter or Act of Parliament it is not necessary that any particular form of words be used. It is sufficient if the intent to incorporate be evident,\" the learned Lord Justice said:\nIf it had been intended to incorporate the Air Council one would have expected the well known precedents to be followed with express words of incorporation, and express definition of the purposes for which the department was incorporated.\nIn these circumstances, he found himself unable to find, in the language employed by the Legislature, \"the manifest intention to incorporate\" which Littledale J. thought essential.\nIn the case at bar there is, in my opinion, a clear indication to be found in the legislation that it was not the intention of the provincial Legislature to incorporate. The statute of 1940 followed and repealed the earlier P.E.I. Natural Products Marketing Act (1934) 24 Geo. V c. 17. By s. 3 of that statute the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council was authorized to establish a board for the purposes of the statute, and the board, by ss. 6, was expressly made a body corporate, but when the Act of 1940 was passed, ss. 6 of the earlier legislation was dropped. A further indication of the legislative intention may be gathered from s. 7 of the Act to amend the statute law, c. 1 of the statute of 1951, which adds a new section to the Act of 1940, as follows:\n16. No action shall be brought against any person who since the fifth day of September, 1950, has acted or purported to act or who hereafter acts or purports to act as a member of any board appointed under or pursuant to the provisions of this Act for anything done by him in good faith in the performance or intended performance of his duties under this Act.\nI therefore think that there is no question of incorporation in the case of the provincial board, and that the principle to which Mr. Farris called our attention does not apply. There is, accordingly, no lack of capacity on the part of the individuals, from time to time, who make up the potato board to receive authority from Parliament.\nComing to the scheme itself, it must depend for its validity upon the provincial statute alone, as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council derives his authority to establish the scheme from that statute and from that statute alone. Para. 4 of the scheme provides that it shall apply to \"all\" persons who grow, pick, store, buy or sell potatoes of any kind or grade thereof in the regulated area. Para. 16 provides that the Potato Board shall have certain powers exercisable \"in Prince Edward Island\" in relation to the marketing of potatoes \"therein\", including the power (a) to prescribe the manner in which potatoes shall be marketed, (b) to designate the agency through which potatoes shall be marketed, (c) to prohibit the buying, selling, packing, storing or transporting of potatoes which do not conform to quality standards, (d) to license potato dealers and determine the amount of licence fees and the terms and conditions upon which dealers may buy, sell, transport and otherwise handle potatoes, (e) to fix and collect licence fees from all or any persons so engaged, (f) to exempt any person or class from the scheme, (g) to fix the minimum price or prices at which potatoes may be bought or sold \"in Prince Edward Island for delivery in Prince Edward Island,\" (h) to require production of records, (i) to regulate the shipment and marketing of potatoes in such manner as the board may deem advisable, (j) to establish a fund in connection with the scheme and to fix and collect charges in a similar manner to the collection of licence fees from all or any persons producing, packing, transporting, storing or marketing potatoes. Para. 18 provides that every person who buys, sells, transports, or otherwise handles potatoes shall have a licence issued by the board, and no person may buy, sell, offer for sale, or otherwise deal in potatoes produced in the regulated area unless he is in possession of a licence.\nOn November 6, 1950, the board issued its Order No. 1 providing that no dealer should engage in the marketing of potatoes without a dealer's licence obtained from the board. On December 18, 1950, by Order No. 3 the board fixed certain minimum prices at which potatoes might be bought from producers delivered at \"Prince Edward Island shipping points.\" Sub-para. 3 provided that from and after midnight of December 20, 1950, no dealer or other person should sell or market potatoes on consignment or ship potatoes \"from\" Prince Edward Island for sale on consignment.\nOn November 6, 1950, Order No. 2 had been passed levying a charge of one cent for every one hundred pounds of potatoes \"shipped or exported\" by dealers \"from\" the province, but by Order No. 6 of February 14, 1951, Order No. 2 was repealed, but the liability of dealers for amounts then due was preserved. Order No. 6 goes on to provide that every producer shall pay a levy of one cent per one hundred pounds of potatoes in respect of \"all potatoes sold or marketed by such producer.\" Every dealer is to be an agent of the board for the purpose of collection of this levy.\nBy para. 19 the board is authorized to name two representatives to act conjointly with representatives named under the authority of legislation of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to \"regulate and co-ordinate the marketing of potatoes produced in the said provinces\" and in Prince Edward Island, and to delegate to such committee the powers of the board. In my view, the powers so given go beyond the mere regulation of the potato trade within the province or carriage thereof from one provincial point to another, and encroach upon the sphere of the regulation of inter provincial and export trade. There is no attempt to confine the scheme or the orders under it to local as distinguished from export trade, and it is to be remembered, as was admitted at the bar, that the business of marketing potatoes in the province is preponderantly an export business.\nThe order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council would appear to have been passed on the theory that in so far as it went beyond the matter of regulation of purely local trade, the powers of the board could be supplemented by an Order-in-Council under the Dominion statute. That this is so was quite frankly admitted by the Attorney-General for Prince Edward Island in his argument before this court. The provincial Order-in-Council is to be judged, however, on the basis of that which was authorized by the provincial statute alone, as the competency of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council could not be increased by anything which might be done by the Governor-General-in-Council under the Dominion Act; A.G. for N.S. v. A.G. for Canada ([38]). I see no basis upon which the good may be severed from the bad. I therefore conclude that the scheme is invalid. While the Dominion Order-in-Council is valid to clothe the designated individuals with authority to regulate interprovincial and international trade, it is clear, in my view, that the orders made by the board apply and were intended to apply indiscriminately over the whole field, local, interprovincial and international, and are there-fore incapable of being supported in the restricted field.\nIn the result, while it is clearly within the competence of Parliament and a provincial legislature to authorize an agency such as the agency contemplated by the legislation here in question so as to bring about regulation of the whole field of trade in a natural product, it is necessary that the Dominion and provincial legislation respectively be confined to the legislative jurisdiction of each legislature. While in the Reference re the Minimum Wage Act of Saskatchewan ([39]), it was found possible to construe the legislation there under consideration as applicable only to persons subject to provincial jurisdiction, I do not think it practicable so to construe the provincial Order-in-Council here in question, having regard not only to the form of its enactment but also to its subject matter. The legislative intention, as expressly disclosed by para. 4, extends over the whole field of trade, and even if that paragraph could be written out of the scheme, the same intent is expressed in subparas. (a), (b), (f) and (i) of para. 16. In my view, to strike out any one or more of these provisions, leaving the rest standing, would be to rewrite the Order-in-Council, which I do not think it is open to the court to do.\nI would therefore answer questions 1 and 2 in the affirmative, and questions 3 and 4 in the negative.\nThe judgment of Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey, J.:\u2014This reference is concerned with the validity of a plan for co-operation between the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures in the marketing of natural products.\nThe legislature of Prince Edward Island enacted in 1940 the Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act (S. of P.E.I. 1940, c. 40) which authorized the Lieutenant Governor in Council to set up a scheme for the marketing of natural products. The language of this statute anticipated co-operation with the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Parliament of Canada in 1949 enacted The Agricultural Products Marketing Act (S. of C. 1949 (1st Sess.), c. 16) designed particularly to make possible co-operation with the provinces in the marketing of natural products.\nThe legislature of Prince Edward Island in 1950 amended (S. of P.E.I. 1950, c. 18) its statute of 1940 in order to make it more in accord with that of the Parliament of Canada. In this reference the validity of the provincial act is not questioned, no doubt because its provisions are, in all material particulars, to the same effect as those of the act of British Columbia declared to be within the competence of the provincial legislature in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([40]).\nOn September 5, 1950, as authorized by the provisions of the above-mentioned provincial statute, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, by Order-in-Council, established a scheme \"for the control and regulation within the Province of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing\" of potatoes. The Order-in-Council also provides for a board of five members designated as the Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board (hereinafter referred to as the Potato Board) to carry out the provisions of the scheme. The board elects its own chairman and may appoint a secretary-treasurer and such other officers and employees as the members may deem expedient. In para. 16 in the Order-in-Council its powers are particularly set out.\nThe Governor General in Council, under the authority of s. 2 of The Agricultural Products Marketing Act, passed P.C. 5159, October 25, 1950, granting to the Potato Board \"powers like the powers exercisable by\" that board \"in relation to the marketing of Prince Edward Island potatoes locally within the province\" as set out in nine of the sub paras. of para. 16 of the scheme under the provincial Order-in-Council.\nThe Government of Prince Edward Island referred to the Supreme Court of that province the following four questions: (As to which see p. 394).\nThis is an appeal from the answers given to the questions by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThe Agricultural Products Marketing Act is restricted to the interprovincial and export trade and neither purports to nor does it interfere with provincial trade as did earlier legislation declared to be ultra vires. Re The Natural Products Marketing Act 1984, as amended, 1985, ([41]) and ([42]). It is, however, contended that the statute is ultra vires in so far as it provides for the delegation of power by the Governor in Council as set forth in s. 2:\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may by order grant authority to any board or agency authorized under the law of any province to exercise powers of regulation in relation to the marketing of any agricultural product locally within the province, to regulate the marketing of such agricultural product outside the province in interprovincial and export trade and for such purposes to exercise all or any powers like the powers exercisable by such board or agency in relation to the marketing of such agricultural product locally within the province.\n(2) The Governor in Council may by order revoke any authority granted under subsection one.\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island concluded that the Parliament of Canada, in the foregoing s. 2, had provided for a delegation of a type this Court held to be ultra vires in A.G. of N.S. v. A.G. of Canada ([43]). It was there held the delegation of legislative powers by the Parliament of Canada to a provincial legislature, or by a provincial legislature to the Parliament of Canada, of their respective legislative powers was beyond the competence of these bodies. The problem here presented is quite different in that it is the delegation by the Governor General in Council to the Potato Board, an agency created by the Legislature of the province.\nThe constitution of this Potato Board is similar to that of the Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan in respect of which Mr. Justice Kerwin, with whom my Lord the Chief Justice concurred, stated: \"* * * the Board is a legal entity, and * * * 'has a right to be heard in Court' \" Labour Relations Board, Sask. v. Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products Limited ([44]).\nIt is, however, contended that the Parliament of Canada cannot confer upon this Potato Board the powers the Governor General in Council sought to do by Order-in-Council P.C. 5159. Our attention was directed to the distinction between capacity and powers as expressed by Viscount Haldane in The Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. Rex ([45]), where he stated:\nBut actual powers and rights are one thing and capacity to accept extraprovincial powers and rights is quite another * * * In the case of a company the legal existence of which is wholly derived from the words of a statute, the company does not possess the general capacity of a natural person and the doctrine of ultra vires applies.\nThat the legislature appreciated the foregoing distinction between capacity and powers is evidenced both by the history of the legislation and the language adopted in the enactment itself. The legislature, in passing The Agricultural Products Marketing Act in 1940, repealed (s. 14) The Natural Products Marketing Act 1934 (S. of P.E.I. 1934, c. 17), which provided that the Lieutenant Governor in Council might establish a board to be known as the Provincial Marketing Board and, under s. 3(6) thereof, it was expressly created \"a body corporate.\" In the 1940 act the Lieutenant Governor in Council was again authorized to constitute a board to be known as the \"Prince Edward Island Marketing Board\" and to \"constitute marketing boards,\" but it does not contain a provision making either a body corporate.\nThe language of the 1940 statute is equally indicative of the intention of the legislature where, in relation to the marketing boards, it authorizes only the vesting of powers therein. S. 4(2), under which the Potato Board was created, provides that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council \"may constitute marketing boards to administer such schemes, and may vest in those boards respectively any powers\" and again in s. 5 the Provincial Board (which includes the Potato Board) may be vested with \"additional powers.\" Then the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, in constituting the board, provided in the opening words of para. 16 that it \"shall have the following powers.\" Whatever the precise nature and character of such a statutory unincorporated body, as ultimately determined, may be, it is sufficient here to observe that the legislature, in constituting this board as it did, without making it a corporate body, intended that the board should exercise the capacities of natural persons, but restricted the exercise thereof to the powers vested in them as a board. As stated by Farwell J., whose language was approved by the House of Lords, when speaking in reference to an unincorporated body, \"The Legislature has legalized it, and it must be dealt with by the Courts according to the intention of the Legislature.\" Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants ([46]).\nIt is conceded that the Governor-General-in-Council might appoint the five individual members of the Potato Board and vest them with the same powers as set out in P.C. 5159. When, however, it is appreciated that this Potato Board is an unincorporated legal entity with the capacity of a natural person, there appears to be nothing in principle or authority to prevent the Governor-General-in-Council designating and authorizing it to discharge such duties and responsibilities as may be deemed desirable within the legislative competency of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe province, under s. 7 of the provincial act, retains control over its board. The Governor-General-in-Council may, of course, from time to time, change, alter or withdraw any authority it has conferred upon the board under P.C. 5159. The scheme here created is, throughout, a co-operative effort on the part of the respective governing bodies in which each maintains its own respective legislative fields. The board, under the scheme, is responsible to the respective governments in the discharge of those powers which each has competently conferred upon it.\nThe principle of the delegation and imposition of duties by the Parliament of Canada upon bodies created under provincial legislation was recognized in Valin v. Langlois ([47]). With the greatest possible respect to the learned judges in the Appellate Court who held a contrary opinion, I think question No. 1 should be answered in the affirmative. The Governor General's Order-in-Council P.C. 5159 appears to be within the provisions of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act as enacted by the Parliament of Canada in 1949 and, therefore, the answer to question No. 2 should be in the affirmative.\nUnder question No. 3, if the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council has established the scheme within the limits of the act of 1940, the competence of which is here not questioned, it is valid. It is suggested, however, that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in passing para. 4 of the scheme, has exceeded the limits of the power authorized by the provincial act. Para. 4:\n4. This Scheme shall apply to all persons who grow, pack, store, buy or sell potatoes * * * *\nThe respective provisions of the scheme must be read and construed together. The general language setting forth the scope and application of the scheme in para. 4 must be read with the provisions of para. 16 granting to the board its powers. This para. 16 at the outset expressly states:\nThe Potato Board shall have the following powers exercisable in Prince Edward Island in relation to the marketing of potatoes therein.\nThe several powers enumerated in subparas. (a) to (k) are in accord with the opening words. When, therefore, the general language of para. 4 is read in relation to the powers as vested in the board under para. 16, it becomes clear that it was intended para. 4 should be construed and ought to be construed to apply only within the field of competent provincial jurisdiction.\nIn so far as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, in para. 16(d) and (e), authorized the Potato Board to require licences and to impose fees therefore, the act was within the competence of the province. Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board supra at p. 391:\nA licence itself merely involves a permission to trade subject to compliance with specified conditions. A licence fee, though usual, does not appear to be essential. But, if licences are granted, it appears to be no objection that fees should be charged in order either to defray the costs of administering the local regulation or to increase the general funds of the Province, or for both purposes. The object would appear to be in such a case to raise a revenue for either local or Provincial purposes.\nIt was also contended that subpara. 16(k) is invalid. It provides for the establishment of a fund \"for the proper administration of the scheme\" and contemplates that it shall be fixed and collected in the manner provided by subpara. 16(e). Such an imposition would appear to be within the competence of the Province, so long as it is not made in a manner and an amount that would cause it to enter into the price of the commodity and, therefore, to be in reality an indirect tax. Lord Herschell, in relation to the imposition of a uniform licence fee of $100, when considering it as a matter of direct or indirect taxation, stated:\nThey do not think there was either an expectation or intention that he should indemnify himself at the expense of some other person. No such transfer of the burden would in ordinary course take place or can have been contemplated as the natural result of the legislation in the case of a tax like the present one, a uniform fee trifling in amount imposed alike upon all brewers and distillers without any relation to the quantity of goods which they sell. Brewers and Maltsters' Association of Ont. v. A.G. for Ont. ([48]).\nThe language of para. 16(k) so read and construed does not appear to be objectionable.\nPara. 19 of the scheme provides for an interprovincial committee \"to regulate and co-ordinate the marketing of potatoes produced\" in the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and provides that, subject to the approval of the Prince Edward Island Marketing Board, the Potato Board may delegate to that committee \"such of its powers as it may deem advisable.\" This provision contemplates the provinces dealing with interprovincial and export trade and is beyond the competence of the province to enact. I would, therefore, answer question No. 3 yes, except para. 19. The scheme, as constituted by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, may be valid, and yet the board, in adopting orders and regulations, may exceed its authority and it is suggested in question No. 4 that the board has done so. The board has made seven orders, an examination of which would indicate that all but Orders Nos. 2 and 6 are within the authority of the board. Under Order No. 2 the board imposed, for the purpose of establishing a fund in connection with the scheme, upon every dealer a charge or levy at the rate of one cent for every 100 pounds of potatoes shipped or exported by such dealer. This Order was repealed by Order No. 6, but it was provided that any amount due or accruing due and unpaid under Order No. 2 remained an outstanding liability. Order No. 6 then proceeded to impose a similar charge or levy of one cent per 100 pounds of potatoes upon every producer in respect of all potatoes sold or marketed by such producer. It might be sufficient to say that neither the act nor the scheme authorizes the Potato Board to make a levy of the sort contemplated by these Orders, but there is a further objection to their validity. This charge or levy is in relation to a sale of potatoes and its nature and character is such that it would be passed on by the dealer as part of, and, therefore, would enter into, the price of the commodity. It is, therefore, in substance an indirect tax and cannot be competently enacted by the province or any agency thereof. Question No. 4 should be answered yes, except as to Orders Nos. 2 and 6.\nThe questions submitted should be answered: Question No. 1, yes; Question No. 2, yes; Question No. 3, yes, except as to para. 19; Question No. 4, yes, except as to Orders Nos. 2 and 6.\nAppeal allowed. Reporter's Note: Following the Reference by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco, by order of Campbell C.J. the appellant as a representative of the class interested in maintaining the affirmative of the questions put, and the respondent as representative of the class interested in maintaining the negative, were named nominal plaintiff and defendant respectively. On the fyling of pleadings it appeared to the Court in banco that questions were raised as to the validity of Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Prince Edward Island, and the Attorney General thereof and the Attorney General of Canada having been granted leave to intervene at any stage of the proceedings and the Attorney General of Prince Edward Island having intervened, and it appearing to the Court in banco that a conclusive determination of the said questions by the Court of highest resort was desired by the parties and that such determination could be more expeditiously obtained by removing the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was ordered by the Court in banco that the Reference be so removed. Pursuant to this Court's direction argument as to its jurisdiction was heard on Oct. 25, 1951. H. F. McPhee K.C. appeared for the appellant and K. M. Martin K.C. for the respondent. Judgment was reserved and on Nov. 2, 1951, Cartwright J. delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court holding that under s. 37 of the Supreme Court Act an appeal lies only from the opinion of the highest court of final resort in the province in any matter referred to it by the Lieuteant-Governor-in-Council and no such opinion having been pronounced the appeal should be quashed but with no order as to costs.\n[1] 29 M.

Warren, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 433\nDate: 1952-06-30\nLouis Philippe Picard (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nPierre Warren (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: March 24; 1952: June 30.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nJury trial, civil\u2014Production of plea after delays have expired\u2014Motion to fix facts\u2014Whether 30 days elapsed after case stood ready for trial\u2014 When \"stands ready for trial\"\u2014Whether plaintiff deprived of his right to jury trial\u2014Tacit consent to extension of delays to pleas\u2014Arts. 195, 205, 207, 442 C.P.\nThe respondent brought action against the appellant for damages for personal injuries in September, 1947, and made option in his statement of claim for a trial by jury. The appellant applied for particulars which were given only in January, 1948. The plea to the action\u2014 accompanied by a partial inscription in law\u2014was not filed until May 7, 1948. The respondent did not secure a certificate of default.\nOn a motion made by the respondent for the assignment of the facts to be inquired into by the jury, the appellant objected that the respondent was in default under Art. 442 C.P., having allowed thirty days to elapse from the date at which the case stood ready for trial without proceeding to bring on the trial, that consequently the respondent was deprived of his right to a jury trial and that the case should proceed in the ordinary manner, i.e., before a judge alone. This objection was maintained by the Superior Court but dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed since the respondent was not in default under Art. 442 C.P. and, therefore, was not deprived of his right to a jury trial.\nHeld: The right to a jury trial is an exceptional one under Quebec Law, the required formalities must be strictly observed and the delay under Art. 442 is of public order in contra-distinction with those pertaining to the filing of the pleas which can be extended by the parties or the Court even after foreclosure.\nHeld: As soon as the case stands ready for trial\u2014i.e., generally when issue is joined\u2014and remains thus during 30 days, the right to the jury trial is lost if the party who asked for it does not during that period proceed on the motion for the assignment of facts, unless the Court has granted an extension.\nHeld: In the present case, as there is no doubt that a tacit consent had been given for the late filing of the plea and partial inscription in law, the appellant was not, therefore, foreclosed ; and since, under the circumstances, the inference can be drawn from the conduct of the parties that, at least up to the time of the filing of that plea and inscription, there was a mutual understanding not to observe strictly the delays respecting the filing of pleas, the 30 days period had, therefore, not yet commenced to run at that time. Held also, that a judgment affirming or denying the existence of the right to a jury trial determines, not a question of procedure, but a substantive right and also a question of jurisdiction, and is, therefore, a \"final judgment\" within the meaning of that expression as used in the Supreme Court Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the decision of the Superior Court and holding that the respondent was not in default under Art. 442 C.P.\nJohn Ahearn, Q.C., for the appellant, As the plea was not filed within the delay of Art. 197 C.P., the appellant was in default to plead. He was foreclosed, and the case was therefore ready for trial and the delay of Art. 442 C.P. had commenced to run. Dudemaine v. Coutu 2, Morrison v. Montreal Tramways 3, Montreal Tramways v. Jacques 4, Consolidated Theatres Ltd. v. Nihon 5, Wise v. Boxenbaum 6 and Hoolahan v. Phee 7.\nThe right to a jury trial being an exceptional one, the formalities and the delays must be strictly observed.\n\"Ready for trial\" means ready for the instruction of the case, that is, the evidence and hearing.\nThe late filing of the plea with the plaintiff's consent does not revive the right to the trial by jury which had expired: Dudemaine v. Coutu (supra) and Hoolahan v. Phee (supra). This applies to an express as well as to an implied consent and the certificate of default is not required.\nOn the question of the jurisdiction of this Court, it is submitted that it is a final judgment as it determines a substantive right in controversy in a judicial proceeding. The judgment decides that the appellant must be judged by a jury, which is an exceptional mode of trial in Quebec. It is final in the sense that it settles definitely and finally that the case will be heard by a jury. It is also a question of jurisdiction.\nOscar Drouin, Q.C., for the respondent. The jurisprudence has been fixed for a number of years to the effect that \"ready for trial\" means when issue is joined. But the Court of Appeal in Quebec in its most recent cases has acknowledged that the issue, in spite of the delays provided by the Code, sometimes does not become joined solely and automatically by the lapsing of the delays, but that sometimes the consents of the parties can extend the legal delays for joining the issue: Parent v. Parent 8. Once the right to the jury trial is lost, the parties cannot revive it either by express or implicit consent. But a party can give to the other a procedural delay which would delay the commencement of the 30 days.\nIn the present case, a tacit consent for the filing of all the proceedings after the delays was given by both parties. There was a tacit agreement of will between the parties equivalent to a formal one, and, therefore, the delays of Art. 442 have not run during the period in question.\nOn the question of jurisdiction, it is submitted that this is not a final judgment as this is purely a question of procedure. The case of Dudemaine v. Coutu (supra) is not applicable as there the question was not raised and the appeal was dismissed.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux, J.: Par action, prise et signifi\u00e9e en septembre 1947, l'intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de l'appelant une somme de $35,050.00, \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels et a, en sa d\u00e9claration opt\u00e9 pour un proc\u00e8s par jury. Sur l'existence et la validit\u00e9 de l'exercice de ce droit au proc\u00e8s par jury au temps de l'institution de l'action, il n'y a aucune contestation. On a pr\u00e9tendu, cependant, que, subs\u00e9quemment, l'intim\u00e9 aurait fait d\u00e9faut de se conformer aux dispositions de l'article 442 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile et aurait, pour cette raison, perdu ce droit au proc\u00e8s par jury, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la cause doit s'instruire en la mani\u00e8re ordinaire, devant un Juge seul. Telle fut l'objection formul\u00e9e par l'appelant \u00e0 l'encontre de la motion faite par l'intim\u00e9 pour la d\u00e9finition des faits. Accept\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, cette pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant en appel 9. C'est de ce dernier jugement dont se plaint l'appelant apr\u00e8s en avoir pr\u00e9alablement obtenu la permission par jugement de la Cour pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Au seuil de l'argumentation du m\u00e9rite de cet appel s'est soulev\u00e9e la question suivante sur la juridiction de cette Cour:\nLe jugement frapp\u00e9 d'appel constitue-t-il, au sens de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014telle qu'existant lors de l'institution de l'action\u2014un jugement d\u00e9finitif, i.e. \"une d\u00e9cision qui d\u00e9termine en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie un droit absolu d'une des parties au proc\u00e8s dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire?\" Dans la version anglaise, \"droit absolu\" se lit: \"substantive right\".\nLe droit au proc\u00e8s par jury,\u2014objet imm\u00e9diat du pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9bat\u2014est, par suite des dispositions du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, un droit d'exception dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Dans le cadre de cette exception et sujet \u00e0 l'observance des formalit\u00e9s prescrites \u00e0 son exercice et \u00e0 sa conservation, ce droit demeure int\u00e9gralement la facult\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au justiciable de soumettre sa cause au jugement de ses pairs. Aussi bien une d\u00e9cision affirmant ou niant l'existence de ce droit d\u00e9termine-t-elle, non pas une simple question de proc\u00e9dure, mais un droit absolu ; et portant de plus sur la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal devant entendre et juger la cause, cette d\u00e9cision dispose \u00e9galement d'une question de juridiction. La d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Dudemaine v. Coutu (1) reconna\u00eet substantiellement ces principes. A la page 468, M. le Juge Taschereau d\u00e9clare:\nLe code, en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant en quels cas il y aura lieu \u00e0 ce mode de proc\u00e8s, a non seulement accord\u00e9 un droit aux plaideurs, mais il a aussi conf\u00e9r\u00e9 une juridiction \u00e0 douze hommes d'entendre ce litige\u2026\nCes consid\u00e9rations, portant sur le droit absolu du plaideur d'avoir, dans certains cas et \u00e0 certaines conditions, un proc\u00e8s par jury, et le droit absolu de tous les plaideurs d'\u00eatre, dans tous les cas, jug\u00e9s par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent, suffisent, je crois, pour conclure que le jugement frapp\u00e9 d'appel \"d\u00e9termine en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie un droit absolu d'une des parties au proc\u00e8s dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire\". Cette objection pr\u00e9liminaire doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\nSur le m\u00e9rite:\nL'appelant soumet qu'au jour de la pr\u00e9sentation de la motion pour la d\u00e9finition des faits, l'intim\u00e9 ayant laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler plus de trente jours, avait encouru la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de droit pr\u00e9vue en l'article 442 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Aux fins de l'examen et de l'adjudication de ces pr\u00e9tentions, il convient d'abord de reproduire au texte la version fran\u00e7aise et la version anglaise de cet article, d'en rappeler la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de pr\u00e9ciser, en fonction de cet appel, le sens v\u00e9ritable de certaines des dispositions de cet article.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise:\n442. A d\u00e9faut par la partie qui a demand\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury de proc\u00e9der sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui o\u00f9 la cause est m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s ou pour un nouveau proc\u00e8s, elle est de plein droit d\u00e9chue de la facult\u00e9 de le faire; mais le juge peut, sur demande faite dans l'intervalle, lui accorder un d\u00e9lai additionnel pour raison valable.\nL'autre partie peut, dans les quinze jours apr\u00e8s l'expiration de ce d\u00e9lai, proc\u00e9der au proc\u00e8s par jury.\nA d\u00e9faut de le faire, dans aucun de ces cas, la cause peut \u00eatre inscrite pour enqu\u00eate et audition en la mani\u00e8re ordinaire.\nVersion anglaise:\n442. When any party who has demanded a trial by jury allows a delay of thirty days to elapse from any date at which the case stands ready for trial or for a new trial, without proceeding to bring on the trial, he is thereupon by the sole operation of law deprived of his right to a jury trial; but the judge may upon application made within the delay, extend it for cause shown.\nThe other party may, within fifteen days from the expiry of the said delay, proceed to a trial by jury.\nIf the delay elapses, in either case, without such proceedings being taken, the case may be inscribed for proof and hearing in the ordinary manner.\nQue le droit au proc\u00e8s par jury soit un droit d'exception, qu'une stricte observance des conditions auxquelles la loi l'assujettit soit essentielle \u00e0 son existence et \u00e0 sa conservation, et que la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9dict\u00e9e de ce droit en soit une strictissimi juris, sont autant de propositions d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9es par la jurisprudence et plus particuli\u00e8rement par la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Dudemaine v. Coutu.\nLe fait qui am\u00e8ne cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance,\u2014l'article 442 le d\u00e9crit clairement,\u2014c'est l'omission \"par la partie qui a demande le proc\u00e8s par jury de proc\u00e9der sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui o\u00f9 la cause est m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\", ou, dans les termes de la version anglaise, c'est le fait, par la partie qui a demand\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury, de permettre qu'un d\u00e9lai de trente jours s'\u00e9coule \"from the date at which the case stands ready for trial without proceeding to bring on the trial.\"\nReste \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser le moment o\u00f9 la cause est \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" et la nature de ces proc\u00e9dures qu'il faut, avant l'expiration des trente jours suivant ce moment, commencer \u00e0 faire pour satisfaire \u00e0 l'obligation de \"proc\u00e9der sur cette demande\" ou \"proceeding to bring on the trial.\"\nSuivant la jurisprudence, la cause est \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" ou \"stands ready for trial\" quand la contestation est li\u00e9e. Les parties admettent cette proposition.\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ralement bien fond\u00e9e, cette interpr\u00e9tation cependant, ne peut \u00eatre et n'est pas, d'ailleurs, toujours tenue au strict absolu. Il ne fait aucun doute, en effet, que les expressions \"cause m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" ou \"ready for trial\" envisagent une situation plus large que celle pr\u00e9vue par l'expression \"contestation li\u00e9e\". Ainsi la contestation peut \u00eatre li\u00e9e par la forclusion de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense accompagn\u00e9e d'une inscription en droit partielle; mais on ne saurait, en telle occurrence, pr\u00e9tendre, de ce chef, que la cause est \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" ou \"stands ready for trial\" tant qu'il n'y a pas d'adjudication sur cette inscription car, aux termes des dispositions de l'article 195 C.P.C.:\nNulle contestation en fait ne peut \u00eatre inscrite avant le jugement sur l'inscription en droit, et ce jugement doit disposer de l'inscription en droit sans ordonner de preuve et sans la r\u00e9server au m\u00e9rite.\nC'est d'ailleurs, le point d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel (La-mothe, Juge en chef, Lavergne, Carroll, Pelletier et Martin, JJ.) dans Montreal Tramways Co. v. Hector Jacques 10, d\u00e9cision \u00e0 laquelle il est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 par la m\u00eame Cour dans Consolidated Theatres v. Nihon 11.\n\u00c9galement faut-il tenir compte du fait que, suivant le jeu de la proc\u00e9dure, il se peut que la cause \u00e9tant devenue \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" v.g., par la forclusion de plaider, cesse de continuer de l'\u00eatre par suite de la production autoris\u00e9e\u2014soit par la permission de la Cour ou par le consentement de la partie adverse\u2014d'un plaidoyer comportant des faits nouveaux. D\u00e8s lors, la cause n'est plus et ne peut \u00eatre, \u00e0 raison de cette forclusion ant\u00e9rieure, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\"; et, si moins de trente jours se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre le moment o\u00f9, d'abord, elle le devint par suite de la forclusion, et celui o\u00f9, subs\u00e9quemment, elle a cess\u00e9 de l'\u00eatre, par suite de la production autoris\u00e9e du plaidoyer, la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit au proc\u00e8s par jury n'a clairement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 encourue. Si, au contraire, trente jours se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre ces deux instants, sans que ce d\u00e9lai de l'article 442 n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 en vertu de la disposition y contenue, la partie qui a demand\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury devient en d\u00e9faut et la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de droit est acquise. Dans la premi\u00e8re de ces alternatives, il est vrai que la tenue actuelle du proc\u00e8s par jury est virtuellement retard\u00e9e par suite de ce consentement ou de cette permission relatifs \u00e0 la production tardive du plaidoyer; mais ce consentement ou cette permission n'ont pas pour objet ou effet l'extension du d\u00e9lai de trente jours, mais le recul de l'av\u00e8nement du fait \u00e0 compter duquel seulement la cause devient m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s et \u00e0 compter duquel uniquement, suivant la loi, il commence \u00e0 courir.\nLe d\u00e9lai qui est d'ordre public est celui \u00e9tabli par l'article 442. Les d\u00e9lais ayant trait \u00e0 la production des plaidoiries ne le sont pas; le L\u00e9gislateur lui-m\u00eame permet aux parties ou au tribunal de les prolonger, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s forclusion. (Donolo Inc. v. Joly 12.)\nQuelle est la nature des proc\u00e9dures qu'il faut commencer \u00e0 faire dans les trente jours suivant celui o\u00f9 la cause est devenue \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" pour satisfaire \u00e0 l'obligation de \"proc\u00e9der sur cette demande\" ou \"proceeding to bring on the trial?\" De toute \u00e9vidence, ces proc\u00e9dures ne peuvent \u00eatre celles qui sont ant\u00e9rieures et qui conduisent la cause \u00e0 ce moment o\u00f9 elle devient \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" puisque c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 partir de cet instant que commence \u00e0 courir le d\u00e9lai pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 les faire, mais bien ces proc\u00e9dures exclusivement prescrites pour le proc\u00e8s par jury, indispensables \u00e0 sa tenue actuelle, ou n\u00e9cessaires \"to bring on the trial.\" Ces proc\u00e9dures sp\u00e9ciales que vise l'article 442 sont donc les diverses motions pour d\u00e9finir les faits, former le tableau du jury, fixer la date du proc\u00e8s, assurer l'assignation du jury et sa composition. Dans Copland v. Can. Pacific Rly. Co. 13, Sir Alexandre Lacoste, Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel, rendant le jugement pour la Cour, d\u00e9clare \u00e0 la page 168:\nMon interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 442 est la suivante: Les mots \"cause m\u00fbre pour proc\u00e8s'' doivent s'entendre, quand la cause est pr\u00eate pour que l'on proc\u00e8de au proc\u00e8s par jury. Ce qui comprend les mesures requises pour en arriver \u00e0 soumettre la cause au jury, c'est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9finition des faits, la formation du tableau du jury, la fixation du proc\u00e8s, l'assignation du jury et sa composition. Dans Laurendeau v. L\u00e9vesque 14, M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9, avec le concours des Juges McDougall, Bertrand et Hyde, reproduisant un extrait de ses notes dans l'affaire Hoolahan v. McPhee, dit:\nLa cause est m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s lorsqu'elle est \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat qui permet de faire les proc\u00e9dures exig\u00e9es par le chapitre 21 du Code. La premi\u00e8re, c'est la motion pour d\u00e9finir les faits; puis viennent la pr\u00e9paration de la liste des jur\u00e9s, l'assignation de ceux-ci, etc.\n\"Il s'agit donc de d\u00e9terminer dans cette cause-ci \u00e0 quel moment l'intim\u00e9e aurait pu faire cette motion pour d\u00e9finition des faits.\nAinsi, il appara\u00eet clairement\u2014et cette conclusion suffit pour disposer du pr\u00e9sent appel\u2014que, d\u00e8s que la cause est devenue \"m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s\" et est demeur\u00e9e telle pendant une p\u00e9riode de trente jours, le demandeur qui, en sa d\u00e9claration, a demand\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury, encourt la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9dict\u00e9e en l'article 442 s'il laisse \u00e9couler cette p\u00e9riode sans proc\u00e9der sur la motion pour la d\u00e9finition des faits, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'obtienne un d\u00e9lai additionnel, \u00e0 ces fins, sur demande faite dans cet intervalle.\nCes pr\u00e9liminaires de droit \u00e9tant pos\u00e9s, examinons les circonstances et pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant relatives \u00e0 cette phase de la proc\u00e9dure o\u00f9, suivant lui, l'intim\u00e9 aurait encouru la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'article 442. L'intim\u00e9 ayant, le 22 janvier 1948, produit les d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration, l'appelant devait, dans les six jours subs\u00e9quents, produire sa d\u00e9fense. Ce n'est, cependant, que le 7 mai qu'il logeait au greffe un plaidoyer accompagn\u00e9 d'une inscription en droit partielle. Il \u00e9tait donc, \u00e0 cette date, et depuis le 29 janvier, forclos de plaider et, d\u00e8s lors, la contestation \u00e9tait li\u00e9e. Et, la cause \u00e9tant m\u00fbre pour le proc\u00e8s, commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 courir la p\u00e9riode de trente jours pour \u00eatre, celle-ci, \u00e9coul\u00e9e d\u00e8s apr\u00e8s le 28 f\u00e9vrier. C'est le jour suivant le 28 f\u00e9vrier que s'\u00e9teignait irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement le droit de l'intim\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s par jury. Le consentement qu'il pouvait, apr\u00e8s cette date, donner \u00e0 l'appelant pour la production du plaidoyer et l'inscription en droit partielle, \u00e9tait efficace \u00e0 la production de ces proc\u00e9dures mais ne pouvait l'\u00eatre \u00e0 la renaissance du droit au proc\u00e8s par jury.\nLa contestation n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9e par la production ponctuelle du plaidoyer, il appara\u00eet que la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des dispositions pertinentes de la loi et d'apr\u00e8s les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par le dossier, l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce, par la seule omission \u00e0 produire sa d\u00e9fense dans les six jours suivant le 22 janvier, forclos de ce faire. L'article 205, traitant de la forclusion, se lit comme suit:\nApr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai pour produire une pi\u00e8ce de plaidoirie, la partie d\u00e9faillante est de plein droit forclose de le faire sans le consentement de la partie adverse ou la permission du juge.\nLa demande du certificat constatant la forclusion est faite verbalement.\nLes dispositions de cet article ont fait l'objet d'une \u00e9tude particuli\u00e8re par la Cour d'Appel, dans la cause de Laskiewicz v. Montreal Tramways Co. 15. Rapport\u00e9e en abr\u00e9g\u00e9 seulement, il devient n\u00e9cessaire d'en reproduire ici certains commentaires pris aux notes de MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Pratte.\nM. le Juge Bissonnette:\nDe cet article, deux d\u00e9ductions s'imposent. Tout d'abord, si la forclusion existe de plein droit, il n'en reste pas moins \u00e9vident que le code exige qu'elle soit constat\u00e9e par un certificat \u00e9mis, \u00e0 la demande de la partie adverse, par le protonotaire. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ceci n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. En second lieu, cette demande de certificat peut \u00eatre faite, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion et \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de la partie, et quand elle le juge \u00e0 propos. Si donc, elle ne fait pas une telle demande, si elle ne fait pas constater la forclusion, c'est qu'elle entend accorder, du moins implicitement, un d\u00e9lai additionnel \u00e0 la partie adverse. Comme l'intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u par voie de signification, ces particularit\u00e9s, qu'elle n'en a pas demand\u00e9 le rejet et qu'elle a plaid\u00e9 sur icelles, il faut n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9duire qu'elle estimait, \u00e0 bon droit d'ailleurs, qu'il n'y avait pas encore forclusion au sens de l'art. 205 C.P. et qu'elle avait donn\u00e9 le consentement pr\u00e9vu dans cette disposition pour \u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai de production.\nM. le Juge Pratte:\nIl para\u00eet clair, \u00e0 la lecture de cette disposition qu'une partie qui a fait d\u00e9faut de produire une pi\u00e8ce de plaidoirie dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par la loi n'est pas absolument forclose; le texte dit seulement qu'elle est de plein droit forclose de le faire sans le consentement de la partie adverse ou la permission du juge.\nMais les consentements ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement constat\u00e9s par \u00e9crit, ni m\u00eame toujours donn\u00e9s en termes expr\u00e8s. Le plus souvent, dans la pratique, ils sont donn\u00e9s implicitement et peuvent s'induire de la conduite de la partie. D'o\u00f9 l'on voit que la question de savoir si la forclusion a op\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un cas donn\u00e9 peut donner lieu \u00e0 des discussions qu'il est important de pr\u00e9venir, pour une bonne exp\u00e9dition des affaires.\nC'est sans doute pour emp\u00eacher les d\u00e9bats possibles sur ce point, que l'ancien code exigeait que la forclusion fut demand\u00e9e et constat\u00e9e par un certificat du protonotaire.\nL'ancien code contenait deux dispositions concernant la forclusion: l'article 137 visait le d\u00e9faut de produire le plaidoyer, et l'article 140, les autres actes de la plaidoirie. Voici le texte de ces deux dispositions:\n137. Tout plaidoyer au m\u00e9rite, par voie d'exception ou autrement, doit \u00eatre produit sous huit jours \u00e0 compter de la comparution, except\u00e9 dans les cas auxquels il est autrement pourvu dans la section qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de.\nSi le plaidoyer n'est pas produit dans ce d\u00e9lai, la partie adverse peut en faire la demande et s'il n'est pas produit avant l'expiration du troisi\u00e8me pour juridique subs\u00e9quent, le protonotaire peut accorder au demandeur un acte de forclusion.\n140. Apr\u00e8s l'expiration de ces d\u00e9lais, la partie en d\u00e9faut de produire est de plein droit forclose de le faire sans le consentement de la partie adverse, ou la permission du tribunal.\nLe code actuel n'a pas reproduit l'art. 137. Quant \u00e0 l'art. 140, modifi\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rendre la disposition applicable au plaidoyer, il est devenu l'art. 205 du code actuel.\nCette derni\u00e8re disposition, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e, a eu pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de requ\u00e9rir le plaidoyer pour pouvoir forclore le d\u00e9fendeur, et ne contenait rien au sujet de la constatation de la forclusion. Mais, plus tard, l'article a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 en y ajoutant l'alin\u00e9a suivant :\n2e par.\u2014La demande du certificat constatant la forclusion est faite verbalement.\nIl est vrai que le texte pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 n'exige pas express\u00e9ment que la forclusion soit constat\u00e9e par un certificat, mais il implique n\u00e9cessairement une reconnaissance de l'ancienne r\u00e8gle d'apr\u00e8s laquelle il fallait faire constater la forclusion; autrement il ne servirait \u00e0 rien.\nDes commentaires pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, il suffit \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de l'esp\u00e8ce, de retenir qu'on reconna\u00eet, au jugement ci-dessus, que le consentement de la partie adverse\u2014et on peut ajouter, que la permission du Juge\u2014emp\u00eachent la forclusion; que ce consentement, n'\u00e9tant pas qualifi\u00e9 par le Code, peut \u00eatre \u00e9crit, verbal, expr\u00e8s ou implicite. Il suffit qu'il soit donn\u00e9. Il appartient \u00e9videmment \u00e0 celui qui l'invoque d'en prouver le fait et cette preuve peut r\u00e9sulter de l'admission de la partie adverse aussi bien que des pr\u00e9somptions n\u00e9es particuli\u00e8rement, soit de la conduite des parties, de la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre elles, ou encore des circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es au dossier.\nEn la pr\u00e9sente cause, il ne fait aucun doute que, le 7 mai, l'intim\u00e9 a tacitement consenti \u00e0 la production du plaidoyer et de l'inscription en droit partielle. Le dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune objection de la part de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cette production, ni aucun consentement expr\u00e8s ou aucune permission du tribunal relativement \u00e0 cette production tardive. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l'appelant s'est tout simplement content\u00e9 de faire signifier ces proc\u00e9dures par voie d'huissier. A ce moment, cependant, les trente jours \u00e9taient expir\u00e9s. Il devient donc n\u00e9cessaire de rechercher si ce consentement tacite pr\u00e9existait \u00e0 l'\u00e9coulement de cette p\u00e9riode. Le dossier manifeste que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas, comme c'\u00e9tait son droit, fait constater cette forclusion par l'\u00e9mission d'un certificat de d\u00e9faut, certificat qu'il lui \u00e9tait loisible de demander et d'obtenir si, v\u00e9ritablement, il ne consentait pas \u00e0 une production tardive du plaidoyer. Il pouvait \u00e9galement, s'il n'avait pas donn\u00e9 ce consentement, proc\u00e9der ex parte suivant les dispositions de l'article 207. (Morrison v. Montreal Tramways 16). Il ne l'a pas fait. L'intim\u00e9 avait lui-m\u00eame, ant\u00e9rieurement, b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un consentement tacite de l'appelant pour produire, bien apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, \u00e0 cette fin, par la Cour, les d\u00e9tails ordonn\u00e9s en premier lieu. En fait, il devait les fournir au d\u00e9but de novembre mais ne l'a fait que le 12 d\u00e9cembre. A tout cela, il faut ajouter que la d\u00e9claration en cette cause comporte pr\u00e8s d'une centaine de paragraphes. Qu'on puisse, sous toutes ces circonstances, d\u00e9duire de cette conduite des procureurs l'existence, au moins jusqu'\u00e0 ce stage de la proc\u00e9dure, d'une entente mutuelle \u00e0 ne pas s'en tenir \u00e0 la stricte observance des d\u00e9lais relatifs \u00e0 la production des plaidoiries, est une inference qui ne para\u00eet pas d\u00e9raisonnable. Aussi bien, ne peut \u00eatre tenue comme mal fond\u00e9e la conclusion unanime \u00e0 laquelle en sont venus les Juges de la Cour d'Appel, sur cette question de fait.\nPour ces raisons, je renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: G.

Simard, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 444\nDate: 1952-10-07\nLa Compagnie d'entrepreneurs en Construction Limit\u00e9e (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJean Joseph Simard (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: March 26, 27; 1952: October 7.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nContract\u2014Sale of steam shovel without certificate of inspection\u2014Whether sale null ab initio\u2014Whether tender of certificate before judgment was sufficient\u2014Pressure Vessels Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 177, s. 12, as amended.\nBy a written contract, the appellant sold to the respondent a used pressure vessel, namely, a steam shovel. Pursuant to its undertaking, the appellant made delivery at the respondent's sand pit. Subsequently, the respondent sought, by his action, the annulment of the sale on the ground that the shovel had been sold and delivered without the certificate mentioned in s. 12 of the Pressure Vessel Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 177 as amended), which provided that no such vessel \"shall be again commercially dealt with for the purpose of being again used, before its owner has obtained from the chief inspector a certificate authorizing the use of the said vessel\".\nAn offer to have the shovel inspected and the certificate delivered was made by the appellant before filing its plea and was renewed with the plea. On motion made by the appellant pursuant to Art. 392 C.P., two experts were appointed and reported that the certificate could be issued.\nThe action was maintained by the Superior Court and by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec on the ground that the sale in violation of section 12 of the Act was absolutely null and could not be validated by the tender.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nPer Rinfret C.J.: Section 12 of the Act deals only with commercial sales and not with a sale of the nature of the one in the present case. Furthermore, even if this were a commercial sale, the section is not aimed at the sale itself but at the delivery, and, therefore, at the most, there would have been a suspensive condition which would bring the case within the decision of Jean v. Gagnon ([1944] S.C.R. 175), since the certificate was tendered before judgment. But in fact, since the sale was not affected by the provisions of section 12, the delivery made satisfied all the obligations of the vendor towards the purchaser.\nPer Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ.: The word \"owner'' in section 12 of the Act refers to the vendor and, in this case, he had the double obligation of delivering the shovel and of obtaining the certificate. Without the certificate, the shovel could not be commercially dealt with and its sale would be voidable. But since the vendor had tendered the certificate before judgment, he had discharged the obligation imposed by section 12 and the sale was, therefore, now complete.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting) : Section 12 aims at furnishing the same security in second hand sales as in the case of new machines and applies to every stage of the sale from the contract to the delivery; and until the certificate is given, the vessel cannot be dealt with commercially and, therefore, the sale was null and void.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Galipeault JJ.A. and Casey J.A. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court and holding that the sale of the steam shovel was null.\nRoland Fradette, Q.C., for the appellant. Section 12 of the Pressure Vessels Act does not impose a prohibition which would render null and void the sale of the vessels mentioned therein. In any event, the disposition respecting the obligation to obtain the certificate, creates at the most a suspensive condition as regard the delivery of the vessel. The tender of the certificate was made before the plea to the merits (Jean v. Gagnon 2), and the suspensive condition was, therefore, fulfilled. Furthermore, even if the inspection had been made, the action was at least premature, since there was no allegation nor evidence that the condition could not be fulfilled.\nCharles Edouard Chayer, Q.C., for the respondent. The steam shovel which the appellant purported to sell without the certificate could not by virtue of s. 12 be commercially dealt with. The vendor has the obligation of obtaining the certificate and in this case the appellant had to obtain it before the shovel could be again commercially dealt with. The violation by the appellant of s. 12 rendered the sale non-existent because it had no object, the object here being \"hors du commerce\", and null ab initio, because it was prohibited by a law of public order. The respondent was therefore justified in refusing as he did the tender. Any way this sale is considered, it was not operative and therefore the tender had no basis. The case of Jean v. Gagnon (supra), cited by the appellant, is distinguishable. The Chief Justice: L'appelante, d\u00e9fenderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, se pourvoit \u00e0 l'encontre d'un arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) ,3 rendu le 2 mai 1951, rejetant l'appel d'un jugement prononc\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Chicoutimi, et qui a maintenu l'intim\u00e9 dans les conclusions d'une action en nullit\u00e9 d'une vente intervenue entre les parties le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1948. Les honorables juges Galipeault et Casey \u00e9taient toutefois dissidents et ont en cons\u00e9quence conclu au maintien de l'appel et au rejet de l'action de l'intim\u00e9.\nIl s'agit d'une convention constat\u00e9e par un \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9, en date du 16 f\u00e9vrier 1948, par laquelle l'appelante vendait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une pelle m\u00e9canique \u00e0 vapeur. Le prix de vente est stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 $2,500, payable $1,000 comptant, et la balance repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par trois billets promissoires de $500 chacun \u00e9ch\u00e9ant respectivement les 17 f\u00e9vrier, 1949, 1950 et 1951.\nL'intim\u00e9 a fond\u00e9 son action sur l'article 12 de la Loi des Appareils sous pression (c. 177, S.R.Q. 1941, modifi\u00e9e par le Statut 6, Geo. VI, c. 51). Il se plaint de ce que la pelle \u00e0 vapeur, qui est un appareil sous pression, au sens de la Loi, lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue et livr\u00e9e avant que l'appelante ait obtenu le certificat \"D\" autorisant l'usage de la machine (art. 15, par. 4 ajout\u00e9 par 6 Geo. VI, c. 51, art. 4).\nVoici le texte de cet article 12 :\n12. Tout appareil sous pression usag\u00e9, qu'il ait ou non, subi des r\u00e9parations, ne peut \u00eatre remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau, \u00e0 moins que son propri\u00e9taire n'ait obtenu de l'inspecteur en chef un certificat autorisant l'usage dudit appareil.\nLe contrat porte que la pelle est vendue sans garantie et que l'intim\u00e9 en prendra livraison dans sa carri\u00e8re de gravier, mais \"en autant qu'elle fonctionnera.\" La machine fut en fait transport\u00e9e dans une carri\u00e8re de gravier appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et mise en \u00e9tat de fonctionnement.\nLe 3 mars 1948, l'appelante \u00e9crivait elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et l'informait que la bouilloire de la pelle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inspect\u00e9e pour l'ann\u00e9e courante. Elle mentionnait, cependant, que la pelle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 inspect\u00e9e et qu'un certificat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis ant\u00e9rieurement; elle sugg\u00e9rait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de faire inspecter lui-m\u00eame la bouilloire de la pelle et elle lui r\u00e9clamait le paiement de la somme de $1,000, soit la partie du prix payable comptant, que l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas encore acquitt\u00e9. Sur r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, l'intim\u00e9 faisait savoir \u00e0 l'appelante qu'il exigeait qu'une inspection soit faite de la bouilloire. L'appelante lui r\u00e9pondit que l'inspection en question, pour le pass\u00e9 ou l'avenir, n'\u00e9tait pas une obligation que lui imposait le contrat de vente mais que cette obligation incombait \u00e0 l'acheteur, puisque ce dernier avait convenu de se porter acqu\u00e9reur de la pelle en lib\u00e9rant le vendeur de l'obligation de garantie.\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre fut l'action en nullit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9tention que l'appareil sous pression usag\u00e9, au sens de la Loi, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau, sans que le certificat pr\u00e9vu ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis.\nApr\u00e8s la signification de l'action, soit le 12 avril 1948, l'appelante fit venir un inspecteur qui se rendit au lieu o\u00f9 se trouvait la pelle \u00e0 vapeur. L'intim\u00e9 refusa d'en laisser faire l'inspection. L'appelante fit alors signifier \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une mise en demeure et lui fit des offres r\u00e9elles dans les termes suivants: elle offrait de faire inspecter la bouilloire, sans admettre toutefois qu'elle y fut tenue, et elle faisait \u00e9galement l'offre des frais de l'action avant la production de la d\u00e9fense, ajoutant que, si la bouilloire n'\u00e9tait pas dans les conditions voulues, elle consentirait \u00e0 l'annulation de la vente; mais, si le certificat de l'inspection de la bouilloire \u00e9tait \u00e9mis, l'intim\u00e9 devait alors se conformer au contrat de vente et payer la somme de $2,500, selon les termes de la convention. L'appelante offrait les frais dans une alternative comme dans l'autre.\nLes offres furent refus\u00e9es et l'appelante les renouvela par sa d\u00e9fense, consignant en m\u00eame temps la somme de $99.10 pour les frais judiciaires taxables de l'action avant contestation.\nApr\u00e8s la production de la d\u00e9fense, l'appelante fit motion pour faire nommer un expert, sous l'autorit\u00e9 des articles 392 et suivants du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile. Elle demanda que l'expert nomm\u00e9 fut un inspecteur du Gouvernement provincial exer\u00e7ant la fonction sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la Loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nLa motion ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9e, l'inspection de la bouilloire fut confi\u00e9e, du consentement des parties, \u00e0 MM. P.-E. Bourque et Antonio Bouchard, tous deux inspecteurs des appareils sous pression \u00e0 l'emploi de la province. Les conclusions des experts furent en tous points favorables \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du certificat. Ils ajout\u00e8rent que lorsqu'ils conna\u00eetraient le nom du propri\u00e9taire r\u00e9el, un certificat \"D\" serait \u00e9mis pour une p\u00e9riode d'un an, tel que requis par la Loi des Appareils sous pression.\nLe seul motif des jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 4 est que l'appelante a fait d\u00e9faut de faire inspecter la bouilloire et de fournir le certificat pr\u00e9vu lors de la vente, qu'il s'ensuit que cette vente est nulle de nullit\u00e9 absolue comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public.\nLa consignation des offres r\u00e9elles, la nomination des experts, la validit\u00e9 de leur rapport et le fonctionnement de la machine ne sont pas en question devant cette Cour.\nToute la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que la machine \u00e9tait dans des conditions normales de fonctionnement et que le rapport des experts \u00e9tablit sans conteste que la bouilloire, selon leur propre expression, \"est en parfaite condition\".\nLa question se pose donc en droit : La vente que constate l'\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 entre les parties est-elle inexistante, frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 absolue, par cette seule raison que l'appelante aurait enfreint l'article 12 de la Loi des Appareils sous pression ?\nL'appelante a pr\u00e9tendu devant nous que le d\u00e9faut d'avoir obtenu le certificat prescrit n'entra\u00eene aucune nullit\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce et que le d\u00e9faut de faire \u00e9mettre le certificat ne cr\u00e9e tout au plus qu'une condition suspensive qui n'affecterait que la livraison.\nJe partage l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par les juges dissidents en appel, le Juge en chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et M. le Juge Casey.\nJ'appuie cette opinion, tout d'abord, sur la nature m\u00eame du contrat de vente entre les parties. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une convention par laquelle l'intim\u00e9 est devenu propri\u00e9taire uniquement par suite de sa signature. Il fut convenu que l'appelante \"devra mettre cette pelle en marche, savoir la transporter sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Simard, soit dans son pit de sable, et la laisser en condition de fonctionnement\". \u2026 \"La Compagnie appelante ne garantit aucunement cette pelle \u00e0 vapeur; vu que cette machinerie est usag\u00e9e, qu'il est au gr\u00e9 de M. Simard de la prendre comme elle sera, rendue dans le pit de sable, en autant qu'elle fonctionnera.\"\nEt ce n'est \"qu'en consid\u00e9ration des motifs ci-inclus \u00e9nonc\u00e9s\" que M. Simard s'engage \u00e0 remettre la somme de $1,000, en monnaie, et la balance en trois billets promissoires de $500 chacun.\nJ'interpr\u00e8te ces stipulations comme voulant dire que la vente ne serait compl\u00e9t\u00e9e que lorsque la pelle \u00e0 vapeur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Simard, \u00e0 l'endroit mentionn\u00e9, et que la pelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en condition de fonctionnement. Ce n'est, en effet, qu'en consid\u00e9ration de ces motifs que M. Simard s'engage \u00e0 payer. En fait, nous sommes inform\u00e9s par les offres r\u00e9elles que l'intim\u00e9, m\u00eame \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 elles furent faites, n'avait pas encore effectu\u00e9 le paiement de la somme de $1,000 auquel il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9.\nJe suis d'avis que ce premier motif doit \u00eatre retenu \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9.\nEn second lieu, le texte de l'article 12 de la Loi des Appareils sous pression, dont l'intim\u00e9 demande l'application, \u00e9dict\u00e9 que tout appareil du genre de celui dont nous nous occupons \"ne peut \u00eatre remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau\". Je ne puis me rendre \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation. que cet article s'applique autrement qu'\u00e0 une vente commerciale. Or, il s'agit ici d'une vente civile. Ce n'est pas, en effet, pour en faire commerce que l'intim\u00e9 a acquis la pelle \u00e0 vapeur.\nAinsi que le fait tr\u00e8s bien remarquer l'honorable Juge Fernand Choquette dans un jugement rendu en l'affaire La Compagnie de Sable Lt\u00e9e v. Machinerie Moderne Lt\u00e9e, qui malheureusement n'est pas rapport\u00e9e, le mot \"commerce\" dans l'expression de l'article 12 n'a pas le sens du mot \"commerce\" dans l'expression \"hors du commerce\" de l'article 1486 C.C., non plus que dans le sens de \"commerce\" de l'article 1059 C.C. Il faut, au contraire, lui donner un sens qui se rapporte au droit commercial.\n\"L'objet du droit commercial est la sp\u00e9culation sur les meubles de toute nature, mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res et produits fabriqu\u00e9s, que les commer\u00e7ants ach\u00e8tent dans l'esp\u00e9rance de les revendre plus chers qu'ils ne les ont pay\u00e9s; dans l'article 1128 C.N., ce mot a un sens diff\u00e9rent, plus large et voisin du latin \"commercium\" ; il d\u00e9signe la possibilit\u00e9 pour une chose de servir d'objet \u00e0 un acte juridique (Planiol, Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de droit civil n\u00b0 1010.\"\nIl n'appara\u00eet pas \u00e0 l'article 12 que le l\u00e9gislateur ait voulu couvrir toutes les ali\u00e9nations (il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 trop facile de le dire). Par les termes dont il s'est servi, il a voulu limiter l'effet de la disposition \u00e0 la \"remise dans le commerce\" (\"commercially dealt with\"). On ne saurait dire qu'un objet est \"commercially dealt with\" s'il s'agissait d'une ali\u00e9nation \u00e0 titre gratuit, et\u2014il est presque inutile d'ajouter \u2014d'une ali\u00e9nation de nature non commerciale. Comment pourrait-on pr\u00e9tendre qu'une ali\u00e9nation de ce genre remettrait l'objet dans le commerce? Ce serait une contradiction dans les termes.\nEncore moins peut-on en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelante aurait vendu une chose \"hors du commerce\". S'il s'agissait d'une vente commerciale\u2014ce que nous n'avons pas ici\u2014il faudrait alors dire qu'un objet qui n'est pas jusque-l\u00e0 hors du commerce serait plac\u00e9 dans cette cat\u00e9gorie par le fait m\u00eame de la vente. Mais l'article 12 emploie les mots: \"remis dans le commerce\". Pour que l'appareil soit \"remis dans le commerce\", \u00e0 raison de sa vente, il faudrait qu'il soit sorti du commerce avant la vente. Or, d'apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9, c'est la vente elle-m\u00eame qui le met hors du commerce. Il ne peut \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois, par la vente elle-m\u00eame, et en m\u00eame temps \"remis dans le commerce\" avant qu'il en soit sorti.\nJ'en conclus donc par l'analyse m\u00eame de l'article 12\u2014 peut-\u00eatre que cet article, \u00e0 cause de sa r\u00e9daction, peut difficilement \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 m\u00eame \u00e0 une vente commerciale\u2014qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement il ne peut recevoir d'application \u00e0 une vente civile.\nCe qui, en plus, d\u00e9montre que ce n'est pas l'acte contractuel de vente qui est vis\u00e9 par l'article 12 de la Loi des Appareils sous pression, ce sont les R\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu de cette Loi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'autorisation donn\u00e9e au Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil \u00e0 cet effet. Il n'y a qu'\u00e0 lire les R\u00e8glements nos 64, 65 et 66 pour voir que c'est bien l\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l'article 12 a \u00e9t\u00e9 compris, m\u00eame dans le cas d'une vente commerciale. Ces R\u00e8glements se lisent comme suit:\n64. Personne ne doit remettre dans le commerce, pour servir de nouveau, un r\u00e9cipient usag\u00e9 sans l'avoir fait inspecter par un inspecteur.\n65. La personne qui dispose d'un r\u00e9cipient doit donner, par \u00e9crit, \u00e0 l'inspecteur en chef, le nom et l'adresse de la personne \u00e0 qui le r\u00e9cipient sera livr\u00e9.\n66. Apr\u00e8s une inspection satisfaisante, l'inspecteur \u00e9met un certificat \"D\" \u00e0 la personne \u00e0 qui le r\u00e9cipient sera livr\u00e9 pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9. Nul ne doit livrer ce r\u00e9cipient avant l'\u00e9mission du certificat \"D\".\nOn voit donc, tout d'abord, qu'il faut faire inspecter l'appareil usag\u00e9 avant de le \"remettre dans le commerce, pour servir de nouveau\" et que, dans le but de faire effectuer cette inspection, la personne qui dispose de l'appareil doit donner, par \u00e9crit, \u00e0 l'inspecteur en chef le nom et l'adresse de la personne \u00e0 qui le r\u00e9cipient sera livr\u00e9. Pour qu'une personne qui dispose de l'appareil puisse ainsi donner \u00e0 l'inspecteur en chef le nom et l'adresse de la personne \u00e0 qui se fera la livraison, il me para\u00eet n\u00e9cessaire que l'acte contractuel soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9. Je ne vois pas comment le vendeur pourrait accomplir cette formalit\u00e9 avant la vente. Mais, surtout, l'on remarquera que le R\u00e8glement n\u00b0 65 ne parle pas de vente mais de livraison.\nD'ailleurs, le R\u00e8glement n\u00b0 66 est encore plus cat\u00e9gorique. L'inspecteur, apr\u00e8s une inspection satisfaisante, \u00e9met le certificat \"D\", non pas au vendeur mais \u00e0 l'acheteur (\"\u00e0 la personne \u00e0 qui le r\u00e9cipient sera livr\u00e9, pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9\") ; et ce r\u00e8glement ne dit pas que la vente ne doit pas \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e avant l'\u00e9mission du certificat \"D\", mais simplement: \"Nul ne doit livrer ce r\u00e9cipient avant l'\u00e9mission du certificat \"D\".\"\nC'est donc avec raison, suivant moi, que l'honorable Juge Choquette, dans la cause d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e, fait remarquer que, d'apr\u00e8s ces textes, les formalit\u00e9s prescrites sont subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 la disposition de l'appareil; qu'elles ne doivent pr\u00e9c\u00e9der que la livraison et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elles ont tout au plus l'effet d'une condition suspensive, avec le r\u00e9sultat que, la condition \u00e9tant accomplie, elle a un effet r\u00e9troactif au jour auquel l'obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e (C.C. 1085).\nA plus forte raison cela doit-il \u00eatre dans un contrat comme celui qui nous occupe, o\u00f9 la vente n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaite par le seul consentement des parties et n'a pas eu pour effet de transmettre la pelle \u00e0 vapeur imm\u00e9diatement, puisque le vendeur s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 la transporter sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 la mettre en marche, \u00e0 \"la laisser en condition de fonctionnement\", et que l'intim\u00e9 n'en de- venait propri\u00e9taire que lorsqu'elle serait \"rendue dans le pit de sable et en autant qu'elle fonctionnera\".\nJ'en arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il est erron\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9ter l'article 12 comme s'adressant \u00e0 une vente de la nature de celle que nous avons dans le cas actuel, parce que c'est une vente non commerciale. Mais en plus qu'en appliquant cet article \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des R\u00e8glements nos 64, 65 et 66, m\u00eame s'il s'agissait d'une vente commerciale, ce n'est pas la vente qui est vis\u00e9e par l'article 12, c'est la livraison. Ce ne serait donc pas l'acte contractuel qui serait vici\u00e9 par l'absence d'un certificat d'inspection ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 cet acte et la vente ne serait pas d\u00e9fendue. La livraison seule le serait. Tout au plus y aurait-il donc condition suspensive qui ferait tomber la cause actuelle sous l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans l'affaire de Jean v. Gagnon 5. Dans ce cas, les offres r\u00e9elles de l'appelante auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en temps utile et l'intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb les accepter. Mais je dirais plut\u00f4t, en l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle, qu'entre les parties, la vente n'\u00e9tant pas affect\u00e9e par l'article 12, la livraison effectu\u00e9e par l'appelante satisfaisait \u00e0 toutes les obligations du vendeur vis-\u00e0-vis de l'acheteur. Seule la livraison aurait eu lieu avant l'obtention du certificat et pourrait, m\u00eame en mati\u00e8re commerciale, constituer une infraction technique \u00e0 la loi, qui n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler cette livraison, mais tout au plus de rendre le vendeur passible des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es par la Loi des Appareils sous pression.\nJ'infirmerais le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et celui de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel), et, adoptant les raisons ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, ainsi que celles de l'honorable Juge en chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et de M. le Juge Casey, je maintiendrais les offres r\u00e9elles de l'appelante et je rejetterais l'action de l'intim\u00e9, avec les d\u00e9pens de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 les offres furent faites, ainsi que ceux de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) et de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.\u2014Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable Juge en chef a expos\u00e9 les faits d'une fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te, et il est en cons\u00e9quence inutile de les relater de nouveau. Je d\u00e9sire cepen- dant ajouter quelques notes pour pr\u00e9ciser les raisons pour lesquelles je crois que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLa Loi concernant Les Chaudi\u00e8res \u00e0 Vapeur et les Appareils sous Pression (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 177 telle qu'amend\u00e9e par 6 Geo. VI, chap. 51), pr\u00e9voit que quatre formes de certificats peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9mis, d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme suit:\n1\u00b0 Le certificat \"A\"' \u00e9mis pour l'approbation de la construction des appareils sous pression apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification de tous les plans et devis et inspection finale desdits appareils \u00e0 l'endroit de la fabrication;\n2\u00b0 Le certificat \"B\" \u00e9mis pour l'approbation de l'installation des appareils sous pression, avant qu'ils soitnt utilis\u00e9s dans leur lieu d'op\u00e9ration ;\n3\u00b0 Le certificat \"C\" \u00e9mis lors de l'inspection annuelle des appareils sous pression;\n4\u00b0 Le certificat \"D\" \u00e9mis pour tout appareil usag\u00e9 avant sa remise dans le commerce.\nC'est ce quatri\u00e8me paragraphe qui nous int\u00e9resse, car il s'agit dans l'occurrence d'un appareil usag\u00e9, et dans ce cas, l'article 12 de la Loi trouve son application. Il se lit ainsi:\n12. Tout appareil sous pression usag\u00e9, qu'il ait ou non subi des r\u00e9parations, ne peut \u00eatre remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau, \u00e0 moins que son propri\u00e9taire n'ait obtenu de l'inspecteur en chef, un certificat autorisant l'usage dudit appareil.\nLorsque la Compagnie appelante a vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, pour la somme de $2,500, cette pelle \u00e0 vapeur usag\u00e9e, qui est l'objet de ce litige, elle avait donc la double obligation de livrer l'objet vendu, et d'obtenir de l'inspecteur en chef le certificat \"D\" autorisant sa \"remise dans le commerce\". Il ne fait pas de doute que le mot \"propri\u00e9taire\" que l'on trouve \u00e0 l'article 12 de la Loi signifie bien le \"vendeur\".\nCependant, l'appelante n'a pas rempli cette obligation qui lui incombait et qui lui \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e par la loi, mais sur r\u00e9ception de l'action en annulation de vente que l'intim\u00e9 a dirig\u00e9e contre elle, le 24 mars 1948, elle a offert de faire inspecter la pelle \u00e0 vapeur afin d'obtenir le certificat requis, et de payer les frais de l'action. Vu le refus du d\u00e9fendeur d'accepter ces offres, l'appelante a produit son plaidoyer dans lequel les offres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9es avec consignation. Lorsque la d\u00e9fense fut produite, l'appelante fit motion pour obtenir une expertise, et MM. P.-E. Bourque et Antonio Bouchard, inspecteurs du Gouvernement provincial, furent nomm\u00e9s de consentement. Le rapport fut \u00e0 l'effet qu'ils \u00e9taient d'opinion que le certificat \"D\" pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9mis vu que la pelle m\u00e9canique rencontrait toutes les exigences de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 voulues. La cause se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 une question de droit, et j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion suivante: Il s'agit, je crois, d'une vente \u00e0 laquelle une charge ou une obligation accessoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e par la loi, et impos\u00e9e au propri\u00e9tarie. C'est lui qui doit voir \u00e0 ce qu'un certificat soit \u00e9mis, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi, la pelle m\u00e9canique ne peut \u00eatre livr\u00e9e si elle \"doit servir de nouveau\". Si l'appelante n'avait pu obtenir ce certificat, condition essentielle \u00e0 la remise de l'objet usag\u00e9 dans le commerce, la vente eut \u00e9t\u00e9 annulable, mais en l'obtenant, elle l'a compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, et s'est lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'obligation impos\u00e9e par l'article 12 de la Loi.\nIl me semble difficile de concevoir une autre solution pour d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent litige. Il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que le vendeur d'un appareil sous pression usag\u00e9 trouve en premier lieu un acheteur \u00e0 qui il doit remettre le certificat \"D\", auquel est subordonn\u00e9e la livraison de l'objet vendu.\nSur r\u00e9ception de l'action, l'appelante a offert la pelle m\u00e9canique, s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e pr\u00eate \u00e0 fournir le certificat, et a consign\u00e9 les frais encourus. L'offre du certificat est venue apr\u00e8s l'action, mais ceci ne peut affecter le sort de la cause. Tant que le jugement n'\u00e9tait pas prononc\u00e9 annulant le contrat pour d\u00e9faut par l'appelante de remplir son obligation, celle-ci pouvait compl\u00e9ter son titre. (Jean v. Gagnon 6). Dans cette cause, cette Cour a confirm\u00e9 la jurisprudence et l'opinion unanime des auteurs. Ainsi, dans Gagnon v. La Coop\u00e9rative F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec 7, M. le Juge Dorion, parlant pour la Cour d'Appel, a dit ce qui suit :\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu'elle n'est pas dans le cas de l'article 1092 et que, admettant qu'il y a lieu \u00e0 l'annulation du contrat par suite de son d\u00e9faut d'en ex\u00e9cuter les obligations en n\u00e9gligeant de donner les garanties promises, cette annulation en vertu du pacte commissoire tacite, n'a pas lieu de plein droit, que par cons\u00e9quent, elle peut, en ex\u00e9cutant son obligation avant que jugement intervienne, emp\u00eacher cette annulation et se pr\u00e9valoir de son droit de payer par anticipation et de d\u00e9duire l'int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nCette distinction est parfaitement juridique et elle est admise par la doctrine fran\u00e7aise cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e.\nPlaniol (Vol. 2, 8e \u00e9d., page 437) s'exprime dans les termes suivants:\nLa r\u00e9solution, \u00e9tant l'\u0153uvre du juge, et non de la volont\u00e9 des parties, ne se produit qu'au moment du jugement\u2026 le d\u00e9fendeur peut jusqu'au jugement emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9solution par une offre d'ex\u00e9cuter son engagement. C'est aussi l'opinion de Baudry-Lacantinerie (Des Obligations, Vol. 2, page 189) o\u00f9 l'on trouve:\nAu contraire, lorsque les s\u00fbret\u00e9s promises n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies, ce fait peut \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 aussi longtemps qu'un jugement n'est pas venu d\u00e9clarer la dette exigible, et, par suite, tant que cette d\u00e9cision n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, le d\u00e9biteur peut, en ex\u00e9cutant sa promesse, \u00e9viter la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, etc., etc.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l'action rejet\u00e9e. Sur r\u00e9ception du certificat \"D\" auquel il a droit, et qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert, l'intim\u00e9 devra prendre livraison de la pelle m\u00e9canique et en payer le prix suivant les termes du contrat intervenu. L'intim\u00e9 devra \u00e9galement payer les frais de toutes les cours, sauf ceux encourus jusqu'apr\u00e8s plaidoyer en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nRand J. (dissenting) : The primary effect of the statute seems to me to be beyond doubt; to require as a condition of being an article of commerce that every new pressure vessel be built according to plans registered in the Department and under inspection authorized either by the provincial law or the law of the place of construction outside the province. The provisions contemplate construction, installation and operation; and they are designed to secure the safe condition of every vessel at the moment of sale.\nThen section 12 deals with second hand or used vessels and declares,\nTout appareil sous pression usag\u00e9, qu'il ait ou non subi des r\u00e9parations, ne peut \u00eatre remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau, \u00e0 moins que son propri\u00e9taire n'ait obtenu de l'inspecteur en chef, un certificat autorisant l'usage dudit appareil.\n\"\u00catre remis dans le commerce pour servir de nouveau\" means, in my opinion, to be made an authorized subject-matter of legal dealing; and it applies to every stage of sale from the contract to the delivery. To treat these two latter features, for the purpose of construing the statute, as severable, is to introduce a conception which the statutory language does not justify. What is aimed at is to furnish the same security in second hand sales as in the case of new machines; and until the certificate is given the vessel cannot, in any respect, be dealt with commercially.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: R. Fradette.\nSolicitor for the Respondent: C. E. Chayer.\n1 Q.R.[1951]KB.546.\n2 [1944]S.C.R.175.\n3 Q.R. [1951] K.B. 546.\n4 Q.R.

The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that it was a nullity ab initio since it had been taken against the mandataries instead of against the mandator. The respondent intervened in the action and asked to be declared the owner of the property in question. This intervention was also dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that it had to fall with the main action. There was no appeal from the judgment on the main action, but the respondent appealed with success the dismissal of the intervention.\nHeld, that the appeal should be dismissed and the intervention maintained.\nPer Curiam: On the merits of the intervention, the respondent was justified in claiming title to the property.\nPer Rinfret C.J., and Cartwright J.: The question as to whether an intervention of the nature of the one in the present case should fall ipso facto when the main action is dismissed is merely a question of practice and procedure, and there are here none of the special circumstances which would warrant this Court in changing its invariable practice not to interfere in such a matter.\nPer Taschereau and Rand JJ.: The intervention in the present case determines the substantive right of the respondent to have its aggressive intervention declared well-founded notwithstanding the dismissal of the main action. Such an intervention, in contradistinction with the ordinary accessory intervention, does not necessarily suffer the fate of the main action; it is, therefore, more than merely a question of practice and procedure.\nPer Kellock J.: The contention that the intervention was not the proper way for the respondent to proceed involves merely a question of procedure.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the decision of the Superior Court and holding that the intervention made in this case did not fall with the dismissal of the main action. Ubald Boisvert for the appellant. The deed was a true lease and nothing more. After the fulfilment of the conditions of the lease, the respondent would stop paying rent but would still have to pay the taxes and the maintenance. It would become the owner but title would remain in the hands of the appellant as trustee, since the respondent has not the legal capacity to acquire property.\nTo deal with the respondent's intervention, one must consider it as an action for conveyance of title, and if the tender is insufficient, as it is in this case, the procedure in conveyance must fail. Furthermore, having been filed before the incorporation of the respondent, the intervention is null.\nThe lease has the character of absolute voidness ab initio since the council has never been incorporated, is not a civil person and has no legal status. According to Art. 984 C.C., in order for a bilateral contract to be valid, both parties signing up to it must have a legal capacity to do so. Owing to the fact that the council never had a legal capacity to enter into a contract, it never was in a position to give a legal consent to the lease. And chaper 99 of 12 George VI cannot have the effect of giving validity to a lease void ab initio.\nL. E. Beaulieu, Q.C., and P. Ferland, Q.C., for the respondent. This is a matter of practice and procedure and following its jurisprudence on such a matter, this Court should not reverse the Court of Appeal.\nIn the aggressive intervention, the intervenant claims the right which is disputed between the two parties as his own. In the conservatory intervention, the intervenant takes sides with one of the parties and his intervention naturally follows the result of the action.\nThis is an aggressive intervention. In France and in Quebec, it may survive irrespective of the destiny of the action if that action is dismissed, except for a nullity ab initio (which is not the case here). The action was not null but simply defective because every member should have been sued.\nThe intervention was well-founded. The tender was sufficient to cover all that was due as far as the appellant permitted the respondent to find put what was due. The appellant is estopped from contending that the tender was not sufficient since he refused to give the information. All the obligations of the deed were fulfilled.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Cartwright J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: Je ne puis voir dans cet appel qu'une question de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure.\nJe ne trouve pas n\u00e9cessaire d'exposer les faits de la cause, qui sont d'ailleurs assez compliqu\u00e9s.\nIl suffit de mentionner que l'appelante s'est port\u00e9e demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire dire et d\u00e9clarer qu'un certain bail fait et pass\u00e9 le 24 octobre 1938 entre elle et le Conseil Maisonneuve n\u00b0 1787 de l'Ordre des Chevaliers de Colomb \u00e9tait nul \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nCe bail \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 uniquement par Lucien B\u00e9liveau et Ambroise Gagnon. En cons\u00e9quence, l'action \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e uniquement contre ces deux messieurs.\nLucien B\u00e9liveau s'en rapporta \u00e0 la justice en d\u00e9clarant qu'il n'entendait pas contester la poursuite de l'appelante. Ambroise Gagnon produisit une d\u00e9fense o\u00f9 il all\u00e9guait, entre autres, qu'en signant le bail (qui \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une promesse de vente) il n'avait agi que comme le mandataire du Conseil Maisonneuve des Chevaliers de Colomb, qu'il avait d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 son mandat \u00e0 l'appelante et qu'il n'existait aucun lien de droit entre lui et cette derni\u00e8re.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance fut d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait manifeste que l'action \u00e9tait \"dirig\u00e9e contre deux mandataires connus comme tels de la demanderesse. Il est incontestable qu'au temps de cette Convention, le Conseil de Maisonneuve n\u00b0 1787 des Chevaliers de Colomb n'\u00e9tait pas incorpor\u00e9 tel que le croyaient les deux parties \u00e0 l'acte, et que ce groupement, comme tel, n'avait aucune existence juridique\".\nC'est pour cette seule raison que l'action contre les d\u00e9fendeurs originaires devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e, vu que la demande \u00e9tait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e et que les vices dont elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e la frappaient de nullit\u00e9 ab initio (Chalifoux v. C\u00f4t\u00e9 2). En cons\u00e9quence, sur le plaidoyer du d\u00e9fendeur Gagnon, l'action fut rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. Mais, dans l'intervalle, les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9s en corporation par l'acte sp\u00e9cial de la L\u00e9gislature provinciale sanctionn\u00e9 le 11 mars 1948 (n.b. l'action contre les mandataires \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 27 janvier 1948) sont intervenus dans la cause, et, apr\u00e8s avoir fait recevoir leur intervention, conclurent \u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils avaient pleinement satisfait et au-del\u00e0 aux conditions stipul\u00e9es dans la Convention du 24 octobre 1938 pour devenir propri\u00e9taires absolus des immeubles d\u00e9crits dans l'intervention et qui faisaient l'objet de cette Convention, et demand\u00e8rent qu'il soit constat\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient devenus les propri\u00e9taires absolus depuis le 14 octobre 1947. Avec l'intervention ils consignaient en Cour un montant de $4,009.25, sauf \u00e0 parfaire si besoin \u00e9tait, et ils demandaient que leurs offres soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es valables, suffisantes et lib\u00e9ratoires; que l'appelante fut condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 leur passer titre suivant la Convention de promesse de vente dont il s'agit, faute de quoi, que le jugement \u00e0 intervenir \u00e9quivaille \u00e0 titre au profit des intervenants \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nLa Cour de premi\u00e8re instance ne se pronon\u00e7a pas sur le m\u00e9rite de l'intervention. Elle fut d'avis que, comme la demande principale \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e, l'intervention devait tomber avec elle et elle l'a rejet\u00e9e sans frais, tout en r\u00e9servant les recours de l'intervenante.\nIl n'y eut pas d'appel sur l'action principale. Seuls les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve en appel\u00e8rent du jugement. Il ne s'agissait donc plus que de savoir si, en vertu de la proc\u00e9dure dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le renvoi de la demande principale devait entra\u00eener ipso facto le rejet de l'intervention.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 3, d\u00e9cida que non et faisant droit \u00e0 l'appel elle statua que l'intervention devait \u00eatre maintenue. Ce jugement fut unanime.\nIl s'ensuit que sur la question que seul a d\u00e9cid\u00e9e le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, \u00e0 savoir que l'intervention tombait par le fait m\u00eame que l'action principale avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, la Cour d'appel fut d'avis contraire et elle proc\u00e9da \u00e0 maintenir les conclusions de l'intervention.\nA mon avis, cette question de savoir si, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu du Code de Proc\u00e9dure, une intervention du genre de celle qui est maintenant devant nous tombe ipso facto d\u00e8s que l'action principale est rejet\u00e9e est uniquement une question de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure. Or, il est de la jurisprudence invariable de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada qu'en pareille mati\u00e8re \"although having an appellate jurisdiction, the Supreme Court will not exercise it in matters relating to the practice and procedure of the Courts below except under special circumstances.\"\nNous ne discernons aucune circonstance sp\u00e9ciale dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise. Le savant procureur de l'appelante n'en a pas mentionn\u00e9 et nous ne voyons aucune raison pour que cette Cour se d\u00e9partisse de sa pratique constante et invariable (Voir Cameron\u2014\"Supreme Court Practice and Rules\", 3e \u00e9d., p. 77 et suivantes, o\u00f9 toute la s\u00e9rie des d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour est collationn\u00e9e).\nL'effet de notre jugement sur cette question n'est pas que nous nous pronon\u00e7ons dans le sens de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ou dans celui de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi; il est seulement que, \u00e9tant d'avis qu'il s'agit d'une question de proc\u00e9dure, nous suivons la jurisprudence traditionnelle de la Cour Supr\u00eame de ne pas intervenir dans les arr\u00eats des Cours d'appel provinciales en mati\u00e8re de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure.\nNous devons donc maintenant proc\u00e9der \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le m\u00e9rite de l'intervention des intim\u00e9s.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi l'a envisag\u00e9e comme ce qu'elle a appel\u00e9 une intervention agressive. En effet, ses conclusions ne se bornent pas \u00e0 demander le rejet de l'action principale. Apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 acte des offres au montant de $4,009.25, sauf \u00e0 parfaire, que les intim\u00e9s ont consign\u00e9es au greffe de la Cour, elle demande que, ces offres \u00e9tant d\u00e9clar\u00e9es valables, suffisantes et lib\u00e9ratoires, il soit statu\u00e9 que les intervenants ont pleinement satisfait et audel\u00e0 aux conditions stipul\u00e9es dans la Convention du 24 octobre 1938 pour qu'ils deviennent propri\u00e9taires absolus des immeubles dont il est question dans la cause; que, de fait, ils en sont devenus les propri\u00e9taires, ainsi que tous les membres qui font partie des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, et ce depuis le 14 octobre 1947; que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 passer titre aux demandeurs, suivant la Convention susdite, et qu'il soit enjoint \u00e0 cette Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de signer, dans un d\u00e9lai imparti, l'acte de vente produit avec la d\u00e9claration, ou tout autre acte au m\u00eame effet, faute de quoi, le jugement \u00e0 intervenir \u00e9quivaudra \u00e0 titre au profit des intervenants, \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nL'intervention contient une conclusion subsidiaire r\u00e9clamant un montant de $305.15 que la Cour du Banc du Roi n'a pas cru devoir accorder.\nLa question de proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9e, il convient de statuer sur les conclusions ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es et c'est ce qu'a fait la Cour d'Appel en d\u00e9clarant les offres et consignations des intervenants bonnes, valables et suffisantes et en ordonnant \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e de signer, en faveur des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, l'acte de vente produit avec l'intervention, avant le 15 juin 1951, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le jugement \u00e9quivaudra \u00e0 l'acte de vente.\nA vrai dire, ce r\u00e9sultat ne pouvait offrir le moindre doute, car lorsque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e, le 4 mai 1939, acheta l'immeuble dont il est question, elle le faisait pour le compte des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e, au sein du groupe connu sous le nom de Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, que dans le but d'acqu\u00e9rir l'immeuble dont le Conseil \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 locataire et de le transmettre ensuite aux intervenants d\u00e8s que certaines formalit\u00e9s auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. Mais les intervenants n'avaient pas encore, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9s en corporation; ils ne l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 que par une loi sanctionn\u00e9e le 11 mars 1948, et c'est \u00e0 la suite de cette incorporation qu'ils ont produit leur intervention.\nAux termes m\u00eames de la loi qui les incorporait, les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve \u00e9taient investis de tous les droits que le Conseil poss\u00e9dait depuis 1935, s'il avait eu alors la personnalit\u00e9 juridique et notamment des droits pouvant r\u00e9sulter de la Convention du 24 octobre 1938.\nL'attitude adopt\u00e9e par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e a donc un caract\u00e8re quelque peu ironique lorsqu'au lieu de se conformer \u00e0 cette Convention par laquelle elle servait de truchement pour les intervenants, elle entreprit de contester l'intervention et s'est refus\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00e9der l'immeuble aux Chevaliers de Maisonneuve. Il a pu y avoir certaines obligations mises \u00e0 la charge du Conseil par la Convention du 24 octobre 1938 qui n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies \u00e0 la lettre pendant que le Conseil lui-m\u00eame, pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de la corporation constitu\u00e9e par la loi du 11 mars 1948, avait la jouissance de l'immeuble, mais jamais la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e ne s'en est plainte qu'\u00e0 la fin de janvier 1948. Il \u00e9tait alors manifestement trop tard pour protester contre un \u00e9tat de choses qu'on avait non seulement tol\u00e9r\u00e9, mais auquel on avait m\u00eame particip\u00e9, comme le fait remarquer l'honorable Juge Pratte rendant le jugement pour la Cour.\nSuivant la Convention, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e \u00e9mit des certificats d'obligations qui ne devaient \u00eatre vendus qu'\u00e0 des membres des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve et dont le produit devait servir \u00e0 payer, en partie au moins, le prix d'achat de l'immeuble. Les intervenants s'engag\u00e8rent \u00e0 racheter ces certificats \u00e0 compter de 1940, \u00e0 raison de au moins $800 par ann\u00e9e. Telle fut la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par les parties pour permettre aux intervenants d'obtenir un titre \u00e0 l'immeuble.\nLa Cour d'appel en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que sans aucun doute, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, les intervenants ont pay\u00e9 plus qu'il n'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour acquitter les obligations assum\u00e9es par eux. La seule querelle de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e semble \u00eatre qu'au lieu de racheter les certificats directement de leurs d\u00e9tenteurs, les offres des intervenants furent faites \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame.\nIl y a toutefois ceci \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer: D\u00e8s le mois d'avril 1947, le Conseil offrit aux d\u00e9tenteurs d'obligations de leur racheter leurs certificats. Neuf seulement des cinquante-huit obligataires se sont pr\u00e9valus de cette offre et le Conseil les a imm\u00e9diatement pay\u00e9s; les autres ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\nLe Conseil demanda alors \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de lui donner la liste des obligataires, mais cette tentative demeura sans r\u00e9sultat. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que le Conseil offrit \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, par minist\u00e8re de notaire, un montant suffisant pour les payer, bien qu'il ne se consid\u00e9ra pas tenu de ce faire. Il n'est pas inutile de faire remarquer que les d\u00e9tenteurs d'obligations et les actionnaires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e \u00e9taient tous des membres du Conseil, en sorte que le pr\u00e9sent litige a tous les caract\u00e8res d'une querelle intestine. Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de gens qui\n[Page 463\nse poursuivent eux-m\u00eames. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en faisant valoir ses pr\u00e9tentions, ne fait, en somme, rien autre chose que d'exciper du droit d'autrui. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de ces actions et obligations ne sont pas devant la Cour personnellement et s'ils n'ont pas cru bon de profiter des dispositions des intervenants, l'on se demande en vertu de quel droit la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame serait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 s'en plaindre. Les intervenants la mettent en possession des montants requis pour satisfaire les actionnaires et les obligataires. Elle est contrainte d'agir ainsi par le refus de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de fournir aux intervenants la liste de ses actionnaires et obligataires. Elle est elle-m\u00eame la cause qui a forc\u00e9 les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve \u00e0 proc\u00e9der de cette fa\u00e7on. Nous ne pouvons voir comment elle pourrait s'y objecter valablement. Si quelqu'un pouvait le faire, ce serait les actionnaires et les obligataires eux-m\u00eames et non pas la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nComme la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous croyons que la conclusion s'impose que les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, qui sont aux droits du Conseil et, en particulier, \u00e0 ceux qui ont fait l'objet de la Convention du 24 octobre 1938, sont bien fond\u00e9s \u00e0 exiger un titre aux biens qu'ils ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par leur intervention.\nPour les raisons d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9es par l'honorable Juge Pratte, au nom de la Cour du Banc du Roi, et dont les pr\u00e9sentes ne sont que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, nous sommes d'avis que le jugement dont est appel doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion que les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, qui sont aux droits du Conseil, et en particulier \u00e0 ceux qui ont fait l'objet de la Convention du 24 octobre 1938, sont bien fond\u00e9s \u00e0 exiger un titre aux biens qu'ils ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par leur intervention.\nJ'ai eu l'avantage de lire les raisons donn\u00e9es par le Tr\u00e8s Honorable Juge en chef. Je m'accorde avec ses conclusions, mais, avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne crois pas que l'intervention du genre de celle qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, pr\u00e9sente uniquement une question de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure sur laquelle cette Cour refuse g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'intervenir. L'intervention produite par les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve n'est pas une simple intervention accessoire, faite dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'une des parties, qui doit tomber n\u00e9cessairement quand l'action principale est rejet\u00e9e (Quebec Railway v. Montcalm Land 4). Elle a un caract\u00e8re tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent. Les intervenants en effet ne soutiennent les droits de personne, mais au contraire, ils revendiquent les leurs: ils r\u00e9clament la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble en question, et demandent qu'un titre leur soit consenti. L'intervention est donc agressive et ne doit pas subir n\u00e9cessairement le sort de l'action principale. Vide Morrison v. Morrison 5.\nIl y a donc \u00e0 mon sens plus qu'une simple question de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure, mais bien la d\u00e9termination du droit substantif des intervenants, au cours d'une instance valide, de faire d\u00e9clarer bien fond\u00e9e leur intervention agressive, dans laquelle ils r\u00e9clament la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un immeuble, malgr\u00e9 le rejet de l'action principale.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nKellock, J.\u2014I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that this appeal fails on the merits. I am further of opinion that the remaining contention of the appellant involves, in the present case, merely a question of procedure without any special circumstances inviting the interference of this court.\nHad the Court of Appeal agreed with the learned trial judge that the intervention fell to the ground with the principal action, such a judgment would have left the respondent free to litigate its claims under the lease in an independent proceeding in which all question as to the right or obligation of the respondent to proceed by way of intervention would have been chose jug\u00e9e. Accordingly, all that is involved in the present appeal, so far as the contention now under consideration is concerned, is that the rights of the parties ought to have been determined in a different proceeding from the one before the court. This, I think, brings the matter within the well settled rule referred to by my Lord. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: U.

Roy (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: May 15, 16; 1952: June 30.\nPresent: Kerwin, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nVendor and Purchaser\u2014Contract for Sale of Land\u2014Repudiation by Vendor\u2014Purchaser\u2019s right upon anticipatory breach to immediately sue for declaratory judgment and specific performance\u2014The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 15(b).\nBy a written agreement made on November 29, 1949, the appellant agreed to sell to the respondent, who agreed to purchase, certain lands in Toronto, the sale to be completed on or before January 29, 1950. On December 5, 1949, the appellant repudiated the contract. On December 14, 1949, the respondent by letter denied his right to do so and before the date fixed for completion issued a writ claiming a declaration that the contract was binding and enforceable and ought to be specifically performed.\nThe action was defended on the ground that the appellant had been induced by false representations to execute the agreement, that the document was incomplete as a contract with respect to material matters, that it was ambiguous, uncertain and that there was no memorandum in writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. These issues were decided against the respondent at the trial and in the Court of Appeal. The appellant contended that the action having been brought before the day fixed for completion was premature and that the respondent\u2019s claim, if any, was for damages only.\nHeld: (Dismissing the appeal), that the defences pleaded by the appellant failed. Since the respondent had claimed a declaratory judgment that there was in existence a binding and enforceable agreement, the action was not prematurely brought. The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 15(b). The dictum in Roberto v. Bumb [1943] O.R. 299 at 310, disapproved if it was intended to mean that at the time of the issue of the writ the plaintiff did not have a complete cause of action for a declaration that the agreement was a binding contract and that it ought to be specifically enforced. Comment as to last sentence in Halsbury vol. 31, para. 468.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[1] affirming a judgment of Wells J.[2] decreeing specific performance of a contract for the sale of land and awarding damages.\nR.M.W. Chitty Q.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff having sued upon an anticipatory breach is not entitled to a decree of specific performance. The law is clear and has not been challenged since 1853, that where prior to the time for performance of a contract one party has stated to the other that he does not intend to carry out the contract, the latter may choose to treat the contract as broken and sue immediately upon the breach, or he may refuse to accept the attempted repudiation and continue to treat the contract as subsisting and when the time for performance arrives, if it is not completed owing to the other party\u2019s default, sue for the breach. 31 Hals. 2nd ed. p. 401, para. 468; Mersey Steel & Iron Co. v. Naylor[3]. When the defendant, the vendor, notified the plaintiff of its refusal to perform, the plaintiff has the choice of treating that as a breach of contract and suing immediately or he could refuse to accept the anticipatory breach and wait until the time for performance arrived, and if the contract was then subsisting, put the defendant to his election to perform by tendering, and if the defendant defaulted then treat that failure to perform as a breach and then sue. In each case the cause of action is the same, for breach of contract, but the breach is entirely different in the two cases. Therefore when the plaintiff was notified of the defendant\u2019s refusal to perform, he was put to his election whether to accept the anticipatory breach and sue without waiting or wait for the later breach, if it should occur, and make that the ground for his cause of action. Having unequivocally elected to sue upon the anticipatory breach, he cannot be heard to say that the contract was not then broken: Scarf v. Jardine[4] per Lord Blackburne at 360-1. The fact that the plaintiff did not claim the relief appropriate to an action for anticipatory breach cannot prevent his act in suing from being an unequivocal acceptance of the defendant\u2019s repudiation. He only had an action at the time if the contract had been broken. In order to sue he had to found his action on a breach of the contract. Miller v. Allen[5]. The Court of Appeal relies upon Roberto v. Bumb[6]. In that case it was only argued that the action was, at most, premature. The action was much more than premature. The plaintiff has only one cause of action for breach of the contract. The breach entitling the plaintiff to specific performance is a failure to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract when the time for performance has arrived and when the defendant has been properly put to his election to perform or default by making a proper tender upon him. If no tender is made the contract is at an end. Brickles v. Snell[7]. Until there has been a failure to perform under those circumstances there is no breach and no cause of action. If, before that time arrives and that breach occurs, the plaintiff sues, it is to be presumed that he had a cause of action and where there has been an anticipatory breach and the plaintiff has elected to sue by reason of it, that anticipatory breach must be his cause of action. It is the only cause of action he can show to support his action. If his action was only premature he might have discontinued before the time for performance arrived and then properly put the defendant to its election to perform or default. He did not do so and the time for performance having passed without his doing so, his action for specific performance is gone. Brickles v. Snell, supra. Jacta est alea. His action is much more than premature, he has exhausted his cause of action for breach of the contract. The right to sue upon an anticipatory breach is a legal remedy. Specific performance is an extraordinary remedy in equity. The remedy is not available in law and is only granted in equity upon strict terms which must exist for it to be available because equity follows the law. 13 Hals. 2nd ed. p. 83.\nThere is no suggestion in any of the long line of cases that since 1853 have developed the right to sue for anticipatory breach, that such a breach can found an action for specific performance. Statements in the cases are unequivocably against such a suggestion. See particularly the judgment of Lord Atkinson in British & Benningtons Ltd. v. N.W. Cachar Tea Co.[8] quoted by Wells J. In Fry on Specific Performance 6th ed. p. 497, para. 1062, an anticipatory breach is only mentioned as giving a right to recission. Specific performance ought not to be decreed on the following grounds\u2014(a) the contract was not complete; (b) performance of the whole contract cannot be enforced; (c) mistake; (d) the plaintiff made no tender. As to (a) the contract provides for the closing of the transaction on or before Jan. 29, the defendant to give possession on or before May 31 and to pay the plaintiff between closing and May 31, $641.75 per month for the space occupied by the defendant. The contract does not provide for any of the terms of the defendant\u2019s tenacy, nor for who was to heat the premises, pay the expenses of up-keep, electricity, water and gas, nor which of the parties would be entitled to the rents from the tenants during that period.\nThe Court can only grant specific performance of the whole contract. Fry on Specific Performance, 6th Ed. p. 383, para. 821, and since parts of it cannot now be performed the plaintiff should be confined to the remedy of damages by reason of the repudiation by the defendant. The plaintiff having sued before the time for completion of the sale, the defendant was never a tenant of the plaintiff\u2019s. The extent of the defendant\u2019s obligations as tenant were not defined by the contract and had never been agreed upon. The extent, therefore, of the extra obligations imposed on the defendant as owner in possession cannot be ascertained and the Court is not in a position to enforce performance of the whole contract as it is not able to adjust the rights between the parties in respect of that part of the contract entitling the defendant to a lease of the building after completion. To enforce performance of the whole contract the Court must imply many terms upon which the parties were not ad idem. The Court will not imply terms unless it is driven to the conclusion that they must be implied: Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[9], or that they were left out because they were so obvious: Shirlaw v. Southern Founderies[10].\nThe contract was entered into by the defendant under a mistake sufficient to deprive the plaintiff of his remedy by way of specific performance. The evidence of White shows that he discussed with the plaintiff a tentative arrangement whereby if the defendant was unable to find suitable premises to move to before May 31 that it could remain on in the building being bought and that the plaintiff implied there would be no difficulty in entering into an arrangement of the kind desired by the defendant but that immediately after the agreement had been entered into the plaintiff advertised the whole building for rent. If the plaintiff had taken this stand before the contract was made, the defendant would not have entered into it. In its pleading the defendant sets up this as a misrepresentation, but does not need to go that far: 31 Hals. 2nd ed. p. 378, para. 432, and this is particularly so if a mistake made by the defendant is contributed to by anything done by the plaintiff. Jones v. Rimmer[11]. The plaintiff made no tender but tender is necessary for two purposes, to show the readiness of the tenderor to perform and to put the tenderee to his election to perform or refuse to perform. McDonald v. Murray[12]; Snider v. Snider[13]. Here the plaintiff cannot approbate the repudiation to excuse tender and reprobate the repudiation to claim specific performance.\n(At the close of the appellant\u2019s argument the respondent was told by the Court that he need only argue on the appellant\u2019s first point.)\nF.A. Brewin Q.C. and R. Scott for the respondent. The facts of this case make it abundantly clear that the respondent upon the appellant\u2019s announced intention to repudiate the contract, did not elect to treat the contract as at an end, and sue for damages, but did elect to treat the contract as binding and at once invoked the assistance of the Court to enforce it. See correspondence between the respondent\u2019s and appellant\u2019s solicitors. The respondent has throughout these proceedings insisted that the contract was a binding contract. It is true that as the respondent has elected to treat the contract as valid and binding, that this would enable the other party to complete the contract and notwithstanding his repudiation of it to take advanage of any supervening circumstances which would justify him in declining to complete it. The facts of the case, however, indicate clearly that the appellant has made no effort or pretence at completing the contract and that there have been no intervening circumstances which would justify the appellant in declining to complete it. The respondent is only required to allege and prove as he has done, his willingness and readiness to complete. He is not bound to do further and to do a nugatory act such as tendering the purchase money which the appellant has already indicated he will not accept. Jones v. Barkley[14]. The appellant has not pleaded failure to tender as a defence, and if he did it would be met by the fact that tender is waived in the correspondence between the solicitors above referred to and the conduct of the parties.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKERWIN J.:\u2014By a written agreement dated November 29, 1949, the appellant agreed to sell and the respondent agreed to purchase certain lands and premises, and the sale was to be completed on or before January 29, 1950. On December 5, 1949, the appellant telegraphed to the respondent that it repudiated the contract, and on December 14, the respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote the solicitors for the appellant denying the latter\u2019s right to repudiate. On January 10, 1950, the writ of summons in this action was issued and the statement of claim delivered on January 17. It was argued that, admitting the respondent could immediately take advantage of the appellant\u2019s anticipatory breach and sue before the time fixed for completion, he could do so only on the basis that the contract was at an end, and he would, therefore, be confined to an action for damages for breach of contract. It was said that on the date of the writ, January 10, the respondent had no cause of action in the sense of being able to ask (as he did) for a declaration that the agreement of November 29 was a binding contract and that it ought to be specifically performed and carried into effect. That, of course, it may be observed is one of the usual claims in an action for specific performance and the judgment follows the claim.\nNo authority has been cited for the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant and we find it untenable. It is settled that an action may be brought upon an anticipatory repudiation of a contract (Fry on Specific Performance, 6th ed. para. 1062), and in paragraph 1311 of Williston on Contracts it is said:\u2014\nBut would a court, it may be asked, grant specific performance on January 1, of the contract to convey Blackacre the following July, on the ground that the defendant had been guilty of an anticipatory repudiation on the earlier day? If such repudiation is an actual breach justifying an action at law, there seems no reason why a suit in equity should not be maintainable. Certainly no decree would require performance before July 1, and it would at least be made clear that repudiation does not accelerate the obligations of a contract.\nWith that statement we agree. The argument of the appellant overlooks the power of the Court to make a declaratory judgment: Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 15(b). Although it was submitted that the point had not been advanced in Roberto v. Bumb[15], in the same manner as here, Laidlaw J.A. in that case did say, at page 310: \u201cThe cause of action was not complete when the proceedings were commenced in the Court\u201d, and, at page 311: \u201cI think that a court of equity would not permit an appellant to avoid the contract merely because the action was started prematurely, nor would the respondent be thus deprived of his equitable right to a decree of specific performance, if he were otherwise entitled to it.\u201d If these extracts mean merely that at the time of the issue of the writ the Court could not have ordered that specific performance be carried out immediately, no objection may be found with them; but if they mean that the plaintiff did not have a complete cause of action for a declaration that the agreement was a binding contract and that it ought to be specifically enforced, we are unable to agree. The plaintiff having that right, the agreement would be carried out when the time for completion had expired.\nThe last sentence in paragraph 468 of Halsbury, volume 31, \u201cin such cases neither party can claim specific performance\u201d can only refer to the earlier part of the paragraph where it is stated that if one party has evinced an intention no longer to be bound by a contract, the other party is entitled to treat that as a repudiation and to accept it as such. If it means more, it cannot be supported.\nThe respondent was not put to any election upon the receipt of the telegram of December 5, 1949, and he has consistently taken the position that the appellant could not repudiate while the appellant has continued to aver that it was entitled so to do. The respondent\u2019s right to ask the Court for a declaration of validity and to specifically perform the contract arose immediately and nothing intervened before the date fixed for completion of the contract to change the position of the parties. The respondent was a party to a contract with the appellant which the latter had definitely stated it would not carry out and, therefore, it is not a case of a plaintiff not being able to show an actual existing interest in the subject-matter at the date of the issue of the writ. It is of some significance and assistance that a vendor may bring an action for specific performance, and the inquiry as to title is whether he can make a good title and not whether he could do so at the date of the contract and, therefore, when once the inquiry has been directed, he may make out his title at any time before the certificate (Fry, paragraph 1366).\nThe contract between the parties was complete and without uncertainty. Performance of the whole contract could be enforced, and it must not be forgotten that by the time of the trial, the appellant had been in possession during the period for which it was to have a lease under the terms of the contract. Both Courts below have found that there was no mistake, and nothing was shown on the argument to cause us to think that that conclusion is not the right one on the evidence. A tender was not required when as was apparent from the actions of the appellant and from the proceedings and evidence at the trial, the appellant never intended to perform the contract. It is not necessary in connection with any of these points to refer to the clause in the contract:\u2014\nIt is agreed that there is no representation, warranty, collateral agreement or condition affecting this agreement or the real property or supported there by other than is expressed herein in writing.\nFinally, as to the suggestion that damages would be sufficient because it is contended that the plaintiff desired to use the property as an investment, it is sufficient to say that generally speaking, specific performance applies to agreements for the sale of lands as a matter of course.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16] dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Wells, J.[17] by which specific performance of a contract for the sale of land was decreed. The evidence of the contract between the parties is contained in an undated written offer made by the respondent to the appellant on November 29, 1949, which was accepted in writing by the latter on that date in the following terms:\u2014\nI hereby accept the above offer and agree to duly carry out the same on the terms thereof.\nThe property thus agreed to be sold was a parcel of land situate on the north side of Wellington Street East in the City of Toronto: the stipulated price was the sum of $52,500 which was to be paid in part by the assumption of a first mortgage registered against the property and the balance in cash on the closing of the transaction. Other terms provided that the respondent might remain in possession of part of the premises for a stated period upon payment of a stipulated monthly rental, that the purchaser was to examine the title at his own expense and to have fifteen days from the date of the acceptance of the offer for that purpose, and included the usual provision for the adjustment of taxes, interest and other such matters as of the date of the completion of the sale which was to be on or before January 29, 1950. The matter of the completion of the sale was referred by the respective parties to their solicitors and by letter dated December 3, 1949, the solicitors for the appellant wrote to the solicitors for the respondent enclosing a draft deed of the property, asked for particulars as to the grantee and said that a statement of adjustments would follow in due course.\nThe appellant, however, thereafter decided not to carry out the agreement and on December 5, 1949, sent a telegram to the respondent in the following terms:\u2014\nWe repudiate contract for sale of premises 44-50 Wellington Street East on grounds of want of mutuality.\nOn the day following, the appellant\u2019s solicitors wrote the solicitors for the respondent confirming that this telegram had been sent and asked for the return of the draft which had been enclosed with their letter of December 3rd. On December 13, 1949, the solicitors for the respondent wrote the solicitors for the appellant making requisitions as to title. On the day following they wrote again acknowledging the letter of December 6th and insisted that the contract was binding on the parties and said:\u2014\nYou might advise us if you waive tender and we can get on with an action for specific performance.\nThe only written answer to these last communications was a letter from the solicitors for the appellant, saying that they had authority to accept service of any writ that the solicitors for the respondent were instructed to issue. No tender of a conveyance was made by the respondent to the appellant and the action was commenced in advance of January 29, 1950, the date fixed for the completion of the sale.\nBy the statement of claim the respondent claimed:\na declaration that the said contract made between the plaintiff and the defendant on the 29th day of November, 1949, is a binding contract between the plaintiff and the defendant for the sale to the plaintiff of the lands and premises mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof, for the price set out in the said contract and that the same ought to be specifically performed and carried into effect.\nand that the matter be referred to the Master to take the accounts, including an account of the damages suffered by reason of what was called the defendant\u2019s repudiation of the contract.\nThe defences pleaded were that the defendant had been induced by false representations to execute the agreement, that the document was incomplete as a contract with respect to material matters, that it was ambiguous and uncertain with respect to the terms of the defendant\u2019s tenancy thereof and that there was no memorandum in writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nWells J. by whom the action was tried found against the present appellant on each of these issues and also upon two further questions argued before him, namely, that by bringing the action in advance of the date fixed for the completion of the contract the plaintiff had elected to accept the repudiation of the contract by the defendant and was at best only entitled to damages and that the action for specific performance was premature.\nThe formal judgment entered pursuant to these findings declared that the agreement made between the parties was a binding contract and ought to be specifically performed and carried into effect, and included the usual directions as to the taking of the account and reserved further directions until after the Master should have made his report.\nThe Court of Appeal concurred in the conclusions of the learned trial judge. In delivering the judgment of the Court, Laidlaw J.A. said in part that Wells J. had properly given effect to a clause in the contract reading:\u2014\nIt is agreed that there is no representation, warranty, collateral agreement or condition affecting this agreement or the real property or supported hereby (sic) other than is expressed herein in writing.\nin dealing with the issues of misrepresentation and of mistake. The reasons delivered at the trial, however, appear to me to make it clear that in dealing with these issues Wells J. based his conclusions on his acceptance of the evidence of the defendant. It is, therefore, unnecessary, in my opinion, to express any view as to the effect of this term of the contract in the circumstances of this case. In dealing with the argument that the action, in so far as the claim was for specific performance was premature, Laidlaw J.A. in finding against this contention followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Roberto v. Bumb[18]. While I respectfully agree with the conclusions of the Court of Appeal upon the various questions arising for decision in the present matter, I disagree with the opinion expressed in Roberto\u2019s case that an action for specific performance brought before the date fixed for the completion of the transaction by the parties is premature.\nIt is of importance to note that in the present matter, in addition to the claim for specific performance, the respondent asked for a declaration that the contract was binding upon the parties. To make such a declaration of right is expressly authorized by subsection (b) of s. 15 of the Judicature Act (c. 190, R.S.O. 1950), whether any consequential relief is or could be claimed or not. The section of the Ontario Act reproduces verbatim r. 5 of Order XXV of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883, under which it has been held that the making of such a declaration is not confined to cases where the plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendant (Guarantee Trust Co. v. Hannay[19]; Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v. British Bank for Foreign Trade[20], Lord Sumner at 452). In Hanson v. Radcliffe Urban Council[21], Lord Sterndale expressed the opinion that the power of the court to make a declaration under this rule where it is a question of defining the rights of two parties is only limited by its own discretion. In the circumstances of the present case it cannot be successfully contended that in so far as a declaratory judgment was sought the action was premature.\nAs to that portion of the prayer for relief which asked a declaration that the contract \u201cought to be specifically performed and carried into effect\u201d, this was no doubt intended to be, not simply a claim for a declaration, but for the substantive relief of specific performance. As to this, it is argued that since the vendor was not bound to complete the sale until January 29th no action could be brought until a tender of conveyance had been made and there had been a refusal on the part of the vendor to convey the property on or before the named date. The terms of the telegram of December 5th and the letter of December 6th and the fact that the only answer made by the appellant\u2019s solicitors to the letter from the solicitors for the respondent of December 13th, in which they asked if the appellant waived the necessity of making a tender, was the letter of December 15th, made it clear that the appellant did not intend to carry out the agreement and that any tender would be rejected. In these circumstances none was necessary, in my opinion.\nThe argument appears to me to be based upon a misconception of the nature of the proceedings. Some support, however, for the submission that courts of equity do not interfere until the time for performance has passed and default has been made is to be found in a passage from Fry on Specific Performance (6th Ed. p. 3) where the learned author says that the court rarely, if ever, interferes until the time for performance has passed, a statement which is repeated at p. 539 of the 12th Edition of Pollock on Contracts. Opinions to the contrary are expressed in the passage from the Restatement of The Law of Contracts (Vol. 2, p. 645), referred to by the learned trial judge, and in Williston (Vol. 5, p. 3708).\nIn my opinion, the right of the respondent to resort to a court of equity for the enforcement of his rights and the protection of his interest in the land arose immediately upon receipt of the telegram of December 5th and the letter of the day following. These statements were unequivocal declarations on the part of the appellant of its intention to disregard the terms of the contract and not to complete the sale. If, in fact, there was at that time a binding and enforceable agreement for the sale of the land, the respondent was as between himself and the appellant in the eyes of a court of equity the real beneficial owner (Shaw v. Foster[22], at 338 per Lord Cairns, at p. 349 per Lord O\u2019Hagan: Lysaght v. Edwards[23], Jessel M.R. at 505; McKillop v. Alexander[24], Anglin J. at 578. In Rose v. Watson[25], Lord Westbury said that when the owner of an estate contracts for the immediate sale of land the ownership of the estate is in equity transferred by that contract.\nCourts of equity are constantly asked to intervene for the protection of contractual and other property rights. In Heathcote v. The North Staffordshire Railway Company[26], Cottenham, L.C. in contrasting the exercise of the jurisdiction in equity in respect to contracts for the sale of goods and those for the sale of land, said in part (p. 112):\nIf, indeed, A. had agreed to sell an estate to B., and then proposed to deal with the estate, so as to prevent him from performing his contract, equity would interfere, because in that case B. would by the contract have obtained an interest in the estate itself, which in the case of the goods he would not.\nIn Hadley v. The London Bank of Scotland[27], Turner L.J. said in part:\u2014\nI have always understood the rule of the Court to be, that if there is a clear valid contract for sale the Court will not permit the vendor afterwards to transfer the legal estate to a third person, although such third person would be affected by lis pendens. I think this rule well founded in principle, for the property is in Equity transferred to the purchaser by the contract, the vendor then becomes a trustee for him, and cannot be permitted to deal with the estate so as to inconvenience him.\nThe assistance of the court may be invoked to restrain by injunction a threatened breach of contract, thus in effect compelling its performance. In Kerr on Injunctions, 6th Ed. p. 411, the learned author says that it is not necessary that the breach in respect of which the interference of the court is sought should have been actually committed: it is enough that the defendant claims and insists on his right to do the act complained of, although he may not have actually done it. The court intervenes for the protection of equitable as well as legal rights (Performing Right Society v. London Theatre[28]). In the present matter the denial by the appellant of the existence of an enforceable agreement for the sale of the land was a denial of the fact that the respondent then had an equitable estate or interest in it and was as between himself and the appellant the beneficial owner: it was implicit in such an attitude that the appellant, the registered owner of the property, contended that it was at liberty to deal with the property as its own. Whether or not the defendant\u2019s attitude would have justified the respondent in bringing an action claiming an injunction to restrain any such dealing with the property, it is, in my opinion, clear that he was entitled immediately to bring an action for a declaration as to the nature of his interest and for a decree that the contract be specifically performed and to file a lis pendens against the title to the property to prevent any dealing with it, unless subject to his interest. The principles stated by Cockburn, C.J. in Frost v. Knight[29], as to the remedies at common law of a party to a contract, where the other contracting party announces in advance of the time for completion his intention not to perform it, do not appear to me to touch the question as to when the assistance of a court of equity may be sought in circumstances such as these.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slaght, McMurtry, Ganong, Keith & Slaght.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cameron, Weldon, Brewin & McCallum.\n[1] [1951] O.W.N. 774; [1952] 1 D.L.R. 158.\n[2] [1951] O.R. 366; 3 D.L.R. 122.\n[3] (1884) 9 App. Cas. 434.\n[4] (1882) 7 App. Cas. 345.\n[5] (1912) 4 O.W.N. 346.\n[6] [1943] O.R. 299.\n[7] [1916] 2 A.C. 599.\n[8] [1923] A.C. 48.\n[9] (1891) 2 Q.B. 488.\n[10] [1939] 2 All E.R. 113.\n[11] (1880) 14 Ch.

Western Fair [1951] S.C.R. 596), the translation for \"substantial\" is \"important.\"\nPer: Cartwright J. In this case the ownership of 49 per cent of the shares of the appellant constituted a substantial interest within the meaning of the words in s. 3.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court [1951] Ex. C.R. 338, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of Sidney Smith, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1 dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the respondent's assessment against it for the year 1947 under The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.\nD. K. MacTavish Q.C. and G. Perley-Robertson for the appellant. There are no facts in dispute and this whole case turns on the meaning of \"substantial interest\" in the proviso to s. 3 of The Excess Profits Tax Act. The Crown contends that one Fred Manning and his wife held all the shares but one in Manning Lumber Mills Ltd. (whose business appellant continued) and that the Mannings and the Lumber Company held 49 per cent of the shares in the appellant company. Appellant says that whatever meaning would be given the term \"substantial interest\" if it had no context, still the context here shows that in s. 3 \"substantial interest\" must mean \"main interest\" according to all established canons of construction. The Oxford Dictionary and the Century Dictionary both give one of the recognized meanings of \"substantial\" as being \"main\" or \"in the main\". Such phrases as \"substantial justice\", \"substantial completion\" show that this meaning is quite common. The Crown conceded this at the hearing, though it denied that that was the meaning here. The proviso to s. 3 itself uses the term \"substantially\" in two places and it is also found in ss. 4(2), 4A (1) (a) (i), and 5(4). \"Substantially\" being so used, this is decisive on the authorities to show that the proviso to s. 3 uses the word \"substantial\" as meaning \"main\" there being nothing to exclude this meaning. Re National Savings Bank Association 2; R. v. Poor Law Commissioners: Re St. Paneras 3 ; R. v. Poor Law Commissioners: Re Holborn Union 4 ; Brace v. Abercarn 5 ; Victoria (City) v. Bishop of Vancouver 6; Wolfe Co. v. R. 7.\nSince this is a taxation statute, some line must be found : and the only line that can be drawn is that between a major and a minor interest, between a controlling and a minority interest, which the Privy Council in M.N.R. v. Wrights Canadian Ropes Ltd. 8 fixed definitely at the 50 per cent mark.\nNot only is the term \"substantial interest\" capable of more than one meaning but despite popular usage, the factors that point to the legislature's meaning \"main interest\" in s. 3 outweigh any factors that point the other way. The appellant also relies on the principle that a taxing measure capable of more than one meaning must be construed in favour of the taxpayer. The King v. Crabbs 9; Kent v. The King 10.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent. The appellant made it clear at the hearing before the trial judge that the only point in issue is whether a 49 per cent interest was a \"substantial interest\" within the meaning of the proviso to s. 3 of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940. The word \"substantial\" has a number of quite different senses depending on the context in which it is used. This appears from an examination of the word as an adjective in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and the illustrations of its various uses given therein. Used with the indefinite article it is clear that it means \"Of ample or considerable amount\", or \"having substance; not imaginary, unreal, or apparent only; true, solid, real\". None of the other meanings given can be applied to its use in the context \"a substantial interest\". This is made clear by reference to the French version where the word used in the present context is \"important\". Compare para, (b) of s. 3 where the words in the French version corresponding to \"substantially\" in the English version are \"sensiblement\" and \"essentiellement\". The French and English versions of the Statute must be read together. Composers', Authors & Publishers Association of Canada, Ltd. v. Western Fair Association 11. It is a question of fact as to whether an interest is substantial. The word does not require any precise proportion as a matter of law. Palser v. Grinling 12. That the word in ordinary use in a context such as that here does not mean \"majority\" or \"controlling\" as urged by appellant's counsel is shown by the use of the word in the Notice of Appeal where a number of persons are stated each to have had \"substantial\" investments in the appellant company. In any event the question as to whether the same persons had a substantial interest in the appellant's business and the previous business was entrusted by Parliament to the Minister and he formed the opinion that the same persons had a substantial interest in both businesses. The question is whether \"the person or persons who has or have a substantial interest in the business \u2026 had, in the opinion of the Minister \u2026 a substantial interest in a previous business.\" (S. 3). The Minister formed that opinion. There was evidence on which he could and no ground of invalidity has been suggested. The King v. Noxema Chemical Co. of Canada Ltd. 13. The reason why this question was left for determination by the Minister is probably that Parliament did not find it possible to formulate a more precise test than that contained in the phrase a \"substantial interest\". It must be remembered that the phrase appears in a provision designed to protect the revenue against evasion by the improper use of an exemption provision in a wartime taxation statute. For the above reasons and for the reasons contained in the reasons for judgment delivered by the trial judge the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014In February, 1948, the appellant duly filed an Income and Excess Profits Tax return for the 1947 taxation year, but failed to show any excess profits tax payable. The contention is based on section 3 of The Excess Profits Tax Act, which is to the effect that a company is exempt from tax during its first year of operation, provided (a) it carried on a substantially new business with substantially new assets, (b) has started business after June 26th, 1944, unless it continued a previous business, and (c) some person or persons had a \"substantial interest\" both in the previous and in the new business.\nIt is common ground that the appellant first began business in 1947, year of its incorporation, that it continued a previous business, and it is also conceded that the Mannings who owned nearly all the shares of the previous business, held 49 per cent of the shares of the new company. The only point in issue is therefore whether a 49 per cent interest is a \"substantial interest\", within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act.\nThe appellant was assessed in the sum. of $29,458.78 and his appeals to the Minister as well as to the Exchequer Court were dismissed. The Honourable Sidney Smith, deputy judge, declined to accept the argument that \"substantial interest\" meant \"majority\" or \"controlling interest.\"\nI think that this judgment is clearly right. The word \"substantial\" has a number of quite different senses, all depending on the context in which it is used. In the present case, I agree with the submission of the respondent, that the only possible meaning that it can be given is \"large quantity\", \"considerable amount of shares\". When Parliament intended to deal with the standard profits of certain controlled companies, it used the words \"a controlling interest\", as it did in section 15a. Moreover, in the French version of section 3, which must be read with the English one (Authors & Publishers v. Western Fair 14), the translation for \"substantial\" is \"important\".\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. Cartwright J.:\u2014The appellant contends that in the phrase \"a person or persons who has or have a substantial interest in the business either by ownership of shares in the corporation or joint stock company that operates the business or otherwise,\" used in section 3 of the Excess Profits Tax Act as amended, the words \"a substantial interest\" mean \"a controlling interest\", and therefore in the case of a joint stock company, which the appellant is, \"more than half of the issued shares\". I am unable to accept this contention. I do not think that in their ordinary meaning the words \"substantial interest\" are synonymous with the words \"controlling interest\", and that Parliament did not intend so to use them is indicated by the fact that the latter words are used elsewhere in the same statute.\nI agree with the view of the learned Deputy Judge that in this case the ownership of 49 per cent of the shares of the appellant constituted a substantial interest within the meaning of the words in section 3 quoted above.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Crease, Davey, Lawson, Davis, Gordon & Baker.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

In 1940, he went overseas and while there married, in 1941, a British subject previously domiciled in the United Kingdom and, thereafter, established a matrimonial home in that country. He remained overseas until May 1946, except for a few weeks in 1941 when he returned to Canada in connection with his military duties. From the date of his marriage until May 1946, his wife and, subsequently, his children remained in the United Kingdom. In May 1946, the appellant, his wife and their children came to Canada and took up permanent residence in Ottawa where he resumed his law practice.\nDuring his absence abroad, the appellant continued as a non-active partner in a Canadian law firm and income tax returns covering partnership and investment income were filed on his behalf. During this period, he maintained a bank account and a safety deposit box in Ottawa, and his civilian clothes were stored at his parents' residence.\nIn his income tax return for 1946, the appellant sought a deduction under s. 7A(1) of the Income War Tax Act for the period of absence in 1946 on the ground that he was not previously \"resident\" or \"ordinarily resident\" in Canada in the year 1946 prior to his return in May. The Minister's disallowance of the deduction was upheld in appeals to the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed; since throughout the period in question the appellant was resident either in the army quarters or in the rented dwelling in which his wife was living, or in both, he was entitled to the deduction claimed.\nHeld: The words \"resident\" and \"ordinarily resident\" should be given the everyday meaning ascribed to them by common usage, there being no definition of these words in the Income War Tax Act.\nHeld: Even if it could be said that the residence of the appellant was throughout that period extraordinary, in the sense of being out of the usual course of his life considered as a whole, it would not follow that he had an ordinary residence in Canada; it would rather follow that he ceased to have anywhere a residence which was ordinary in the corresponding sense.\nHeld: Bearing in mind all the facts in this case and particularly that during that period the appellant was physically absent from Canada, had therein no dwelling or other place of abode to which he could as of right return and was maintaining his matrimonial home in the United Kingdom, he was not at any time during the relevant period resident or ordinarily resident in Canada. In all appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court in proceedings by way of appeal from the Income Tax Appeal Board, the reasons for judgment given by members of the Board should be included in the Appeal Case filed in the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J. 1, dismissing the appellant's appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board in respect of the appellant's 1946 assessment for income tax.\nM. H. Fyfe Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant was not during the period in question resident in Canada because he was not physically present in Canada and had no abode or place of habitation there. He was not resident, he was out of Canada. Residence implies a place of abode and personal presence.\nNot being resident in Canada, the appellant could not be ordinarily resident in Canada. Where the expressions \"resident\" and \"ordinarily resident\" are both used, the latter is narrower than the former with the result that a person who is not resident in Canada cannot be found to be ordinarily resident in Canada. If \"resident\" is given its fullest meaning, the expression ordinarily resident becomes superfluous.\nThe fact that the appellant went overseas on active service is no ground, in the circumstances, for saying that he remained ordinarily resident in Canada. Residence is to be distinguished from domicil.\nA person can be resident in more than one place, but since ordinarily resident is narrower than resident, a person can be ordinarily resident in more than one place only if his stay in each place is substantial and habitual. Having changed his whole way of life by marrying in the United Kingdom and setting up matrimonial homes there and being present there, the appellant was during the whole period ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and not in Canada.\nD. W. Mundell Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent. In the absence of a statutory definition, these words should receive the meaning given to them by common usage. The expression \"resides\" means to dwell permanently or for a considerable period of time, to have one's settled or usual abode, or to live in or at a particular place. The expression \"ordinarily\" means, amongst other things, usually, commonly, and as is normal or usual.\nIn accordance with the test in Thomson v. Minister of National Revenue 2, the question whether a person resides or ordinarily resides at a place is one of fact. Amongst the facts to be considered is the original and continuing status of the person and the general mode of his life. Continual and uninterrupted physical presence is clearly not necessary and absence for a large part of a particular tax period does not prevent a person being resident and much less ordinarily resident. Where a person is absent the question of whether his absence interrupts his ordinary residence depends on the nature and purpose of his absence\u2014whether it is to abandon his residence or is extraordinary, exceptional, temporary or accompanied by a sense of transitoriness or of return. Storage of personal belongings, maintenance of banking arrangements, the presence of an abode to which the person is free to come even though he has no proprietary interest, and the existence of family ties are all significant as indicating a retention of residence. Finally, the whole of the person's course of conduct with respect to his absence, including his conduct in returning, may be looked at to determine whether his absence resulted in his ceasing to be resident.\nUsing the language in its ordinary and popular sense, he ordinarily resided in Canada throughout this time. Canada being the appellant's ordinary residence in 1939, all factors to be considered support the view that he continued to be ordinarily resident in Canada during the period of his service in the forces. These factors demonstrate that his absence was merely temporary and deviatory and was not a change or final departure from his usual and settled mode of life.\nThe reason for the appellant's absence was that he enlisted for and went on active service in the Canadian forces at the outbreak of the war. An absence for this purpose, rather than giving rise to any inference that the appellant abandoned Canada as the place where he ordinarily resided, gives rise to an inference that Canada was to continue as his place of ordinary residence. Moreover all the other circumstances indicate that Canada continued to be the place where the appellant ordinarily resided. The ties of family between the appellant and Canada, both personal and in business, remained uninterrupted. He made arrangements to preserve, as far as possible, the continuity and pattern of his ordinary life and interests, business and social, in Canada pending his return.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Angers J. 3 pronounced on June 25, 1951, dismissing an appeal by the appellant from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board with respect to his income tax assessment for the year 1946, and disallowing the claim of the appellant that the tax payable by him for that year should be reduced by the sum of $657.\nThe question to be determined is whether between January 1, 1946 and May 8, 1946, the appellant was \"resident or ordinarily resident in Canada\" within the meaning of those words as used in section 7(a) of the Income War Tax Act. That section so far as it is relevant to this inquiry reads as follows:\u2014\n7A (1) : A Taxpayer who\n(a) not being previously resident or ordinarily resident in Canada during a taxation year becomes resident or ordinarily resident in Canada during the said taxation year, so that he neither resided nor was ordinarily resident in Canada during the whole of the taxation year, may deduct from the tax otherwise payable by him under subsection one of section nine of this Act, a portion of the said tax that bears the same relation to the whole tax as the period in the taxation year during which he neither resided nor was ordinarily resident in Canada bears to the whole taxation year.\nThe facts are as follows. Before September 2, 1939, the appellant admittedly was ordinarily resident in Canada, living at Ottawa. He was a barrister and solicitor practising in Ottawa in partnership with his brother. He was a bachelor and lived with his parents in Ottawa in circumstances to be mentioned in greater detail hereafter. The appellant was also, at this time, a member of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of Canada. He held the rank of major and was in command of a Field Battery. On the outbreak of war he volunteered for active service. He was attested in the forces on September 2, 1939 and was placed in command of a battery. From September 2, 1939, to June, 1946, the appellant was in the Canadian Active Service Force.\nOn 25th August, 1940, the appellant sailed for England arriving there on 5th September, 1940. While in England, the appellant was married on 22nd February, 1941, in Oxford, England, to a British subject previously domiciled in the United Kingdom. At that time, the appellant was attending the Staff College at Camberley, Surrey, and at the time of his marriage as aforesaid established a home for himself and his wife in a rented furnished house nearby where they lived until mid-May, 1941. At that time, he was attached for training to the 6th British Armoured Division in Cambridgeshire and he rented a furnished flat in Cambridge to which his wife moved. On September 12, 1941, under orders, he sailed from Liverpool, arriving in Halifax on 23rd September, 1941, to take up an appointment with the 5th Canadian Armoured Division at Camp Borden, Ontario. His wife remained in England and in October obtained a lease of another furnished house in Cambridge, \"Grange Croft\", Grange Road, Cambridge, which the appellant continued to rent until November, 1943. On 10th November, 1941, the appellant, under orders, sailed from Halifax with the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade for England arriving there on 23rd November, 1941.\nFrom 23rd November, 1941, until July, 1944, the appellant remained continuously in England holding a succession of appointments in the Canadian Army. On 20th January,\n1942, his son was born at \"Grange Croft\". Towards the end of November, 1943, the appellant moved his family from Cambridge to a rented furnished house in Fetcham, Surrey. On 4th May, 1944, his daughter was born in this house.\nIn July, 1944, the appellant proceeded with Headquarters First Canadian Army to the Normandy bridgehead in France. At about the same time, he moved his wife and two children from Fetcham to a rented furnished house in Lancashire. He maintained his family there until May, 1945, when he moved them to a rented furnished house in Scotland. He maintained his family there until mid-September, 1945, when he moved them back to the South of England to a rented furnished house in Watford, Hertfordshire, where he and his family lived together from mid-September, 1945, until they came to Canada in May, 1946. At the end of June, 1945, under orders of competent military authority, the appellant relinquished his appointment in the Netherlands as Brigadier, General Staff, 1st Canadian Army, and proceeded to England to take up a new appointment, as President of the Khaki University of Canada in the United Kingdom, which he held until the latter part of April, 1946.\nDuring the period from 23rd November, 1941, to the end of April, 1946, the appellant spent all his leave periods with his wife and their children in the United Kingdom at one or other of the places set out above. The appellant, his wife and their children sailed from Southampton on 4th May, 1946, and landed at Halifax on 8th May, 1946.\nWhile the appellant was overseas, the law practice in which he was a partner was carried on by salaried employees of the partnership as his partner was also overseas in the armed forces. Income tax returns were filed in Canada on behalf of the appellant by his father for the taxation years when the appellant was overseas, his father acting under a Power of Attorney from the appellant, the liability to tax being founded on section 9(1) (d) of The Income War Tax Act reading as follows:\u2014\n9(1): There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person, other than a corporation or joint stock company, . . . .\n* * *\n(d) who, not being resident in Canada, is carrying on business in Canada at any time in such year;\nOn the income tax return filed on behalf of the appellant for the year 1940 the question on the form \"Address of Present Residence?\" was answered \"9 Marlborough Ave., Ottawa, Carleton, Ontario (Overseas)\". On the returns filed on his behalf for the years 1941 to 1945, both inclusive, this question was answered either \"Cambridge, England\", \"Active Service\u2014England\" or \"Active Service Overseas\". Before he left Ottawa, the appellant was a member of the Rideau Club of Ottawa and the Royal Ottawa Golf Club, near Hull, P.Q., and throughout his service in the forces he continued to be a member of these Clubs.\nWhile overseas, the appellant maintained a bank account and a safety deposit box in a bank in Ottawa which were operated on his behalf in connection with his Canadian income and Canadian securities under Power of Attorney given to his father. While overseas the appellant continuously operated a personal bank account in a branch of a Canadian bank in London, England.\nShortly prior to the appellant proceeding with his family to Canada in May, 1946, he requested his father to endeavour to arrange for him the rental of a suitable house in the Ottawa area to which he could bring his family after their arrival and such a rental was arranged for him of a house in Rockcliffe.\nPrior to September 2, 1939, the appellant was living at the home of his parents at 9 Marlborough Avenue, Ottawa, as a roomer and boarder at an agreed monthly rate. Under this arrangement, the appellant occupied the bedroom at the rear of the second floor of the house. When the appellant volunteered for active service in September, 1939, these arrangements were terminated and the appellant's civilian clothing and personal belongings were packed away in a box room at 9 Marlborough Avenue. The appellant lived in Government quarters from 3rd September, 1939, with his unit. Shortly after the appellant had terminated his arrangements for living at 9 Marlborough Avenue, his father took over the room which the appellant had occupied and used it as his personal bedroom and dressing room and continued to do so until the year 1946. When the appellant returned to Canada on duty on 23rd September, 1941, he was granted a week-end's leave which he spent as the guest of his parents, occupying the spare guest room at 9 Marlborough Avenue.\nWhen the appellant and his family returned to Canada in May, 1946, they were invited by the appellant's parents to be their guests for a short time at 9 Marlborough Avenue. As a result of this invitation, the appellant and his wife stayed at 9 Marlborough Avenue for a period of approximately one week and occupied the spare guest room. For the remainder of the month of May, 1946 the appellant and his wife had a holiday at the Seigniory Club at Montebello, in the Province of Quebec. The appellant's two children and their nursemaid were guests of the appellant's father and mother at 9 Marlborough Avenue for approximately three weeks in May, 1946, and occupied two rooms on the third floor. On 1st June, 1946, the appellant and his family went into possession of the house which the appellant had rented in Rockcliffe.\nThe Income War Tax Act does not contain a definition of the words \"resident\" or \"ordinarily resident\" and it is common ground that they should be given the everyday meaning ascribed to them by common usage.\nThe question whether, as used in section 7(a), the words \"ordinarily resident\" are more or less comprehensive than, or synonymous with, the word \"resident\" was argued before us but it does not appear to me to be necessary to pursue this inquiry in this case. It has already received attention in Thompson v. Minister of National Revenue 4.\nIn my view, giving to the words in question the interpretation most favourable to the respondent which can be given without doing violence to their commonly accepted meaning, it is impossible to say that the appellant was at any time in the period between November 23, 1941 and the beginning of May, 1946, either resident or ordinarily resident in Canada. Throughout such period, in my opinion, he was resident either in the quarters which he was occupying for the time being in the performance of his military duties or in the rented dwelling in which his wife was living for the time being, or perhaps in both of such places, and was neither resident nor ordinarily resident in any other place.\nI have not overlooked the argument of counsel for the respondent that, as was pointed out by Kerwin J. in Thompson v. Minister of National Revenue (supra) at page 213, a person may be a resident of more than one country for revenue purposes, that war is an extraordinary occurrence, that the appellant intended to return to Canada after the war and that, therefore, his residence out of Canada during the period of several years mentioned above should be regarded as \"extraordinary\" and he should be deemed throughout such period to have been \"ordinarily resident\" in Canada. For the purposes of this argument, I am willing to assume the continuing intention of the appellant to return, although I would have thought the word \"hope\" more apt than the word \"intention\" to describe his probable state of mind in this regard. In my view, however, even if it could properly be said that the residence of the appellant was throughout the period from November 23, 1941 to May 8, 1946 extraordinary, in the sense of being out of the usual course of his life considered as a whole, it would not follow that he had during such period an ordinary residence in Canada; it would rather follow that during the years mentioned he ceased to have anywhere a residence which was ordinary in the corresponding sense.\nIt has frequently been pointed out that the decision as to the place or places in which a person is resident must turn on the facts of the particular case. Bearing in mind all the facts which are set out above, perhaps in unnecessary detail, and particularly that throughout the period in question and for several years prior thereto the appellant was physically absent from Canada, had therein no dwelling house or other place of abode to which he could as of right return and was maintaining his matrimonial home in the United Kingdom, I am of opinion that he was not at any time in such period resident or ordinarily resident in Canada.\nBefore parting with the matter I should mention a matter of practice with which counsel requested us to deal. We think that in all appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court in proceedings by way of appeal from the Income Tax Appeal Board the reasons for judgment given by members of the Board should be included in the Appeal Case filed in this Court.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and declare that the appellant is entitled to the deduction claimed. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beament, Fyfe & Ault.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. J.

His conviction was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec, the dissenting judgment holding that the evidence did not warrant a conviction and that the trial judge failed to instruct properly the jury, by omitting to review the evidence.\nHeld (Rand and Fauteux JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nPer Rinfret C.J., Taschereau and Estey JJ.: As a general rule, in the course of his charge a trial judge should review the substantial parts of the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. Where, as here, the evidence was technical and somewhat involved, it was particularly important to strip it of the non-essentials, and to present to the jury the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision, and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and by the defence. Unfortunately, this was not done here, and the explanations and grounds of defence were not adequately put before the jury. There was evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could have found the accused guilty, but since it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have been the said if the proper instructions had been given, this was, therefore, not a case for the application of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting) : In a case such as here, where the defence was plain and uncomplicated, the absence of a repetition of the few salient facts had not and could not have had the slightest influence on the minds of the jury in reaching their verdict; there was, therefore, no ground for appeal and a fortiori no substantial wrong had been done.\nPer Fauteux J. (dissenting) : The practical significance which could be attached to the opinions of the experts called for the defence was more dependent upon than promoting the credibility of the appellant's testimony. The jury disbelieved him. The case for the appellant would have been weakened rather than strengthened if the trial judge had dealt exhaustively with the expert opinions.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming, Galipeault C.J.A. dissenting, the jury's verdict of man-slaughter. J. J. Robinette Q.C. and P. B. C. Pepper for the appellant. The issue narrowed down to the proper inference to be drawn from the medical testimony. There is no doubt that the dissent was on a question of law, but should there be, it should be resolved in favour of the accused.\nThe trial judge having failed to review the evidence for the jury in such a way that they could clearly appreciate the issues involved and the evidence bearing upon each issue, this was a serious non direction amounting to misdirection. Rex v. Boak [2], Rex v. Hughes [3], Rex v. Hill [4]), Rex v. Stephen[5]) and Rex v. Arnold[6].\nThe trial judge's charge did not, as it should have, adequately put before the jury the accused's explanations and grounds of defence and the evidence in support there-of. Moreover, he should also show the weakness in the Crown's case. Rex v. Kirk [7], Brooks v. Rex[8], Rex v. Scott[9], Markadonis v. Rex[10], Wu v. Rex[11], Rex v. West[12], Rex v. Harms[13] and Rex v. Gouin [14]\nThe circumstantial evidence was far from being incon\u00adsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was the guilty person within the rule in Odge's case. Lizotte v. The King[15], Rienblatt v. The King [16]and Fraser v. The King[17].\nThe trial judge erred in admitting gynecological instru\u00adments not pertaining to the issues in the case, to the preju\u00addice of the accused. Rex v. Picken[18].\nHenri Masson-Loranger Q.C. for the respondent. In view of the very simple issue involved in this case, namely, was the haemorrhage spontaneous or caused by the appel\u00adlant, there was no need for the trial judge to review the evidence. The doctors on both sides were' in accord. No objection to the charge was made. It would have weakened the appellant's case rather than strengthened it had he done so. There was therefore no prejudice. The jurisprudence cited by the appellant must be distinguished as those were all cases where it was essential to relate the facts to a principle of law i.e., conspiracy. But the review is not necessary in a case of simple denial.\nThere is here no analogy with the case of Picken, since here we have a doctor's office regularly organized.\nThe circumstantial evidence leads indubitably to the guilt of the accused and to no other conclusion, and this beyond any reasonable doubt.\nThere was ample evidence to support the verdict and the medical evidence was not contradictory. At the very least, this is a case for the application of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.-The accused was charged with the murder of Blanche Lepire, and was found guilty of man-slaughter. It is the contention of the Crown that the appellant, for the unlawful purpose of procuring the mis-carriage of the deceased woman, used on her instruments, which eventually caused her death. The Court of Appeal[19] confirmed the verdict, Chief Justice Galipeault dissenting. He reached the conclusion that the evidence did not warrant a conviction, and that the trial judge failed to instruct properly the jury, in omitting to review the evidence, so that they could clearly appreciate the issues involved.\nAs I have come to the conclusion that there should be a new trial, I do not intend to deal with all the details of the evidence. It will be sufficient to say that I do not agree with the learned dissenting judge, that the verdict was unreasonable and unjustified. There was, I think, evidence upon which a jury could convict or acquit, whether they accepted the theory of the Crown, or were left in doubt when the defence rested its case.\nOn the second point, I agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. (Spencer v. Alaska Parkers[20]. As Kellock J.A. (as he then was) said in Rex v. Stephen et al.[21] : \"It is not sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury in bulk for valuation.\" The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be clearly presented to the jury's mind. Of course, it is not necessary that the trial judge should review all the facts, and that his charge be a minute record of the evidence adduced, but as Rivard, J.A. said in Vincent v. Regem[22] :\nIl faut admettre que l'adresse du juge est plut\u00f4t br\u00e8ve et que, tant sur les faits que sur les questions de droit, il n'a dit que l'essentiel, sans d\u00e9veloppement. Mais la question n'est pas de savoir si le juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 court; il faut rechercher plut\u00f4t s'il a omis le n\u00e9cessaire.\nIn Wu v. The King[23], Mr. Justice Lamont speaking for this Court expressed his views as follows:\u2011\nThere is no doubt that in the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and, in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or otherwise. What is essential is that the record contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid. Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.\nMore recently, Mr. Justice Kerwin in Forsythe v. The King[24], also said:\u2011\nHowever, while the general statement of the law of conspiracy made by the trial judge may be unimpeachable, it was of the utmost importance in this case that the application of the law to the facts should be explained fully to the jury, particularly so far as the evidence relating to Carson's activities was concerned.\nIn Rex v. Arnold[25], the Court of Appeal ,of Ontario ordered a new trial, and Mr. Justice Laidlaw, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court restated the law as follows:\u2011\nAn accused is entitled to have a trial judge give the theory of the defence to the jury, and it is difficult to conceive of a case where, in doing so, he can refrain from making at least some reference to the evidence. Here, I am thoroughly satisfied that there was misdirection to the jury on the subject of consent, and apart from that misdirection I think it was incumbent upon the learned trial judge to do more than simply say to the jury that it was for them to decide whom they believed, without making any reference to the evidence at all.\nIf any other authority is needed, see Brooks v. The King[26], Markadonis v. The King[27] , Rex v. Hill et al[28].\nIn the present case, the trial judge, after having ex\u00adplained the law to the jury, said:\u2011\nNow, as to facts. I will not comment on them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to say, not for me.\nHe then recapitulated in a few words what the Crown Attorney and Counsel for the defence had said in their addresses, and concluded by saying:\u2011\nBoth points of view have been well elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.\nI do not think that this is sufficient. This trial lasted one week, twenty-four witnesses were heard of which twelve for the defence. Three experts, two of which were called by the appellant, gave very elaborate explanations on medical matters, and their respective opinions on the result of the autopsy that was performed on the body of the deceased woman. It was, I think, the duty of the trial judge, in summing up this highly technical and con\u00adflicting evidence, to strip it of the non-essentials, and as O'Halloran, J.A. said in Rex v. Hughes[29] to present to the jury the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision, and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and the answer of the defence, or such answer as the evidence permitted. Unfortunately, this has not been done, and the explanations and grounds of defence have not adequately been put before the jury.\nI am of opinion that the jury was left in a state of confusion, and I cannot say that after the judge's address, they were in a position to fully appreciate the value and effect of the evidence. As I do not think that the verdict would have necessarily been the same if the proper instruc\u00adtions had been given, I believe that 1014 (2) has no application.\nI would direct a new trial. RAND J. (dissenting) :-The defence here was plain and uncomplicated: it was that at the moment the accused was about to examine the woman internally for fibromas, a spontaneous process of miscarriage started causing a severance of the placenta from the wall of the uterus and leading to a fatal hemorrhage. The issue was simply whether the rupture was natural or had been provoked artificially by the accused with the intent of bringing about an abortion.\nThe facts were largely undisputed: only those at the critical moments leading to the severance were in contro\u00adversy. Four items of internal evidence were considered by the Crown to point to an artificially induced dilatation of the cervix: an abrasion of the cervix; dilation of the cervical canal; the presence of muscular fibre on the detached placenta; and the existence of a burrow along the canal. What was said against this was that, in the presence of fibromas, these conditions could possibly arise in the natural course of dilatation. There were, in addition, surrounding circumstances, presented in large part by the accused, on which little doubt or question could arise.\nBehind that facade of conditions and actions was con\u00adcealed the intent or purpose: was it legitimate or criminal? With what \"theory\" can we dignify such a simple situation? The trial took a full week and there was much examination of the medical testimony: but in the end, that of the defence reduced itself to what I have mentioned. What could the repetition of the four items have added to the knowledge or appreciation of that issue by the jury? They had listened to a proliferation of questions about them almost at nauseam. They would, most probably, have received a further reference to them from the court with secret impatience; and I have no doubt that the absence of such a repetition had not and could not have had the slightest influence on their minds in reaching their verdict. In such an uncomplicated question, to speak of a \"theory\" or to require as, virtually, an absolute rule, the recounting of the few salient facts would be to add an artificiality of no value to the machinery of trial. The rule cannot be taken to be absolute in requiring such an exposition; it depends upon the circumstances of each case. Lazure J., who presided, has had a long and distinguished experience in criminal trials, and in the situation as I con\u00adceive it, I must decline to disregard his judgment that the narrow issues and significant facts, with all their implica\u00adtions, were fully and intelligently appreciated by the jury. No objection to the charge was made by the able counsel representing the accused nor was the ground urged here taken in the notice of appeal to the King's Bench.\nThe rule arises from the necessity that the jury be fully apprised of every aspect of the case; their judgment other-wise would be vitiated. But once that essential condition is satisfied, anything further of the nature suggested here would be a useless impediment. Its value is as a safeguard against misjudging the jury's grasp of the issues and in the impartial examination of controverted, involved or complex matters and their significance. But there are situations in which it can be said with judicial certainty that reiteration is unnecessary; in such cases the verdict is given in disregard of its presence or absence. I take the condition of the rule to be that the statement required must be such that its omission might have affected the verdict: if, as here, it could not have done so, there is no ground for appeal and a fortiori no substantial wrong has been done.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nEsTEY, J.:-The appellant, charged with the murder of Mrs. P., was found guilty of manslaughter. His conviction was affirmed in the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, in the Province of Quebec [30], Chief Justice Galipeault dissenting.\nMrs. P., on August 20, 1947, went to the office of the appellant, a medical practitioner in Montreal, where, be-cause of a haemorrhage caused by the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, she died.\nThe Crown contends that the haemorrhage resulted from an attempt on the appellant's part to effect an abortion. The appellant contends that the separation and consequent haemorrhage were due to natural causes. The Crown called evidence as to events and conversa\u00adtions leading to the examination, the manner in which Mrs. P. was prepared therefore and the circumstances at the office. A pathologist was also called who made a post mortem on the afternoon of the death. He found the cervical canal abnormally dilated in relation to the length of the cervix, abrasions on the cervix, a burrow or groove on the cervical canal and fibres on the placenta, which came from the uterine wall. These factors, viewed as a whole, together with his negative observations in his opinion justified the conclusion that there had been an attempted abortion.\nThe appellant admitted making an examination of the lungs, heart and abdomen and the taking of a haemoglobin test; that before he had made any internal examination she had commenced to haemorrhage; that in the course of his efforts to stop the haemorrhage he used a speculum, a tenaculum and did some packing. He also gave her Pituitrin and Vitamin K.\nThe medical evidence is all to the effect that Mrs. P. had been pregnant between five and six months. It is also clear that she had several fibroids upon the wall of her uterus which, because of their size and condition, had been there some time. The appellant was of the opinion that Mrs. P. was in labour when she consulted him on the 20th and that because of the fibroids and consequently diseased and weakened condition of the tissues this separation of the placenta occurred in the course of labour. Moreover, he stated that the fact that she was in labour explained the dilatation of the cervical canal.\nTwo pathologists were called on behalf of the appellant whose evidence lent support to the view that the dilatation of the cervical canal might have happened normally, par\u00adticularly if she was in labour. They also expressed the view that in the same circumstances, because of the diseased and weakened condition of the tissues of the uterine wall, the fibres might have separated therefrom with, and remained upon the placenta. As to the abrasions on the cervix and the groove on the cervical canal, these did pro-vide evidence of trauma or injury which might have been caused in the course of the packing. The learned trial judge clearly and appropriately discussed the relevant law, the certainty that must be estab\u00adlished where the evidence is circumstantial and that the jury must be satisfied that the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt before finding him guilty. In the course of his charge the learned judge stated, in part, as follows:\nNow, as to facts. I will not comment on them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to say, not for me.\nAgain he stated:\nBoth points of view have been well elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.\nThe authorities contemplate that in the course of his charge a trial judge should, as a general rule, explain the relevant law and so relate it to the evidence that the jury may appreciate the issues or questions they must pass upon in order to render a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Where, as here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is particularly important that he should do so in a manner that will assist the jury in determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will attribute to the respective portions. It is, of course, unnecessary that the jury's attention be directed to all of the evidence, and how far a trial judge should go in discussing it must depend in each case upon the nature and character of the evidence in relation to the charge, the issues raised and the conduct of the trial. Wu v. The King[31] ; Brooks v. The King [32] ; Picken v. The King [33] ; Preston v. The King [34]; Black-stone, Vol. 3, ch. 23, p. 375; The Queen v. Coney [35]; Rex. v. Bateman[36].\nMoreover, the defence throughout was that the accused had treated Mrs. P. in a professional and legal manner. This was supported by evidence of the accused as to his own conduct, his professional opinion as to the nature and character of the natural cause of the separation of the placenta and of his efforts to save her life. The evidence of the pathologists, called on his own behalf, somewhat supported his opinion as to the natural cause of the separation of the placenta and the dilatation of the cervical canal. They also expressed their opinions that the abrasions and groove might have been caused by instruments used in the course of packing.\nThis theory of the defence and the evidence in relation thereto were not placed before the jury in a manner that would assist the jurymen in appreciating the particular facts and circumstances they should consider in determin\u00ading whether the accused be guilty or not guilty. Brooks v. The King, supra; Rex v. Henderson [37]; Rex v. Kirk[38]); Rex v. Arnold[39].\nThere was ample evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, might have found the accused guilty, but it cannot be said that a jury, acting judicially, would neces\u00adsarily have arrived at that conclusion and, therefore, it is\nnot a case for the application of the provisions of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nFAUTEUX J. (dissenting) :-A careful consideration of the record convinced me that the practical significance which the defence expert opinions could have at the end of the case was more dependent upon than promoting the measure of credit the jury would then be ready to attach to the very testimony of the appellant himself. Exonerating possibilities indicated by them could only be of trivial or no value if his relation .of the occurrence, considered in the light of the rest of the evidence, was not accepted as truthful. That the jury did disbelieve what he said as to the nature of his intervention is clearly manifested by their verdict. I have reached the conclusion that had the trial Judge dealt with the expert opinions exhaustively, the case for the appellant would have been weakened rather than strengthened. As there will be a new trial, it is not convenient to review the evidence in order to demonstrate the factual premises upon which the above findings are made. One may point out, however, that these conclusions are not inconsistent with but, in some degree, supported by the fact that in the course of his address, the then counsel of the appellant-an able one, as the record shows-rather invited the jury to minimize the value to be attached to expert opinions, the fact that he did not, at the end of the address of the trial Judge, raise any objections as to the omission of the latter to review this or other evidence, the fact that, in the notice of appeal, counsel did not even mention this ground on which the argument before us was centered and which, moreover, is not the one upon which the appeal in the Court below fell virtually to be determined.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

V, c. 93, s. 40\u2014By-Law 326, ss. 84, 85\u2014Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, s. 426.\nBy section 84 of By-Law 326 of the City of Outremont, it was provided that only detached or semi-detached cottages shall be erected on certain streets in the City; and by section 85, the Council was given the discretion to \"allow the construction of churches, schools and hospitals in any place in the City\".\nDesiring to enlarge its school building, which had been erected in a prohibited area before the prohibition came into force, the respondent applied to the City for a permit to erect an extension of the school building on two adjoining lots, being also in the area covered by the by-law. The permit was refused by the Council.\nThereupon, the respondent instituted proceedings by way of mandamus against the City for a declaration that the by-law did not prohibit the construction contemplated and, if it did, that sections 84 and 85 be declared ultra vires and the permit granted.\nThe Superior Court held the sections to be valid but that they did not apply in this case. Without passing on the validity of the sections, the Court of Appeal for Quebec held also that they were not applicable in the present instance.\nHeld, that the appeal should be dismissed since sections 84 and 85 of By-Law 326 of the City of Outremont, even assuming that they were applicable to this case, were ultra vires the powers of the City as delegated to it by its Charter.\nFirstly, since in the matter of municipal legislation, the corporations have no other powers than those formally delegated by the Legislature, which powers the corporations cannot extend nor exceed; since the City was empowered by its charter to regulate by by-law the nature of the dwellings to be erected within its territory; and since by section 85, the City did not regulate by by-law the erection of the buildings mentioned therein\u2014but on the contrary left the decision ultimately to the discretion of the Council\u2014, the City has exceeded its legislation powers and section 85 is, therefore, ultra vires. Secondly, since it cannot be said that the City, but for the provisions of Section 85, would have enacted the prohibition in section 84 in such an absolute form, as it is obvious that the City wanted the cases in section 85 treated differently, section 84 must also be considered as ultra vires.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and granting the writ of mandamus.\nJean Martineau, Q.C. and Louis Philippe Gagnon, Q.C., for the appellant. It is unfounded in law to say that the Public Education Act has priority over the Cities and Towns Act, because however important may be the education of the children, the welfare and health of the community as a whole is even more important. Anyway, both parties have repudiated that conclusion of the trial judge. The respondents have the right to choose the site of their school or to enlarge same, but the choice must be made without violating the by-laws of the municipality. City of Toronto Corp. v. Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools of Toronto 2.\nThe argument of one of the judges of the Court of Appeal that an enlargement of a building is not itself a building and that therefore the building that the respondents wanted to erect is not subject to section 84, is not founded in law. As a matter of fact, an addition to a building must necessarily be a building itself. Wilmot et al v. The City of Kingston 3. The next argument is that the respondents having built their schools before the prohibition, they had a vested right to enlarge it. It is true that the by-law speaks of buildings to be erected. But the purpose of the by-law was not intended to prevent the use of buildings already erected or to force their demolition, but it was to prevent the erection of any further buildings. Therefore, to say that this by-law did not apply to vacant land already owned at the time of its adoption, is to say that the by-law has absolutely no effect. It would prevent cities from enacting zoning and building by-laws. Presswood v. City of Toronto 4. The Court is asked here by the respondents to go much further than in Scott v. Toronto 5. The Legislature made no exception for schools when it gave the appellant the power to enact the by-law. The power to expropriate, which is only a corollary of the right to buy, cannot give the respondents the power to disiegard the by-laws.\nAld\u00e9ric Laurendeau, Q.C. and Kenneth A. Wilson, Q.C., for the respondents. The prohibitions and restrictions contained in by-law 326 of the City do not apply in the present instance. The trustees when it comes to choosing a site for a school are absolute masters. It is their duty to build schools when required. They may be forced to do so by a ratepayer. They have had that faculty and duty since 1866 in virtue of 29.30 Vict., c. 31. And the by-law could have no effect as against the Education Act. It cannot be shown that the Legislature wanted and intended to derogate from the Education Act.\nThe respondents have acquired rights. With the existence of a school there exists the right to expand its usefulness.\nThe trustees act under the direction of the superintendent of education. If the corporation has the right to prohibit the erection of a school on one street, it has the right to do so on all streets. In other words, to prohibit all schools within its boundaries. The same for Churches. Yet the Education Act obliges the trustees to erect at least one school in each school district.\nThe only recourse against a decision of the trustees under s. 236 of the Education Act is by appeal to the Circuit Court or the Magistrate's Court and the judgment is final provided the school commission does not exceed its powers. Commissaires d'\u00e9coles de St-F\u00e9licien v. H\u00e9bert 6, which judgment was confirmed by the Supreme Court 7. Only a ratepayer may take such an appeal and a municipal corporation is not a ratepayer. The same principle was applied to churches where the Bishop decides finally on the site of a church. Dorval v. \u0152uvre et Fabrique de Saint-Louis de France 8. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux, J.\u2014Ce litige est n\u00e9 des faits suivants. Depuis plus de quarante ans, la corporation intim\u00e9e maintient et dirige, en la cit\u00e9 d'Outremont, une \u00e9cole sise \u00e0 l'angle du Chemin de la C\u00f4te Ste-Catherine et de l'avenue Pagnuelo. Pr\u00e9voyant qu'un agrandissement du local serait rendu n\u00e9cessaire par l'augmentation de la population \u00e0 desservir, l'intim\u00e9e achetait, en 1937, deux lots contigus ayant front sur l'avenue Pagnuelo et adjacents au terrain o\u00f9 cette \u00e9cole \u00e9tait \u00e9rig\u00e9e.\nNotons incidemment qu'au temps de cet achat et depuis 1925, ces deux lots \u00e9taient, par r\u00e8glement de la cit\u00e9 appelante, frapp\u00e9s d'une prohibition d'y construire d'autres b\u00e2tisses que des \"cottages isol\u00e9s\". Ce r\u00e8glement, portant le num\u00e9ro 180, fut abrog\u00e9 en 1938 pour \u00eatre, au m\u00eame temps, remplac\u00e9 par un autre, portant le num\u00e9ro 326, depuis lors en vigueur. L'article 84 de ce dernier r\u00e8glement maintient la prohibition indiqu\u00e9e et l'article 85 donne au conseil de la cit\u00e9 un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de permettre ou refuser, en tout endroit de la cit\u00e9, la construction d'\u00e9glises, d'\u00e9coles et d'h\u00f4pitaux.\nCe que l'intim\u00e9e avait pr\u00e9vu en 1937 s'av\u00e9ra \u00e9ventuellement une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 in\u00e9luctable et, en 1940, on dut d\u00e9cider de l'\u00e9rection de constructions nouvelles sur l'unique emplacement disponible, soit sur les lots ci-dessus. Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du R\u00e8glement 326, des plans furent pr\u00e9par\u00e9s et soumis \u00e0 l'approbation du mis-en-cause, inspecteur nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 ces fins, suivant le r\u00e8glement. \u00c9ventuellement, l'affaire fut port\u00e9e devant le conseil de la cit\u00e9 et, finalement, l'approbation des plans et l'\u00e9mission du permis furent refus\u00e9s, uniquement \u00e0 raison de la prohibition \u00e9tablie en l'article 84 et du d\u00e9faut de l'intim\u00e9e d'obtenir du conseil la permission que ce dernier pouvait lui donner en vertu de l'article 85. D'o\u00f9 l'action de l'intim\u00e9e contre l'appelante et le mis-en-cause.\nDans sa requ\u00eate pour bref de mandamus, l'intim\u00e9e conclut, entre autres, \u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le R\u00e8glement 326 ne prohibe pas la construction qu'elle d\u00e9sire \u00e9riger sur les lots pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s et que si ce r\u00e8glement, et sp\u00e9cialement les dispositions des articles 84 et 85, devaient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme prohibant cette construction, ces dispositions soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es ill\u00e9gales, ultra vires et, en l'esp\u00e8ce, sans effet \u00e0 son endroit. On demande, en cons\u00e9quence, l'\u00e9mission d'un bref peremptoire de mandamus ordonnant \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 et au mis-en-cause d'\u00e9mettre le permis recherch\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9cida de la validit\u00e9 des articles 84 et 85 du r\u00e8glement mais, se basant sur ces dispositions de la Loi de l'Instruction Publique (1941 R.S.Q., c. 59), faisant un devoir aux syndics des \u00e9coles dans chaque municipalit\u00e9 de choisir et acqu\u00e9rir, m\u00eame par expropriation, les terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour les emplacements de leurs \u00e9coles, d\u00e9clara que cette loi primait sur la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes et les R\u00e8glements de la cit\u00e9 et en conclut que le R\u00e8glement 326 n'avait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune application. Avec cette interpr\u00e9tation, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait libre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 construire sans permis pr\u00e9alable et son action fut renvoy\u00e9e, mais sans frais.\nLes deux parties appel\u00e8rent de cette d\u00e9cision. L'appel de la cit\u00e9 fut renvoy\u00e9 et celui des syndics maintenu. La Cour du Banc de la Reine (si\u00e9geant en appel 9) ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la validit\u00e9 des articles 84 et 85 du R\u00e8glement 326. \u00c9tant unanimes sur la conclusion\u2014sans l'\u00eatre sur les raisons\u2014que ces articles n'avaient, en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune application, les membres de cette Cour ont, par jugement formel, fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des syndics, ordonn\u00e9 l'\u00e9mission d'un bref peremptoire enjoignant \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 d'Ou-tremont et au mis-en-cause d'accorder, dans un d\u00e9lai imparti, le permis demand\u00e9 ; le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre la cit\u00e9. C'est la d\u00e9cision dont la cit\u00e9 demande maintenant la revision.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis arriv\u00e9 sur la question de la validit\u00e9 des articles 84 et 85 du R\u00e8glement 326, il devient inutile, aux fins du pr\u00e9sent jugement, de reproduire et consid\u00e9rer ici les diff\u00e9rentes raisons amenant les membres de la Cour d'Appel \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la non application de ces articles. Il est bien \u00e9vident, en effet, qu'une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de la leur sur le point ne pourrait \u00e9puiser le d\u00e9bat; d'autant plus que l'application elle-m\u00eame d'un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9pend n\u00e9cessairement et pri-mordialement de sa validit\u00e9; question qu'il convient maintenant d'examiner. En mati\u00e8re de l\u00e9gislation, les corporationt municipales n'ont de pouvoirs que ceux qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la L\u00e9gislature; et ces pouvoirs, elles ne peuvent ni les \u00e9tendre, ni les exc\u00e9der. (Phaneuf v. La Corporation du Village de St-Hughes 10).\nLes diverses lois de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, constituant la charte de ce qui s'appelait alors la ville d'Outremont, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9es et refondues en 1915 par une loi intitul\u00e9e Charte de la cit\u00e9 d'Outremont (5 Geo. V, c. 93), aux termes de laquelle la cit\u00e9 devient r\u00e9gie par les dispositions de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, sauf en ce qu'elles peuvent avoir d'incompatible avec les dispositions de cette charte. Suivant l'article 40 de cette loi de 1915, ainsi que le mentionne le savant Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel en ses notes: Le Conseil peut faire, amender et abroger des r\u00e8glements pour:\n1\u00b0 \u2026 Prescrire dans certaines rues l'architecture, la sym\u00e9trie ou le genre de maisons \u00e0 \u00e9riger, b\u00e2tisses isol\u00e9es, semi-isol\u00e9es, en pierre ou en brique solide ou lambriss\u00e9es ou autres; \u2026fixer l'endroit que devront occuper, et d\u00e9terminer la mani\u00e8re de construire des \u00e9chelles de sauvetage, tuyaux d'\u00e9gouts, goutti\u00e8res, et r\u00e9glementer en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral toute construction, reconstruction, r\u00e9paration et modification de tout b\u00e2timent, et tout ce qui s'y rattache; et emp\u00eacher la construction, suspendre l'\u00e9rection, et pourvoir sommairement \u00e0 l'abandon, l'isolation, la suppression, la d\u00e9molition, le d\u00e9placement, la r\u00e9paration ou la modificaiton, aux frais du propri\u00e9taire, de toutes b\u00e2tisses ou portions d'icelles en contravention avec les r\u00e8glements de la Cit\u00e9.\nC'est sous l'autorit\u00e9 de telles dispositions que le conseil de la cit\u00e9 entend justifier son droit d'adopter le texte suivant des articles 84 et 85,\u2014contenu au chapitre 4, intitul\u00e9 \"Zonage\"\u2014, du R\u00e8glement 326.\nArt. 84 (a) On ne pourra construire sur les rues ou avenues ou sur les parties de rues ou d'avenues ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es, que des cottages isol\u00e9s ........................... savoir ...................... avenue Pagnuelo.\n(b) ................................\n(c) ................................\n(d) On ne pourra construire sur les rues ou avenues ou sur les parties de rues ou d'avenues ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es, que des cottages isol\u00e9s ou \u00e0 demi isol\u00e9s ................ savoir ................ avenue Pagnuelo.\nArt. 85. Nonobstant toutes dispositions au contraire, le conseil pourra, par un vote des deux-tiers, permettre la construction d'\u00e9glises, d'\u00e9coles et d'h\u00f4pitaux en tout endroit de la cit\u00e9. Ainsi appara\u00eet-il que si, sur certaines rues de la cit\u00e9, dont l'avenue Pagnuelo, on a voulu et \u00e9dict\u00e9, par les prohibitions apparaissant en l'article 84, la limitation des constructions \u00e0 un type particulier, on a manifestement voulu et \u00e9dict\u00e9, par les dispositions de l'article 85, qu'en tout endroit de la cit\u00e9,\u2014couvert ou non par les dispositions de l'article 84 ou autres, peu importe,\u2014l'\u00e9tablissement d'\u00e9glises, d'\u00e9coles et d'h\u00f4pitaux soit laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du conseil auquel les dispositions de cet article donnent, en derni\u00e8re analyse et en chaque instance, le droit le plus absolu de permettre ou de refuser la construction. Il appara\u00eet, de plus, de ces dispositions de l'article, que ce droit peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par simple r\u00e9solution.\nJe ne crois pas qu'on puisse mettre en doute le pouvoir de la cit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer, d'\u00e9tablir par r\u00e8glements les prohibitions apparaissant \u00e0 l'article 84, non plus que son pouvoir\u2014\u00e9cartant, de cette consid\u00e9ration, les arguments tir\u00e9s de la Loi de l'Instruction Publique ou autres propres \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce,\u2014de faire ces prohibitions absolues au lieu de pourvoir \u00e0 une exception pour les cas des \u00e9glises, \u00e9coles et h\u00f4pitaux, ainsi qu'on l'a fait par les dispositions de l'article 85. Mais cette exception \u00e9tant \u00e9dict\u00e9e, et le cas de ces \u00e9tablissements particuliers \u00e9tant sp\u00e9cifiquement r\u00e9gi par les dispositions de cet article, il faut en tenir compte. Ce qu'on attaque et ce qui, en effet, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, c'est la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement tel qu'adopt\u00e9, et non tel qu'on pouvait l'adopter.\nEt ainsi deux questions se posent: 1o La cit\u00e9 peut-elle pr\u00e9tendre avoir, par les dispositions de cet article 85, l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9, r\u00e9glement\u00e9 sur la construction d'\u00e9glises, d'\u00e9coles et d'h\u00f4pitaux en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant et assujettissant, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de son conseil, chaque cas de construction de ces \u00e9tablissements particuliers, pour en disposer par r\u00e9solution plut\u00f4t que par r\u00e8glement? En somme, les dispositions de cet article sont-elles autoris\u00e9es par la L\u00e9gislature ou ultra vires des pouvoirs donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la cit\u00e9? 2\u00b0 Si, pour aucune raison, les dispositions de l'article 85 doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es ultra vires et, en cons\u00e9quence, retranch\u00e9es du r\u00e8glement, peut-on raisonnablement conclure que le conseil aurait adopt\u00e9 le texte actuel des dispositions de l'article 84 sans y adjoindre celles de l'article 85? La premi\u00e8re question. Sur le principe de l'existence et des limites du pouvoir des corporations municipales en mati\u00e8re de l\u00e9gislation, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e, plus haut, la cause de Phaneuf v. La Corporation du village de St-Hughes. Le texte pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant imm\u00e9diatement cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est pris au jugement m\u00eame de Sir Mathias Tellier, alors Juge en chef de la province. En plus de cette cause, on peut signaler les d\u00e9cisions suivantes, \u00e0 titre d'illustration de l'application de ce principe:\nLa Corporation du village de Ste-Agathe des Monts v. Reid 11. Dans cette cause, la Cour de Revision d\u00e9clarait ultra vires un r\u00e8glement prohibant l'\u00e9rection de certains moulins, \u00e0 moins d'avoir pr\u00e9alablement conf\u00e9r\u00e9 avec 3e conseil, en avoir obtenu la permission; le conseil devant d\u00e9terminer l'endroit de l'\u00e9tablissement de ces moulins. Rendant le jugement de la Cour, Sir Melbourne Tait, alors Juge en chef adjoint, d\u00e9clarait:\nIt is not really a by-law at all, but a declaration that the council may permit the erections referred to in art. 648 upon such conditions as it may think proper to make at any particular meeting. The rights of those who may desire to erect such manufactories or machinery are left uncertain, and it appears to me this so-called by-law is drawn contrary to the elementary principles upon which an ordinance of that kind ought to be made.\nDans Baikie v. City of Montreal and another 12, M. le Juge Chase Casgrain, se basant sur l'autorit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel dans Phaneuf v. Corporation du village de St-Hughes, affirmait \u00e0 la page 78 :\nA by-law which would discriminate, or allow the municipality or its governing body to discriminate between citizens, would be ultra vires and illegal.\nDans The Town of St. Louis v. Citizens Light and Power Co. 13, la Cour d'Appel, \u00e0 la page 41, d\u00e9clare:\nL'expression, \"peut faire des r\u00e8glements pour l'\u00e9clairage\", qui se trouve dans l'article 616, laisse au conseil la discr\u00e9tion d'exercer ou de ne pas exercer le pouvoir que la loi lui donne, mais cette discr\u00e9tion ne s'applique pas au mode \u00e0 suivre dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir. Aucun texte n'autorise le conseil \u00e0 proc\u00e9der par r\u00e9solution.\nDans la cause de City of Verdun v. Sun Oil Co. Ltd. 14, la Cour d'Appel d\u00e9clarait ultra vires cette partie d'un r\u00e8glement de la municipalit\u00e9 relative \u00e0 l'\u00e9rection de stations d'essence, accordant au conseil de la cit\u00e9 un pouvoir d'accorder ou de refuser, \u00e0 discr\u00e9tion, la permission d'\u00e9tablir tels \u00e9tablissements. Cette d\u00e9cision fut confirm\u00e9e par un jugement unanime de cette Cour 15. A la page 229, on lit ce qui suit relativement au r\u00e8glement en litige:\nThe mere reading of section 76 is sufficient to conclude that in enacting it, the City did nothing in effect but to leave ultimately to the exclusive discretion of the members of the Council of the City, for the time being in office, what it was authorized by the provincial Legislature, under section 426, to actually regulate by by-law. Thus, section 76 effectively transforms an authority to regulate by legislation into a mere administrative and discretionary power to cancel by resolution a right which, untrammelled in the absence of any by-law, could only, in a proper one, be regulated.\nA mon humble avis, en \u00e9dietant les dispositions de l'article 85, le conseil de la cit\u00e9 a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 les pouvoirs de l\u00e9gislation que lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9s la L\u00e9gislature. On n'a pas r\u00e9glement\u00e9 sur ces cas qu'on a soustraits \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de l'article 84. On s'est attribu\u00e9 le droit d'en disposer, chacun individuellement, suivant la discr\u00e9tion, l'arbitraire des membres du conseil pouvant alors \u00eatre en office. On n'a, de fait, d\u00e9fini aucun principe pouvant gouverner l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion. On a, enfin, exc\u00e9d\u00e9 les limites de l'autorit\u00e9 re\u00e7ue de la L\u00e9gislature en s'arrogeant de d\u00e9cider par r\u00e9solution ce qu'on devait r\u00e9gir par r\u00e8glement. Ce n'est pas ce que l'article 40 de la Charte de la cit\u00e9, ou ce que l'article correspondant de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes (R.S.Q. 1941, ch. 233, art. 426) autorisent; et je doute qu'aucune loi de la L\u00e9gislature permette\u2014en pareille mati\u00e8re\u2014aux membres d'un conseil municipal de paralyser avec une telle discr\u00e9tion et aussi fondamentalement l'exercice du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Les dispositions de cet article 85 sont donc ultra vires.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me question. En principe, un r\u00e8glement, nul en partie, l'est totalement. La Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, comme le Code municipal, d'ailleurs, pr\u00e9voient qu'un r\u00e8glement municipal peut \u00eatre cass\u00e9, \"en tout ou en partie\". Comme le fait remarquer M. le Juge Rivard dans Compagnie \u00c9lectrique du Saguenay, Lt\u00e9e, v. Corporation du Village de St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, et St. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Power Ltd. 16, il faut donner \u00e0 ces expressions une port\u00e9e conforme \u00e0 la doctrine expos\u00e9e par les commentateurs du droit public en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e8glement municipal. Le savant Juge r\u00e9f\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'extrait suivant de McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations, 2e \u00e9dition, vol. 2, n\u00b0 862 :\nIt is essential that the parts upheld form, independently of the invalid portion, a complete law in some reasonable aspect, so that it may be fairly concluded that the Council would have enacted it without the invalid part \u2026 The test is : Has the legislative body manifested an intention to deal with a part of the subject-matter covered, irrespective of the rest of the subject-matter? If such intention is manifest, the subject-matter is separable, otherwise not.\nIl me semble \u00e9vident que sans la pr\u00e9sence des dispositions de l'article 85, la cit\u00e9 n'aurait pas donn\u00e9 une forme aussi absolue aux prohibitions \u00e9dict\u00e9es en l'article 84 puisque, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, on a manifestement voulu, par les premiers mots de l'article 85, traiter s\u00e9par\u00e9ment du cas des \u00e9glises, \u00e9coles et h\u00f4pitaux et soustraire ces cas \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de toutes autres dispositions, y compris celles de l'article 84. De toutes fa\u00e7ons, il suffit de ne pouvoir affirmer que, sans les dispositions de l'article 85, les dispositions de l'article 84 eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 couch\u00e9es en cette forme absolue. L'article 84 doit subir le sort de l'article 85 et, comme lui, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ultra vires. Et pour cette raison, assumant m\u00eame que les articles 84 et 85 s'appliqueraient \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce, la cit\u00e9 ne peut les opposer, comme elle l'a fait, \u00e0 la demande de la corporation intim\u00e9e.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Sauv\u00e9, Gagnon & L'Heureux.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Wilson & Home.\nReporter's note: On December 17, 1952, the City of Outremont moved for a re-hearing before this Court and on December 22, 1952, the following judgment was rendered by the Court:\n\"Sur la requ\u00eate de la Cit\u00e9 d'Outremont demandant de suspendre l'effet du jugement rendu par cette Cour le 29 octobre 1952 et d'accorder une r\u00e9-audition de l'appel de la Cit\u00e9:\u2014Assumant qu'il soit loisible \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de demander la r\u00e9-audition, la Cour est d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'accorder cette requ\u00eate ; le point soumis ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 aux fins du jugement d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu et les arguments apport\u00e9s par la Cit\u00e9, au cours de l'audition de la requ\u00eate, ne pouvant affecter la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle la Cour en est arriv\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite de l'appel.

The Militia Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 132, as amended by 1947 (Can.) c. 21, ss. 14, 20, 69(2), 115, 117 and 138.\nIn an action for damages arising out of the collision between a taxicab and an army truck owned by the Crown and driven by a soldier of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (Reserve), who on the order of his commanding officer was using the truck to convey a civilian baseball team, Cameron J., in the Exchequer Court, held that the accident was solely due to the negligence of the soldier; that the truck was used contrary to army regulations and that the commanding officer had no authority to use it for such purposes. He found further that the soldier was on duty and that it was within the scope of his duties to drive military vehicles when directed to do so by his commanding officer and not open to him to question such an order; and that as the soldier at the time of the accident was a servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment, the principle of respondeat superior applied and the Crown was therefore liable for the damages sustained.\nOn appeal to this Court the finding of negligence was not questioned but the Crown contended that under the relevant legislation, army regulations and orders, the commanding officer had no authority to make use of the truck for the purposes described, and that while the soldier was under a duty to obey the lawful orders of his superior officer, the order in question was an unlawful one and that consequently in driving the truck pursuant thereto he was not acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nHeld: (Rand and Locke JJ. dissenting), that in the circumstances of the case, the soldier was acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nPer: Kellock J. Under the circumstances of the case, there was nothing to indicate that the order was an unlawful order. It was therefore the duty of the soldier to obey. Keighly v. Bell 4 F & F 763 at 790, applied.\nPer: Estey J. The commanding officer was authorized to promote recruiting. It was part of his duty to direct the use of Army vehicles for military purposes, including that of recruiting. In issuing the transport work ticket authorizing the use of the vehicle here in question he misconstrued the regulations, but this issue was so closely associated with that authority which it was his duty to exercise that it cannot be said that in doing so he acted without the scope of his employment. Neither could it be said of the sergeant to whom the transport work ticket was issued, nor of the driver, who received the instructions from him. Dyer v. Munday [1895] 1 Q.B.D. 742 at 746; Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. [1912] A.C. 716 at 737; Percy v. Corporation of the City of Glasgow [1922] A.C. 299 at 306; Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo [1925] A.C. 550 and Lockart v. C.P.R. [1942] A.C. 591, applied.\nPer: Cartwright J. In the circumstances of the case it was the soldier's duty to obey the order and in doing so he was acting within the scope of his duty. Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-Cab Co. Ltd. [1912] 3 K.B. 588. He did not know his commanding officer had no right to give him the order nor could it be said on the evidence that as a reasonable man he should have known. Evans v. Bartlam [1937] A.C. 473 at 479; Hodgkinson v. Fernie (1859) 11 C.B.N.S. 415 at 421.\nPer: Rand J. (dissenting): It was not within the scope of the authority of the commanding officer, directly or indirectly, to give a lawful order which could make the driving of the truck an act of the soldier within the course of his duties. A campaign for recruits was authorized and the means was assumed to be in the commanding officer but its scope could not extend to the violation of express regulations dealing with the use of equipment by which he was bound. The trip was an act of an extra-service nature and there was nothing before the Court to warrant the conclusion that, since the trip would involve the expense of conveyance, a bus could be hired on behalf of the Government, nor that in the face of the regulations cited, the truck could be used for such a purpose. Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-Cab Co. Ltd., supra, on which the Court below relied, distinguished. There the servant was bound to obey, here the only order the soldier was bound to obey was a lawful order. The special character of military relations might justify his obedience but that did not make the act done that of the Crown. If the commanding officer himself had driven the truck, he would not have bound the Crown, nor could he engage the Crown's responsibility by ordering a subordinate to do the same act.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting): The use of the Army truck to carry the baseball team was contrary to the Army Regulations and the commanding officer had no authority to authorize its use for such purpose. The general instructions given him to recruit could not be construed as authorizing the carrying on of such activities by means forbidden by Army Orders. The obligation of the soldier who drove the truck under The Militia Act and the King's Regulations and Orders was to obey lawful orders only. In acting in accordance with an order not lawfully given, he was not acting within the scope of his duties or employment within the meaning of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act (Bourton v. Beauchamp, [1920] A.C. 1001; Moore v. Donnelly, [1921], 1 A.C. 329 applied). The scope of the duties and employment of the soldier could not be extended by his mistaken understanding as to what they were (Wardley v. Enthoven (1917) 86 L.J.K.B. 309). APPEAL by the Crown from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J. 1, allowing the suppliants' Petition of Right to recover damages because of the negligence of an officer or servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and K. E. Eaton for the appellant. The trial judge erred in holding that the driver, Ryan, was acting within the scope of his duties or employment as a servant of the Crown at the time of accident. Ryan was not engaged on any business of the Crown in the right of Canada. The transportation of a baseball team was wholly unconnected with the business activities of the Government of Canada. Poulton v. London & Southwestern Ry. Co. 2; Halparin v. Bulling 3; Battistoni v. Thomas 4; Dallas v. Hinton 5. The Crown is not liable for what is done in the course of an undertaking which is not part of the Crown's business merely because some of the participants are servants of the Crown for other purposes and because there may be an indirect benefit from the undertaking. Offerdahl v. Okanagan Centre Irrigation & Power Co. 6. If Ryan received an \"order\" to go on a trip, it could not have been obeyed by him as a military order, since under the Militia Act, s. 69(2) as enacted by 1947 (Can.) c. 21, s. 22, he was not subject to laws, regulations and orders relating to the Canadian Army at the time it was communicated to him because: (i) he was not then on active service, (ii) it was not issued during a period of annual training or drill under the Act, (iii) it was not issued while he was on military duty, in the uniform of his unit or within any place used for the purposes of the Canadian Army, and (iv) it was not issued to him during any drill or parade of his unit at which he was present in the ranks or as a spectator nor was it issued to him when he was going to or from the place of the parade. When obeying an \"order\" not given within the limits laid down by this provision, Ryan was not acting within the scope of his duties or employment as a member of the Canadian Army. The order he received could not operate to extend such scope beyond the statutory limits established by s. 69(2). Cases such as Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-Cab Co. 7; Smith v. Martin 8; Risdale v. S.S. Kilmarnock 9, apply only where the orders are such, as by terms of the servant's employment, he was bound to obey. They do not apply to an order requiring an inferior servant to do something outside the scope of his employment whether or not the inferior servant was aware of the limits imposed by the employer on the employment. Gaskell v. St. Helen's Colliery Co. 10.\nThe baseball club's trip was arranged by Reid probably as Director of the Prince Edward Island Department of Physical Fitness and certainly was not arranged by or on behalf of the Crown in the right of Canada or the Canadian Army. He could not as commanding officer of the Regiment have directed the Knights of Columbus ball team to take the trip nor have instructed their manager as such regarding the trip. His ex post facto justification of the use of the military vehicle on the ground that the trip was a recruiting activity is not borne out by the facts.\nThe trial judge erred in holding that Ryan was operating the military vehicle pursuant to an order given him as a member of the armed forces. Reid said the work ticket was issued to \"enable\" Ryan to proceed with a ball team to Souris and return and that he gave Ryan no other orders. Sergeant Charles Ryan said that Reid told him there was a trip for a baseball team and that he told the driver Harrison Ryan, where he was to pick it up and his destination. On the face of it, none of these arrangements had anything to do with the Canadian Army and none of the men who went on the trip gave evidence that at the time they thought that they did. Sergeant Ryan knew nothing of a recruiting campaign. In any event it was outside Driver Ryan's duties or employment to operate a military vehicle on a trip prohibited by regulations respecting the operation of such vehicles. It did not fall within the permitted use of vehicles to transport service personnel to sports fields because the persons being transported were not \"service personnel\" and because the trip was to a place more than twenty miles distant and no special authority had been obtained therefor. It was not permitted by the Regulation providing for transportation of \"prospective army recruits\" because the persons transported were not being transported as \"prospective army recruits\" and their transportation had not been authorized in the prescribed manner. The trip was not authorized by the special provision concerning the transportation of the Royal Canadian Cadet Corps because the persons being transported were not being transported as cadets and were not being transported in connection with a \"duly authorized parade or training activity.\" The Regulations made by the Quarter Master General pursuant to s. 11 and Appendix VI of the King's Regulations and Orders, made by the Governor in Council under s. 139 of the Militia Act, limit the scope of employment of members of the armed forces operating military transport. Whelan v. Moore 11; Knowles v. Southern Ry. Co. 12; Bourton v. Beauchamp 13; Moore v. Donnelly 14. The regulations restricted the scope of Ryan's employment and it is immaterial whether he was aware of them. Wardle v. Enthoven & Sons Ltd. 15; Cartwright v. Shell-Mex & B.P. Ltd. 16. The front cover of \"Regulations for Military Operated Vehicles, 1947\" require that \"this pamphlet must be carried at all times by every qualified driver of a military operated vehicle irrespective of rank \u2026\" The prohibitions made the trip something outside of Ryan's employment and not merely an unauthorized way of doing some work he was appointed to do. Compare Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo 17 and Lockart v. C.P.R. 18.\nEven if Ryan can be regarded as having acted pursuant to a military order he was not at the time of the accident acting within the scope of his duties or employment as a servant of the Crown because his services were loaned or transferred, for the purpose of the trip, either to the Knights of Columbus ball team, the Provincial Department of Physical Fitness, Reid, or some other person or authority other than the Crown in the right of Canada. Salmond on Torts 10 Ed. 86-7; Donovan v. Laing 19; Bull & Co. v. West African Shipping Agency 20; Century Insurance Co. v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board 21.\nD. L. Mathieson Q.C. and G. R. Foster for the respondents. The only point in issue is whether the trial judge was correct in finding that at the time of the accident Corporal Ryan, the admitted servant of the appellant was acting within the scope of his duties or employment within the meaning of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended, s. 19(c), as alleged by the respondents in the Petitions of Right. The respondents submit that the trial judge was correct in confining his inquiry to the ascertainment of the scope of Corporal Ryan's duties or employment in order to determine the jurisdiction of the Court and in holding that \"while Reid committed a breach of the regulations regarding the use of military vehicles .... such breach did not narrow the scope of Ryan's duties or employment\". His decision was based on the common sense principle that a soldier in Ryan's position must give implicit obedience to the orders given him by his commanding officer in the ordinary matters of the service, except where such orders are clearly contrary to law. The evidence clearly establishes that Brigadier Reid as Corporal Ryan's commanding officer gave the order to make the trip in the normal manner, that is by issuing a transport work ticket and by passing this order to Corporal Ryan through the sergeant in charge of transport. No evidence was submitted to show that on receipt of this order Corporal Ryan knew it was contrary to regulations, or, in fact, that Corporal Ryan had any knowledge of the regulations. Reid as commanding officer was obviously designated by the appellant as one authorized to give orders on its behalf. In exercising that authority he ordered Ryan to make the trip as a military driver, an order which by its nature Ryan would have the right to assume as coming under the authority of his commanding officer. It was therefore his duty as a soldier to obey. The trial judge was correct in applying to the facts of this case, Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-Cab Co. Ltd. 22; Charlesworth on Negligence at p. 50. If the jurisdiction of the Court depends not only on the scope of Corporal Ryan's duties or employment but also on Brigadier Reid's, then the respondents submit that the appellant is still liable, despite the breach of the regulations by Brigadier Reid, because he was engaged in a matter incidental to and arising out of the business of the appellant. It is not disputed that the latter did an act which his master, the appellant, had not authorized, in permitting the army truck to make the journey without first obtaining the proper consent under the regulations. However the act was so connected with his duty to encourage recruitment, an act which the appellant authorized, that it may rightly be regarded as a mode\u2014although an improper mode\u2014of doing that act, and the appellant remains liable. Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo 23; Limpus v. The General Omnibus Co. 24; Salmond on Torts 10 Ed., 90; Bayley v. Manchester 25.\nIt was urged on behalf of the appellant that Corporal Ryan could not be said to be the servant or agent of the appellant acting within the scope of his duties or employment because he was at all relevant times the servant or agent of the Knights of Columbus working for them and under their control. The burden of proof rests on the appellant, and this burden is a heavy one. Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd. 26. Not only is the burden a heavy one but the presumption is all against there being such a transfer. Century Insurance Co. v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board 27; Nicholas v. F. J. Sparks & Son 28; Chowdhary v. Gillot 29. Not only have the appellants failed to discharge the burden of proof and overcome the presumption but on the contrary the evidence clearly establishes that the appellant retained control over its admitted servant, Corporal Ryan. See also Jones v. Scullard 30.\nIn the Mersey Docks case, supra, Lord Porter at p. 17 points out that where both a mechanical device, in this case the army truck, and its driver are both loaned the inference is that the servant remains the servant of the general employer. See also Jones v. Scullard, supra. If therefore the vehicle and Corporal Ryan were loaned to the Knights of Columbus the presumption is against Corporal Ryan being transferred because in the words of Lord Wright in the Century Insurance case, supra, at p. 497, \"he was bound to have regard to paramount directions given by the respondents (the permanent employers) and was to safeguard their paramount interests.\"\nIt was established that Corporal Ryan was paid by the appellant for the performance of his duties as a military driver on the day in question, and it was found as a fact by the trial judge that he was \"undoubtedly on duty that day\", therefore there can be no dispute that the appellant was the only person with power to dismiss him, and therefore retained control of his servant. No evidence was adduced to show that Ryan, either expressly or impliedly, consented to being transferred to the Knights of Columbus, and the absence of such consent implies that he remained the servant of the appellant. Mersey Docks case, supra, per Lord MacMillan at p. 14. Nor was it shown Ryan was working with the Knights in response to any request from them or under any agreement between them and the appellant. Clelland v. Edward Lloyd Ltd. 31. The evidence as a whole, and the findings of fact by the trial judge, point conclusively to the fact that only \"the use and benefit\" of Corporal Ryan's work could be considered as transferred but that Corporal Ryan at all times remained the servant of the appellant.\nRand J. (dissenting) :\u2014I am unable to agree that it was within the scope of the authority of Col. Reid, directly or indirectly, to give a lawful order which could make the driving of the lorry an act of the corporal within the course of his duties as a member of the 17th Reconnaissance Regiment, Reserve, Armoured Corps.\nThe original arrangement had been that a baseball team from Charlottetown, which the regiment sponsored, should go to Souris, but for some reason this could not be carried out; and Col. Reid, in order not to disappoint the community of Souris, which he thought might do harm to recruitment there, arranged to send another sponsored by the Knights of Columbus. Both of these teams played in a local baseball league, and the players included members of the cadet corps of one of the city schools, affiliated with the regiment.\nUndoubtedly a campaign for recruits to the regiment was authorized and encouraged, and an area of discretion in means was assumed to be in the Officer Commanding; but its scope could not extend to the violation of express regulations by which he was bound. There were such regulations that dealt with the use of equipment, and they took their character from the underlying separateness of army action from civilian action, a separateness amounting to the creation, in some respects and to some degree, of a relation analogous to a military imperium. Basically, army action of any sort is confined to army personnel and equipment: civilians are excluded; but this has necessarily given way, under the impact of modern developments, to a widening scale of interrelation between the army and civilians, either as private individuals or as public; and what is to be decided is whether the steps taken were within or beyond the range of what could reasonably be said to have been authorized for recruiting purposes.\nRelevant rules are to be found in a compilation of \"Regulations governing Military Operated Vehicles, 1947,\" published in December of that year but effective at the time of the accident. For instance, there is s. 22 which, in part, reads:\u2014\nMilitary transport vehicles may be used to transport service personnel to sports fields, playgrounds and recreational centres, subject to the following conditions:\u2014\n* * *\n(d) Under no circumstances will civilians or persons other than service personnel be transported.\nS. 25(a) provides:\u2014\nCivilians will not be transported in military vehicles except under the following circumstances:\u2014\n* * *\n(d) Where adequate educational, shopping or entertainment facilities do not exist for dependents of officers and other ranks at units outside urban areas and public transportation is not available from unit boundaries, the Officer Commanding a Command may authorize the use of Service transport not required for other duties. Transport authorized shall carry dependents only between the unit and the nearest public transportation, or the nearest facilities, whichever is the closer. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) deal with civilians employed in the Department of National Defence, civilian contractors or their employees engaged on work for the Department, and civilian official visitors, lecturers, members of committees acting for or in association with the Department, etc.\nSs. 27 and 28 provide:\u2014\nMembers of the Royal Canadian Cadet Corps may be permitted to ride in military transport vehicles when required to do so in connection with a duly authorized parade or authorized training activity.\n* * *\nAs the transportation of cadets in a military vehicle at any other time is not authorized, should the cadet be injured or killed while being transported other than on a parade or in the course of training as set out above, sections 73 to 80 inclusive of the Regulations for the Cadet Services of Canada, 1942, would not apply to provide compensation and medical treatment as set out therein. The liability of the Department in such a case would be merely that of the owner of a vehicle to a gratuitous passenger.\nNow the team did not make the trip as cadets nor as substitutes for cadets, nor was it in any sense a cadet or service activity such as is contemplated either by the Militia Act or the regulations. The trip was an act of an extra-service nature, of which the most that can be said is that it was promoted by the Commanding Officer for the indirect purpose mentioned. That being so, the act was either within or beyond the scope of the officer's authority: there is no room for the suggestion of carrying out an authorized act in a forbidden manner.\nThe trip would necessarily involve the expenses of the conveyance: could they be incurred, say, by hiring a bus on behalf of the Government? There is nothing before us either express or by implication of any sort or description to warrant the conclusion that they could be, nor that, in the face of these regulations, the lorry could be used for such a purpose. Voluntary recruitment has for generations been the object of local inducement and encouragement; but, so far as they have not been private, they have always been by way of military displays or advertisements in which the authorities preserved an exclusively military action. If the Commanding Officer could send a private baseball team over 50 miles in a military lorry as a military proceeding, I see no limit to the kind of activity, whether of sports, dancing, music, dramatics, or any other mode of arousing the interest and enthusiasm of young people, that could be resorted to in a similar manner. Such an extension of governmental action must find its authority in something more specific than the informal approval by general officers of stimulation to local enlistment.\nCameron J. found against the Crown on the ground that since the corporal was bound to execute the orders of the Commanding Officer, the act of driving was within the course of his employment. He founded himself on the case of Irwin v. Waterloo Taxicab Company Limited 32. There a taxi driver carried out the instruction of the General Manager of the business in driving him to see private friends, not on the business of the company. The driver had no reason to believe that the trip was not properly authorized, and it was made in a manner indistinguishable from the ordinary course of his work. But it was agreed that the driver was under a duty to obey the direction and to make the trip, and the Court of Appeal held the company liable for his negligence during the course of it.\nThe decision raises the question whether, if the General Manager himself had taken over the wheel and had driven the automobile on the same errand, the company would have been liable: if not, how the General Manager could raise the liability of the company through an order to the driver I find it difficult to see. In this I assume that the General Manager's authority extended so far as to enable him, if on an occasion he saw fit, and in the course of his employer's business, to drive the car himself. Moreover, there does not appear to have been any prohibition against the General Manager being a passenger, subject of course to the payment of the regular fare.\nThe fact that the servant there was bound to obey the order given him distinguishes the case from this. Here, the only order the corporal was bound in law to obey was a lawful order. It may be that, in his own interest, he was quite justified in obeying it and he would incur no discipline or responsibility for so doing; and it is clear that the special character of military relations necessitates such a justification except where the order is patently illegal. But that does not make the act done the act of the Crown. If Col. Reid himself had driven the lorry, he would not, in my opinion, have bound the Crown even though he could have done so in the course of admittedly military purposes. If that is sound, how he could engage the Crown's responsibility by ordering a subordinate to do the same act I am quite unable to appreciate.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout if they are demanded.\nKellock J.:\u2014Negligence on the part of the driver of the military vehicle here in question being no longer in question, the determination of this appeal depends solely on whether or not that negligence occurred while the driver was \"acting within the scope of his duties or employment\" within the meaning of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. Mr. Jackett relies upon the regulations to which he referred in support of his contention that the vehicle could not, at the relevant time, be considered as having been engaged upon any business of the Crown. The evidence of Colonel Simmons, called on behalf of the Crown, furnishes, however, an additional standpoint from which this appeal must be considered.\nAccording to this witness, during the period when the event here in question took place, both the Reserve and Active forces of the Canadian Army were in the \"throes\" of recruiting; \"the war had finished in 1945 and we were stepping up the Reserve Forces and Permanent Forces.\"\nWith respect to the regulations as to the use of military vehicles, the witness said: \"Certain things are taken for granted, that we could use a vehicle for recruiting.\" In particular he testified:\nQ. I believe you told my friend on cross-examination that there was nothing within your knowledge in these regulations to prohibit the use of a military-operated vehicle for recruiting? Is that what you said?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Well, not authorizing the use of one of these vehicles for recruiting purposes, would a Commanding Officer still be subject to the limitations of the use of that vehicle imposed by these Regulations?\nA. Not necessarily. If it is agreed or authorized that the\u2014there is nothing in these Regulations which says a vehicle cannot be used for a purpose, and if it is agreed that it is a recruiting purpose, the vehicle can be used, and it would be quite all right, naturally. With respect to the regulations themselves, the Crown relies in the first place upon Order 4558 of June 7, 1944, and particularly upon para. 3, which limits the use of army vehicles to \"official purposes.\" The interpretation of this order is not unaffected by paras. 1 and 2 from which it appears that the order arose out of the then existing shortage of gasoline \"in order to achieve economy.\" In my opinion, the use of a vehicle for recruiting purposes, particularly in the light of the evidence of Colonel Simmons, would be a use for an \"official\" purpose, and the commanding officer, to whom was committed the duty of recruiting his regiment up to its establishment, would of necessity have to judge as to what use would or would not be proper for such purpose, in the absence of some express provision with which any proposed use would be in conflict.\nColonel Reid considered that in what he directed he was carrying out his instructions with respect to increasing the strength of the regiment under his command. In the methods adopted by him to that end, he necessarily had a considerable discretion. If, therefore, there could be found a direct prohibition as to the use of transport vehicles in connection with recruiting, the question would arise as to whether disobedience would limit the \"sphere of the employment\" or merely amount to \"a direction not to do certain things, or to do them in a certain way within the sphere of the employment;\" Plumb v. Cobden 33, per Lord Dunedin at 67. If it were necessary to decide that question, I should say that the sphere of employment was not affected by the disobedience, if any, of Colonel Reid, and that, therefore, the particular regulations to which we were referred, notably with respect to the use of military vehicles for the transport of \"service personnel for recreational purposes,\" the transport of \"civilians employed by the Army,\" \"prospective recruits\" and cadets, do not assist the appellant.\nIf there were doubt as to whether or not this should be considered to be the right result, there would still be, in my opinion, a further question, namely, as to the duty of the driver of the vehicle when the order from Colonel Reid was given to him. In Keighly v. Bell 34, Willes J. expressed himself thus:\nI believe that the better opinion is, that an officer or soldier, acting under the orders of a superior\u2014not being necessarily or manifestly illegal \u2014would be justified by his orders.\nIt is obvious that the object with which an order is given can determine its lawfulness. An officer going on military-duty orders a soldier to fetch his horse. This would be a valid order. If, however, the officer wanted his horse to go hunting or to take an ordinary ride for pleasure, this would take the order out of the category of \"lawful\" commands.\nThe authors of the Manual of Military Law, 1929 edition, p. 18, express the view that\nSo long as the orders of the superior are not obviously and decidedly in opposition to the law of the land, the duty of the soldier is to obey and (if he thinks fit) to make a formal complaint afterwards.\nA similar view prevails in the United States. In Davis on \"The Military Law of the United States,\" a former Judge Advocate General, in speaking of \"lawful\" orders of a superior officer, says at p. 381:\nIf a question arises with respect to their legality, and the order is not on its face clearly and obviously in contravention of law, it is the duty of the inferior to resolve such doubt in favour of obedience, relying for justification on the form of the order so received and obeyed.\nIn my opinion, the law is sufficiently stated for the purposes of the case in hand by Willes J. above. Even in time of peace, military discipline could not otherwise be maintained.\nIf Colonel Reid in good faith, as he did, considered in giving the order here in question that he was carrying out his duty as commanding officer of the regiment in connection with the current effort to bring it up to strength, it is impossible to say that the Corporal who received the order to drive the vehicle should have considered he had received an unlawful order.\nWith respect to s. 117 of the Militia Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 132, it may be that illegality in fact would constitute a defence to any proceeding under that section, but I do not think that that section establishes the proposition that illegality in fact is sufficient to establish that a soldier, in carrying out a command of a superior officer, is not acting within the scope of his duties or employment within the meaning of the Exchequer Court Act, if the order is not \"necessarily or manifestly\" illegal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J. :\u2014The suppliants Bradshaw and Spence, respectively owner and driver of a taxicab, were awarded damages against Her Majesty in the Exchequer Court for injuries suffered when the taxicab collided with an Army truck upon a highway between Charlottetown and Souris, Prince Edward Island, about 1:30 on the morning of July 24, 1947.\nThe learned trial judge found that Corporal Ryan's negligent driving of the Army truck was the sole cause of the collision and no appeal is taken therefrom.\nThe Army truck was, at all times material hereto, in possession of the 17th Prince Edward Island Reconnaissance (RECCE) Regiment, a reserve unit of the Canadian Army then under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Reid. Corporal Ryan was a member thereof. As such, for the purpose of determining the liability of Her Majesty in this action, both Lieutenant Colonel Reid and Corporal Ryan are deemed to be servants of the Crown (Exchequer Court Act, S. of C. 1923, c. 25 s. 50A). The essential issue is, therefore, whether Corporal Ryan, at the time the injuries were suffered, was acting within the scope of his employment within the meaning of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34).\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n* * *\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nLieutenant Colonel Reid, with the intention of promoting recruiting, arranged for a ball game between the Regiment-sponsored RECCE junior team of Charlottetown and a local Souris team to be played at Souris on July 23, 1947. The RECCE team, for some reason, could not make the trip and Lieutenant Colonel Reid arranged that the Knights of Columbus, another junior team that played in the same league with the RECCE team at Charlottetown, would substitute. He directed their transportation in an Army truck and the injuries here claimed for were suffered while the Army truck was transporting the ball team and its suppprters back to Charlottetown.\nAs Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Reid was authorized to promote and was at all times material hereto promoting recruiting. As one witness stated, the Regiment was then in the \"throes of recruiting.\" There were no regulations dealing with recruiting and it must follow that as Commanding Officer it was his duty to exercise his discretion in the development of a programme that he might deem applicable and effective in the area allotted to him. As Lieutenant Colonel Rogers, then second in command, deposed:\nThe policy of the Regiment in regard to recruiting was we were given certain areas in Queen's and King's counties, in which we were permitted to recruit, and we were to use the means at our disposal to interest young lads into joining the Reserve Army.\nAs part of the recruiting programme Lieutenant Colonel Reid concluded that good will should be maintained between the Army and the civilian population and had, as a consequence, upon different occasions transported the regimental band for entertainment. As he states, they were told at all times \"to co-operate with civilian people.\" He accordingly arranged a ball game at Souris with a view to demonstrating to the young men that the Army was interested in many activities including sport and thereby to add to their interest in the Army. In all this he was not serving any purpose of his own or any ulterior or other purpose inconsistent with his position and duty to promote recruiting. (Whatever suggestion was made to the contrary was not established by the evidence.) Even if it be admitted he was in error, the evidence justifies no other conclusion but that he believed he was promoting recruiting and acting within the scope of his authority.\nA servant may, of course, while purporting to act for his master, do so in a manner that is outside the scope of his employment, but the conduct here in question is not sufficiently far removed to justify such a conclusion. The learned trial judge did not go further than to suggest \"it is difficult to agree with his opinion that the game actually played by the Knights of Columbus team had anything to do\" with the subsequent enlistments from Souris. That, however, is far from saying that Lieutenant Colonel Reid was not, in arranging the game, acting within the scope of his employment in the promotion of his recruiting programme.\nThe learned trial judge did find that the direction to use the Army truck for the transportation of this ball team \"was contrary to the regulations and that Colonel Reid had no authority to use it for such purposes,\" and continued:\nI do not question his good faith in the matter. At the time he was busily engaged in an effort to secure recruits for his regiment, and doubtless thought that an exhibition baseball game, between a team sponsored by the Regiment and the young men of Souris, would assist in recruiting.\nWith the greatest possible respect, it would appear that in the foregoing sufficient weight has not been given to the distinction between the field of actual authority and the scope of employment. Lord Esher gives expression to this distinction when he states:\nThe liability of the master does not rest merely on the question of authority, because the authority given is generally to do the master's business rightly; but the law says that if, in course of carrying out his employment, the servant commits an excess beyond the scope of his authority, the master is liable. Dyer v. Munday 35.\nThis difference is again emphasized in Story on Agency, s. 452:\n* * * he (the principal) is held liable to third persons in a civil suit for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances, and omissions of duty, of his agent, in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or, indeed, know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them. Bright & Co. v. Kerr 36.\nThe foregoing statement of the learned author has been repeatedly quoted, particularly in McGowan & Co. Ltd. v. Dyer 37; Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. 38; Percy v. Corporation of City of Glasgow 39. See also Willes J. in Bayley v. Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Ry. Co. 40.\nIn W. W. Sales Limited v. City of Edmonton 41, it is pointed out that the mere fact the agent's act may constitute a criminal offence does not necessarily take it outside the scope of his employment. Mr. Justice Hudson, delivering the judgment of the majority of this Court, stated at 471:\nHere the servants were \"not on a frolic of their own.\" They were in fact doing work which was intended to be of service to their master and was in fact closely connected with acts which they were specifically instructed to do.\nWhere it was contended that because the conduct of the servant in repossessing a bedstead constituted a criminal assault he was, therefore, acting beyond the scope of his employment, Lord Esher stated:\nThe question, therefore, for the jury was whether Price was employed to get back the bedstead, and did the acts complained of for the purpose of furthering that employment, and not for private purposes of his own * * * * Dyer v. Munday supra at 746.\nThe same view is adopted in Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo 42, where, although the servant committed an act of trespass, that did not take his conduct outside the scope of his employment.\nLimpus v. The General Omnibus Co. 43, was regarded by Compton J. at 643\nas a case of improper driving and not a case in which the servant did anything altogether inconsistent with the discharge of his duty to his master and out of the course of his employment\u2014a fact upon which, it appears to me, the case turns.\nThe appellant cited among other authorities Halparin v. Bulling 44, Battistoni v. Thomas 45, and Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Limited 46. The servant in all of these cases had left his master's business and was proceeding toward the attainment of a purpose of his own. The case of Poulton v. The L. & S.W. Ry. Co. 47, was also cited. There the conduct of the servant was ultra vires the master, which raised questions not relevant hereto, as there is no question of ultra vires in the instant case.\nSection 50A of the Exchequer Court Act creates a relationship of master and servant between Her Majesty and a member of the Army. It thereby imposes a liability upon Her Majesty equal to that of the member of the Army for damage negligently caused by the latter while acting within the scope of his employment. The King v. Anthony 48. The phrase \"scope of employment,\" because it must so largely depend upon the circumstances in each case, has generally been conceded to be incapable of precise definition. The foregoing authorities do indicate that it is wider than the field or scope of actual authority and that the purpose of the servant and the fact that he is not acting in a manner inconsistent with his employment may be factors in determining scope of employment. Further assistance may be found in a consideration of the remarks of Willes J. in Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank 49, where he states:\nIn all these cases it may be said, as it was said here, that the master has not authorized the act. It is true he has not authorized the particular act, but he has put the agent in his place to do that class of acts, and he must be answerable for the manner in which the agent has conducted himself in doing the business which it was the act of his master to place him in.\nQuoted with approval in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. supra, at 733. See also Hamlyn v. Houston & Co. 50.\nIn Lockhart v. C.P.R. 51, their Lordships of the Privy Council adopted the statement of Salmond on Torts, 9th Ed. p. 95, 10th Ed. p. 89:\nBut a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorized, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorized that they may rightly be regarded as modes\u2014although improper modes\u2014of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorizes his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it * * * On the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible; for in such a case, the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it.\nIt was the duty of Lieutenant Colonel Reid to direct, within the meaning of the regulations, the use of Army vehicles for military purposes, including that of recruiting. It is unnecessary to recite the regulations which were placed in evidence, as it must be conceded that a study of them leads to the conclusion that, in the promotion of his recruiting programme, Lieutenant Colonel Reid had not the authority to authorize the use of this Army truck to transport a civilian baseball team from Charlottetown to Souris. At the time he considered that because he was doing this in aid of recruiting that it was for an official purpose and, therefore, permissible within s. 20 of the regulations, which reads, in part:\n20. Military transport vehicles are to be used for official purposes only. * * * *\nThe problem here presented is not whether Lieutenant Colonel Reid exceeded his authority, but did he act outside the scope of his employment? He was serving no other purpose or interest in all that he did but that of his master and his conduct was not so far removed from the acts he was authorized to perform as to justify a conclusion that he was not, at all times, engaged in his master's undertaking. Upon the whole of the evidence, Lieutenant Colonel Reid, whose duty it was to direct these vehicles within the meaning of the regulations, upon this occasion misconstrued them, but even then his direction was so connected with those directions he was authorized to give that within the view expressed by Salmond and adopted by the Privy Council in Lockhart v. C.P.R., supra he was, in directing the use of this truck, acting within the scope of his employment.\nLieutenant Colonel Reid followed the usual routine of his Regiment and issued a Transport Work Ticket authorizing this trip. It was given to Sergeant Ryan who was in charge of the Army trucks. Sergeant Ryan communicated with his brother, Corporal Ryan, and as a result the latter, who was qualified to drive Army vehicles, proceeded to the garage and received his instructions. The truck was serviced and made ready for the trip by Sergeant Ryan. Corporal Ryan received, in the regular way, Army pay covering this trip. Both Sergeant Ryan and Corporal Ryan would know that the Regiment was in the throes of a recruiting campaign and if they had asked any question with regard to the purpose of this trip they would have been told it was in promotion of recruiting. Throughout, all three parties were acting within the scope of their employment at the time the injury for which damages are here claimed occurred.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. Locke J. (dissenting):\u2014The learned trial judge has found that the use of the Army truck to carry the Knights of Columbus baseball team to Souris and return on the day in question was contrary to regulations and that Colonel Reid had no authority to use it for such purposes, conclusions with which I respectfully agree. The general instructions given to the officer commanding the unit to endeavour to obtain recruits for his unit cannot be construed as authorizing the carrying on of such activities by means forbidden by Army orders.\nThere remains the question as to whether Corporal Ryan, who was driving the truck and whose negligence has been held to have caused the accident, was at the time acting \"within the scope of his duties or employment\" within the meaning of that expression in subsection (c) of s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34.\nColonel Reid was at the time the officer commanding the 17th Prince Edward Island Reconnaissance Regiment. Other than his statement that this was a Reserve unit of the Armoured Corps and the fact that it was not at the time undergoing its annual drill or training and had not been placed on active service, there is no evidence of its status. For the Crown the King's Regulations and Orders of 1939 were tendered in evidence and admitted, with the consent of counsel for the respondent, from which it must be taken that these were the general regulations and orders which applied to members of this unit at the time of the occurrence in question. By Order 1 the Reserve Militia, of which the unit apparently formed part prior to the amendments to the Militia Act enacted by c. 21 of the Statutes of 1947, was organized in the manner defined by Appendix 10 which declared that the organization of the Reserve Militia was authorized subject to regulations prescribed by the Governor in Council under s. 16 of the Militia Act. The reference to s. 16 is to the Act as it appeared as c. 41, R.S.C. 1906. In the revision of 1927 it appeared as s. 14.\nBy the amendment of 1947 the designation of the various military forces of Canada as Militia was altered and all the military forces of Canada other than the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Reserves thereof were named the Canadian Army, divided into the active force consisting of that portion that is on continuous full time military service, such other military units then existing which had been theretofore constituted and such other units as might thereafter be named and authorized by the Minister under the provisions of s. 20 of the Act as amended. The Reserve Militia mentioned in Order 1 and Appendix 10 of the 1939 King's Regulations and Orders is not mentioned by name. Upon the evidence in the present record, a unit such as the Prince Edward Island Reconnaissance Regiment was maintained and continued as a reserve unit of the Canadian Army and this was its status at the time in question.\nThis being so, the question as to whether Corporal Ryan was under any duty to obey the order of the commanding officer of the unit to drive the truck at that time is not free from doubt. According to Regulation No. 9 which forms part of Appendix 10 to the King's Regulations and Orders, drill and training for the members of such units is voluntary. Regulation 11 declares that the Government does not undertake to provide the Reserve Militia, except when called out on active service, with any equipment, and they are not entitled to transportation, subsistence, pay or allowances, except while on active service. The oath taken by every officer and man on joining such a unit, in addition to containing an oath of allegiance to His Majesty, includes the oath to \"well and truly serve His Majesty in the Reserve Militia of Canada under the terms and conditions laid down in the law and the regulations duly made from time to time in that behalf.\" Corporal Ryan's regiment, as has been stated, was neither on active service nor undergoing its annual drill or training, nor had the service he was called upon to perform by the order of Colonel Reid transmitted to him by Sergeant Ryan anything to do with the annual drill or training of the unit under the provisions of the Act. It is difficult to conclude, therefore, that when, according to the regulations, attendance at drill or training was voluntary and Corporal Ryan, according to Regulation 12, was not entitled to any pay except while on active service, he was under any obligation to obey an order to drive the baseball team to Souris, if these were the regulations then in force in regard to his unit. While the regulations thus applicable to the unit contained these provisions, s. 115 of the Act provided a penalty for:\u2014\nEvery officer and man of the Militia who, without lawful excuse, neglects or refuses to attend any parade or drill or training at the place and hour appointed therefor, or who refuses or neglects to obey any lawful order at or concerning such parade, drill or training.\nThis section remained unalterated by the amendment of 1947 other than by striking out the word \"militia\" and substituting the words \"Canadian Army\" which, by the defining section, included a reserve unit such as this. The question is perhaps affected by s. 69 of the Militia Act, as enacted by the 1947 amendment, which includes a provision that all officers and men of the Canadian Army shall be subject to \"all laws, regulations and orders relating to the Canadian Army\" when, inter alia, they are within any armoury or other place where arms, guns, ammunition or other military stores are kept since, while the order to take the truck from Charlottetown to Souris and return was communicated to Sergeant Ryan by Colonel Reid by telephone and he received the work order which authorized the use of the vehicle elsewhere, Corporal Ryan took delivery of the truck and received at least part of his instructions from Sergeant Ryan at an armoury. There appears thus to be a conflict between these sections of the Militia Act and the regulations affecting Reserve units such as this. In view of the fact that the regulations were clearly authorized by section 14 of the statute, as it was before the amendment, it may well be contended that the words \"Canadian Army\" in section 115, as amended, should be construed as applicable to units other than those of the Reserve Militia which were affected by the regulations contained in Appendix 10 to the King's Regulations and Orders. I find it unnecessary to come to a conclusion on the point, in view of the opinion that I have formed that in any event Corporal Ryan owed no duty to obey an order to do something prohibited by the regulations.\nThe truck or lorry driven by Ryan had been issued to the 28th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and, according to Colonel Reid, it had been \"loaned\" to him for the purpose of making this trip. The regulations for the employment of military vehicles at the time provided that transport vehicles were to be used for official purposes only and, while by Regulation 22 they might be used to transport service personnel to sports fields, play grounds and recreation centres, this was permissible only in the case of properly authorized and organized military sports and, in the case of these, the use of transport for such purposes, for distances in excess of twenty miles, was allowed only on the authority of the Quartermaster General at Army Headquarters or the general officer commanding of the command concerned, and its use for carrying civilians or persons other than service personnel was prohibited. The vehicle in question was not being used for official purposes at the time of the accident nor for the purpose of transporting service personnel to authorized or organized military sports: the distance between Souris and Charlottetown is fifty-three miles and permission to use the truck for a journey of this extent had neither been asked nor granted. If it be assumed for the purpose of argument that Corporal Ryan was obligated by the terms of his enlistment and the obligations imposed upon him by the Militia Act and the King's Regulations and Orders to obey an order of the commanding officer of the unit, communicated to him in an armoury, when such unit had neither been placed on active service nor was engaged in its annual drill or training under the provisions of the Militia Act, his only obligation was to obey a lawful order.\nThe oath required of Ryan on admission to the Reserve Militia under Regulation 15 of Appendix 10 of the King's Regulations and Orders was to serve under the terms and conditions laid down in the law and the regulations duly made from time to time in that behalf. The penalties authorized by the Militia Act for disobedience are for the failure or refusal to obey any lawful order, not any order which a superior officer may see fit to give. While, as pointed out by Hudson, J. in Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Limited 52, the question as to whether a given act of an employee is within the scope of his employment, in the sense in which that phrase is used for the purpose of determining the employer's liability to third persons, is strictly not the same question as to whether an injury received by an employee was an injury received in the course of his employment for the purpose of applying the Workmen's Compensation Act, nevertheless judicial reasoning in respect of the latter class of questions may be valuable and illuminating. In Bourton v. Beauchamp 53, where a claim was made under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906 by reason of the death of a miner killed in doing an act prohibited by statutory regulation under the Coal Mines Act 1911, it was held that the deceased in disobeying the statutory regulation was acting outside the sphere of his employment and that, consequently, his death was not caused by an act arising out of or in the course of his employment. To the same effect is Moore v. Donnelly 54. The reasoning applied in arriving at the conclusions of the House of Lords seems to me applicable in the present matter and accordingly that in performing an act forbidden by the regulations Corporal Ryan was not \"acting within the scope of his duties or employment\" within the meaning of subsection (c) of s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act. The learned trial judge considered that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Irwin v. Waterloo Taxicab Co. Ltd. 55, should be applied in the circumstances of the present case but, with respect, I am unable to agree. In that case, Bird, the driver of the taxicab had been instructed to obey orders given to him by Black, the general manager of the taxicab company, and at the time of the accident he was complying with an order which, as shown in the judgment of Buckley L.J., he was by the defendant's directions bound to obey. In the present matter, the obligation of the soldier is limited by the statute and the regulations to obedience to lawful orders. The decision in Irwin's case does not, therefore, seem to me in point. If it were it would be necessary, in my opinion, to decide whether the case was rightly decided, a debatable question, to my mind.\nIt may be said that if officers and men of the Canadian Army were entitled to question the validity of orders given to them by their superiors, it would be destructive of military discipline. This argument was advanced in Heddon v. Evans 56, where an action was brought against an officer who had sentenced a soldier to fourteen days' confinement to barracks for conduct which was said to be to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, the plaintiff contending that the officer imposing the punishment had exceeded his jurisdiction. McCardie J. pointed out that the compact or burden of a man who entered the Army, voluntary or not, was that he would submit to military law, not that he would submit to military illegality; that he must accept the Army Act and Rules and Regulations and Orders and all that they involved, since these \"expressed his obligations and announced his military rights.\" Dealing with the argument that if such actions were permitted it would injuriously affect the discipline of the Army, he said that he would not think this was so since he could not think that discipline would be the less readily exerted or the less loyally accepted if it were subjected at all times to the limitations created by the military law itself. Even if the contrary were so, I think this would not affect the matter to be here decided, which is the determination of a question of law depending upon the construction to be given to the regulations and the statutes. In Keighly v. Bell 57, a military officer claimed damages from his commander for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and libel. Willes J. in the course of the argument, in referring to the contention of the defendant that what he had done in the matter had been authorized or approved by his superiors, said in part (p. 790) :\u2014\nI hope I may never have to determine that difficult question, how far the orders of a superior officer are a justification. Were I compelled to determine that question, I should probably hold that the orders are an absolute justification in time of actual war\u2014at all events, as regards enemies, or foreigners\u2014and, I should think, even with regard to English-born subjects of the Crown, unless the orders were such as could not legally be given. I believe that the better opinion is, that an officer or soldier, acting under the orders of his superior\u2014not being necessarily or manifestly illegal\u2014would be justified by his orders.\nLater, in delivering judgment, he said in part (p. 805) :\u2014\nIf it were necessary to state any principle on which it would be competent to me to decide such a case, it would be that a soldier, acting honestly in the discharge of his duty\u2014that is, acting in obedience to the orders of his commanding officers\u2014is not liable for what he does, unless it be shown that the orders were such as were obviously illegal. He must justify any direct violation of the personal rights of another person by showing, not only that he had orders, but that the orders were such as he was bound to obey. The statement first above quoted appears to me on the face of it to be simply obiter and neither of the passages appear to me to deal directly with the question to be decided here, as to whether obedience to an unlawful order lies within the scope of the duties of a soldier.\nI am further of the opinion that the matter is not affected by the fact that Corporal Ryan may not have been aware of the true extent of the duty imposed upon him by the terms of his employment, by the Militia Act and by the King's Regulations and Orders and may have thought that he was in duty bound to obey the order in question. To impose liability upon the Crown the conditions of the section of the Exchequer Court Act must be met. I am unable, with respect for contrary opinions, to understand how the scope of his duties and employment could be extended by his mistaken understanding as to what they were (Wardle v. Enthoven 58).\nI would allow this appeal and direct that the action be dismissed with costs throughout if they are demanded.\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from two judgments of Cameron J. whereby it was adjudged that the suppliants Spence and Bradshaw were respectively entitled to recover damages in the amounts of $10,318.85 and $750, resulting from a collision which occurred on the 24th of July, 1947 between a taxi-cab, owned by Bradshaw and operated by Spence, and an army truck, the property of the appellant, driven by Corporal H. W. Ryan.\nThe learned trial judge found on conflicting evidence that the sole cause of the collision was the negligence of Corporal Ryan and neither this finding nor the assessment of damages was questioned before us.\nIn the statement of defence in each case it is admitted that at the time of the collision \"a motor vehicle, the property of His Majesty the King, as vested in the Minister of National Defence, was being driven by one Corporal Harrison W. Ryan, No. F403452, a servant of His Majesty the King in the employ of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (Reserve)\" but it is pleaded that Corporal Ryan, at the time of the collision, was not acting within the scope of his duties or employment. The question for determination is whether or not he was so acting. The relevant facts for the purposes of this appeal may be briefly stated as follows:\nAt the time of the collision Corporal Ryan was a non- commissioned officer in the Canadian Army and a member of the 17th P.E.I. Reconnaissance Regiment with Head quarters at Charlottetown. This regiment did not form part of the active force and Corporal Ryan was not on full-time military service. The Commanding Officer of this regiment was Lieutenant-Colonel Reid. The vehicle in question was a 60-cwt. truck which had been issued to the 28th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. The Commanding Officer of that regiment had loaned the vehicle to Lieutenant-Colonel Reid and counsel for the appellant did not argue that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid did not have the lawful custody of the vehicle or that he would not have been entitled to use it for any lawfully authorized military purpose connected with the regiment under his command.\nLieutenant-Colonel Reid testified that he had received orders, which were not in writing, to do all that he could to build up the strength of his unit by securing recruits from an area which included Souris, a small town about fifty-three miles from Charlottetown, that he thought that it would tend to encourage recruiting if he arranged an \"exhibition\" baseball game between a team of young men at Souris and a team sponsored by his regiment and composed of members of the Queen's Square School Cadet Corps which was affiliated with his regiment and that, with this end in view, he made arrangements for such a game, intending to transport the Cadet Corps team from Charlottetown to Souris in an army truck. For reasons which do not appear the Cadet Corps team was unable to play this game. Lieutenant-Colonel Reid considered that the failure to send a team after the game had been arranged would have a bad effect on the purpose which he was seeking to accomplish, that is to encourage recruiting, and made arrangements that a team sponsored by the Knights of Columbus and which was in the same league as the Cadet Corps team should make the trip to Souris and play the game in place of the last mentioned team. He accordingly instructed Sergeant Ryan, a member of his regiment who was at the time on full-time military service to call in Corporal Ryan and to instruct him to make the trip. A \"Transport Work Ticket\" authorizing the trip was made out, was signed by Lieutenant-Colonel Reid and was given by him to Sergeant Ryan. On Corporal Ryan arriving at the armoury in response to the call which he had received, Sergeant Ryan handed him the \"Transport Work Ticket\", which showed on its face that the trip to be taken was from Charlottetown to Souris, and ordered him to pick up the Knights of Columbus team, to drive them to Souris and, after the game and such entertainment as had been arranged for the visiting team were over, to drive the team back to Charlottetown. It was on the return trip that the collision occurred.\nIt was proved that Corporal Ryan was an experienced driver and that \"he had standing orders\", which expression was explained to mean that he had the permanent status of a duly qualified driver of army vehicles. On previous occasions when Corporal Ryan had been called upon by his Commanding Officer to drive an army vehicle he had been paid out of the public treasury and he was to be so paid for the trip in question.\nThese being the facts, it would seem clear that the order to make the trip was given to Corporal Ryan at a time while he was upon military duty and within an armoury and that it was his duty to obey it provided it was a lawful order. This follows from Sections 69(2) and 117 of the Militia Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 132 as amended by 1947, 11 George VI, c. 21, sections 22 and 34(1). The relevant portions of these sections provide as follows:\u2014\n69(2) Officers and men of the Active Force and members of the permanent staff of the Canadian Army shall at all times be subject to all laws, regulations and orders relating to the Canadian Army and all other officers and men of the Canadian Army shall be subject to such laws, regulations and orders.\n* * *\n(c) at any time while upon military duty .... or within any armoury * * * *\n117. Every officer and man of the Canadian Army who disobeys any lawful order of his superior officer * * * shall incur a penalty * * * * Indeed, I did not understand counsel for the appellant to argue that if the order had been to drive the truck for some purpose authorized by the relevant regulations it would not have been Corporal Ryan's duty to carry it out.\nThe main argument on behalf of the appellant is that under the relevant legislation, regulations and orders, Lieutenant-Colonel Reid had no authority to make use of the truck for the purpose described, that, while Corporal Ryan was under a duty to obey the lawful orders of his superior officer, the order given to him was unlawful and that consequently in driving the truck pursuant to such order he was not acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe learned trial judge found that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid was acting throughout in good faith and in the belief that he was entitled to use the truck as he did but that he was mistaken and that under the relevant orders he had no authority to use the truck for this purpose and committed a breach of the regulations regarding the use of military vehicles in so doing. The learned trial judge was, however, of opinion that Corporal Ryan was acting within the scope of his duties or employment, that it was his duty to drive army vehicles in accordance with the orders which he received from his superior officers, that this was what he was doing at the time of the collision and that consequently the appellant is liable for the damages resulting from his negligent driving.\nCounsel for the respondents seeks to support the judgment on the grounds stated by the learned trial judge but he also argues that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid was entitled to use the truck for the purpose mentioned. He submits that the only order or regulation properly proved, and in any case the only one having relevance, was that contained in Exhibit B, Order No. 4558 said to have been issued by the Quartermaster General, and that the only provision in such order which has a bearing on the case at bar is the sentence:\u2014\"Army vehicles are to be used for official purposes only.\" He then argues that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid's purpose was an official one, that he had been ordered to do everything in his power to encourage recruiting, that, in view of section 138 of the Militia Act, it is unimportant that he had no written orders to this effect and that the encouragement of recruiting, having been ordered, became an official purpose. He submits that as, so far as the record discloses, the regulations are silent as to how this purpose should be carried out it must be taken to be left to the reasonable discretion of the Commanding Officer concerned. In support of this view counsel made reference to the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Simmons, called by the appellant. This officer stated that his duties included general supervision over the operation of military vehicles in the charge of the various units in the Eastern Command, reserve force and active force, although the primary responsibility for the use of such vehicles rested with the Officer Commanding each unit. Colonel Simmons said in part:\u2014\nYou are asking a simple question, \"could a vehicle be used for recruiting purposes\", and I would say \"yes\". My answer would be \"yes\".\nOf course, these officers could not by their evidence relieve the court of its duty to construe the relevant regulations but, as I understand it, their evidence was not tendered for this purpose but rather to show what orders were in fact received and what practice was actually followed in a matter not expressly dealt with in the regulations, i.e., the encouraging of recruiting. It is clear that if accepted, the argument that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid was authorized to use the vehicle for the purpose mentioned and was giving a lawful order to Corporal Ryan when he ordered him to drive the truck as he did, is sufficient to dispose of the appeal in favour of the respondents. I do not find it necessary to pass finally upon this argument and will only say that the question appears to me to be a doubtful and difficult one.\nFor the purposes of this appeal I will assume, without deciding, that the learned trial judge was right in holding that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid did not have authority to send the truck to this particular destination and for this particular purpose. The question then is whether, on this assumption, Corporal Ryan was acting within the scope of his duties or employment at the time of the collision, for it was his negligence which caused injury to the suppliants. The effect of the conflicting views put forward may be summarized as follows. For the appellant it is urged that the duty of Corporal Ryan was limited to driving army vehicles for such purposes as might be authorized by the relevant statutes, regulations and orders in force at the time of the accident, that since, ex hypothesi, driving the truck to Souris for the purposes mentioned was not authorized by such regulations his act in driving it there fell outside the scope of his duties and that the fact that he was ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Reid to drive the truck to Souris is irrelevant as Corporal Ryan's duty did not include obedience to the orders of his Commanding Officer unless they were lawful. For the respondents it is argued that the duty of Corporal Ryan, who was admittedly on the day of the accident a servant of the Crown, was to drive army vehicles, that it was no part of his duty to decide to what places or for what purposes such vehicles should be driven but that as to this he was to obey the orders given to him by his superior officers, provided that such orders were not ex facie unlawful and (perhaps) provided further that the orders were not such as a reasonable man in Corporal Ryan's position should have realized were unlawful.\nI have reached the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case it was Corporal Ryan's duty to obey the order which he received and that in driving the truck to and from Souris in obedience to that order he was acting within the scope of his duty. This view appears to me to be supported by the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-cab Company, Limited 59, relied upon and followed by the learned trial judge. In that case one Bird was employed by the defendant Taxi-cab Company to drive its taxi-cabs. He was instructed by his employer to obey the orders of the General Manager, Black, and to drive the cabs as directed by him. Black ordered Bird to drive one of the taxi-cabs on what was clearly as between Black and the Company a frolic of his own but it was found that this fact was not known to Bird and that the circumstances were not such that he ought reasonably to have known it. While so driving Bird negligently struck and injured the plaintiff. It was held that the Company was liable for Bird's negligence although it is, I think, clear from the judgments that had Black himself been driving the Company would not have been liable. We were not referred to any subsequent decision in which this judgment has been doubted and with respect I agree with it.\nIn the case at bar I think it clear that Corporal Ryan did not know that Lieutenant-Colonel Reid had no right to give him the order which he gave nor do I think that it can be said on the evidence that as a reasonable man Corporal Ryan should have known this. I have already indicated that, even after having had the advantage of hearing a full and able argument on the question, I am doubtful as to whether or not Lieutenant-Colonel Reid was authorized to give the order in question. It was not proved that any of the regulations or orders relied upon by the appellant as prohibiting Lieutenant-Colonel Reid from giving such an order had in fact been brought to Corporal Ryan's attention or had been published in such a manner that it became his duty to be aware of their contents. I do not think that there is any presumption that he knew their contents. In this connection reference may be made to the words of Lord Atkin in Evans v. Bartlam 60.\nFor my part I am not prepared to accept the view that there is in law any presumption that any one, even a judge, knows all the rules and orders of the Supreme Court. The fact is that there is not and never has been a presumption that every one knows the law. There is the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse, a maxim of very different scope and application.\nIt appears to me that to hold that it was not within the duty of Corporal Ryan to obey the order given to him in this case by his superior officers would tend to bring about a condition of confusion. I cannot assent to the proposition that where a non-commissioned officer or man whose duty it is to drive army vehicles receives from his Commanding Officer an order, not obviously unlawful, to drive a vehicle to a particular place and for a particular purpose he must, before obeying the order, conduct an inquiry of his own as to whether the order is lawful. In Hodgkinson v. Fernie 61, in his charge to the jury at page 421, Cockburn C.J. said:\u2014\nThere would be an end to all subordination, military or naval, if the officer subordinate in command were to take upon himself to decide upon the merits of the order, before he obeyed it.\nThis charge was approved on a motion for a new trial by a court consisting of Cockburn C.J. and Creswell, Crowder and Willes JJ.\nIn the case at bar counsel for the appellant does not suggest that Corporal Ryan should have questioned the merits of the order he received. The suggestion is that he should have questioned its legality. But where there is nothing on the face of an order or in the surrounding circumstances to indicate that it is unlawful the effect of holding that the subordinate should question its legality before obeying it would, I think, result in no less confusion than would permitting him to decide upon its merits.\nWe are not called upon in this case to consider the duty of a soldier who receives an order, in fact unlawful, in such circumstances that he ought reasonably to know it is unlawful and I wish to make it clear that I do not intend to decide anything in relation to such a situation.\nFor the reasons given by the learned trial judge on this branch of the matter and for the reasons set out above I am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Its members have taken the vows of poverty and receive no wages and any revenue is expended exclusively for the furtherance of the purposes of the Society. Girls are received regardless of their race or creed or ability to pay. The appellant owns real estate on which is erected a main building which provides accommodation for the inmates and includes a school and a public laundry and dry cleaning plant where the girls are taught habits of industry and fitted to earn a living. The plant is in public competition with commercial laundries. There is also on the property a two-family brick dwelling occupied by two male employees and their families. The men are employed as truck drivers. The appellant was incorporated in 1945 by a special act of the N.B. Legislature for the purpose of carrying out its objects as set out above and was authorized to purchase land and erect buildings for such purposes and as incidental thereto for the maintenance of the institution, to carry on the business of a steam and general laundry. The respondent assessed the laundry equipment, two motor trucks used in the business and the brick dwelling. The appellant claims exemption under s. 4(1) clauses (d) and (g).\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Cartwright JJ. dissenting).\n1. In construing s. 4(1), clause (g) must be regarded as a general clause and clause (d) as a particular clause and to avoid repugnancy or inconsistency (d) must be taken to be an exception to (g).\n2. The appellant is not a \"charitable society or institution\" within the meaning of clause (g); Cocks v. Manners L.R. 12 Eq. 574; In re White [1893] 2 Ch. 41; but a society of mixed objects, some charitable and some not, and must find exemption, if any, under clause (d).\n3. The use referred to in (d) is the actual use to which the property is put and not the object to which the profits from the business carried on may be devoted.\nPer Estey J. The equipment used in the conduct of the business serves not only the appellant organization, but the public generally. It therefore cannot be said to be \"used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes.\"\nPer: Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Cartwright JJ., dissenting\u2014Whether the word \"charitable\" as used in clause (g) is to be construed in its legal sense or in its natural and ordinary meaning, the appellant is a \"charitable society or institution,\" notwithstanding its operation of the laundry and dry-cleaning plant, within the meaning of those words as used in clause (g). Birtwistle Trust v. Minister of National Revenue [1938] Ex. C.R. 95 at 101; affirmed by [1940] A.C. 138; In re Douglas\u2014Obert v. Barrow 35 Ch. D 472 at 479 and 487. In the contemplation of the Legislature as expressed in the statute of incorporation the operation of the laundry business is merely incidental to the charitable purposes of the appellant and the maintenance thereof. This is not the case of an institution carrying on a commercial business and incidentally performing sundry charitable works or paying over its profits to others for charitable purposes, but of a society or institution of which all the primary purposes are purely charitable which is actively engaged on charitable works and as an incidental means of providing some of the money which is required for the prosecution of such charitable works carries on a business under its statutory powers. It is a charitable society or institution within the meaning of those words as used in clause (g) and it follows that all its property is exempt from taxation.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, Richards C.J. and Harrison J. (Hughes J. dissenting) 1dismissing an application by way of Certiorari by the appellant calling upon the respondent to show cause why an assessment upon the appellants' property in the Town of Sunny Brae should not be quashed.\nJohn Carvell for the appellant. If there is no evidence that rent is received for the brick dwelling house, then the finding that it is must be erroneous. The only evidence regarding the receipt of rent by the Society for any of its property appears in the affidavits of the Town Clerk and the Chairman of the Board of Assessors; these affidavits merely depose the fact that rent is paid for the dwelling \"or included in the salary or wages paid\" the employees who occupy it. Since the saving of expense by paying employees by supplying them a dwelling is not the receipt of rent, this alternative deposition is not evidence that rent is received. Therefore the finding that rent is received is erroneous and this building should be exempt from taxation.\nThe laundry and dry-cleaning equipment, and property used in conjunction therewith, which is the property of the Society, is exempt from taxation if it is used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes. The Rates and Taxes Act, s. 4(1) (d), which is made applicable by s. 75 of The Towns Incorporation Act. The finding that this property is not so used is erroneous. The property of the Society is used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes since these are the only purposes of the Society. In re House of the Good Shepherd of Omaha, House of the Good Shepherd of Omaha v. Board of Equalization of Douglas County 2. Where the incorporating statute of the Society provides that it may carry on the business of a general laundry etc. as \"incidental to\", meaning part of its philanthropic and educational purposes, it follows that the laundry and dry-cleaning equipment and property used in conjunction therewith is exempt from taxation.\nAll the property of the Society is exempt, regardless of its use, if it is the property of a charitable society. The Rates and Taxes Act s. 4(1) (g), which is made applicable by s. 75 of The Town Incorporation Act. It is wrong at law to rule that a religious society cannot claim exemption as a charitable society\u2014The Legislature has provided an exemption; the meaning of the words used is clear and should be given effect to. The ordinary sense of the words used leads to no absurdity, inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, or manifest injustice and does not require modification by the Judiciary. Re Linton & Sinclair Co. Ltd. 3; Pemsels' case 4. Charitable societies and religious societies do not necessarily belong to the same genus. The word \"religious\" may describe a society which is not a charitable society. Cocks v. Manners 5 In re Delaney 6. Obviously in this case where the Legislature dealt with the property of religious societies and charitable societies in separate exemptions it considered them to be distinct\u2014As gathered from the words used, the intention of the Legislature should be construed to be the subsidization of charitable societies carrying on business. Halifax v. Sisters of Charity 7. The ruling of the Court of Appeal can only be the result of adding a clause to the Statute, \"Provided that the property of a religious society shall not be deemed to be the property of a charitable society\"; this is manifestly in error. Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 9 Ed. p. 14-18.\nThe appellant is a charitable society since its object is the advancement of education, except in so far as this is tempered with the purpose of relieving poverty and advancing religion. All of these purposes are recognized by the law as charitable, according to the standard set by Lord Macnaghton in Pemsels' case, and since it does its work with philanthropic principles, not for the purpose of making a profit. Re the Township of King and the Marylake Industrial School and Farm Settlement Association 8. Therefore all the property of the appellant is exempt from taxation.\nJ. A. Creaghan K.C. for the respondent. Taxation is an act of Sovereignty to be performed as far as conscientiously can be with justice and equity to all and exemptions, no matter how meritorious, are of grace and must be construed strictly. In Ruthenian Catholic Mission v. Mundare School District 9, Iddington J. at p. 625 said: \"An exemption from taxation should never be carried further than what is beyond doubt the clearly expressed intention of the legislature * * * *\"\nIt is a general rule that while a taxing Act is to be construed strictly in favour of the taxpayer, a statute under which an exemption is claimed from a burden imposed upon the community at large is also to be narrowly construed against the claim for exemption. To claim exemption under s. 4(1) (d) the property must be used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes. Les Commissionaires etc. St. Gabriel v. Les Soeurs de la Congregation de Notre Dame de Montr\u00e9al 10; Evangelical Lutheran Synod v. Edmonton 11; L'Association Catholique etc. v. Chicoutimi 12 ; C.N.R. v. Capreol 13.\nSection 4(1) (d) expressly excludes real estate in respect of which rent is received.\nThe appellant does not come within the provisions of s. 4(1) (g). Richards C.J. \"There is no question as to the nature and purposes of the Society in question. It clearly comes within s. 4(1) (d) as a religious, philanthropic and educational institution rather than under s. 4(1) (g) as merely a literary or charitable society.\" (5) Harrison J. \"The society is, as stated by the Mother Superior, a religious organization, that is to say its purposes are conducive to the advancement of religion.\" 14. In re White 15 ; Re Ward v. Ward 16.\n\"As a religious organization the exemption of the property of this Society is governed by s. 4(1) (d). No doubt all religious organizations are classified as charitable under the legal definition of charity, but this class of charitable organization is specifically dealt with in the exemption clauses of The Rates and Taxes Act, and therefore this religious organization cannot claim exemption under the general description of charitable society found in clause 4(1) (g).\"\nIt is submitted these findings are correct. The same property could not be included in both clauses as the exemptions are different. Hughes J. in his dissenting judgment was at variance with the rules of construction he adopted in R. v. Mullin 17 and the cases cited by him at p. 308. It is submitted the interpretation there given was the proper one. See also Pemsel's case 18 per Lord Halsbury at 551: \"The fact however, remains, that in various statutes the word charitable is distinguished by the Legislature from 'public', 'educational', 'religious', and in no one instance that I have been able to find, do the words run 'or other charitable purpose', which one would think would be the natural mode of the meaning now insisted on.\" In Adamson v. Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works 19 Anglin C.J. in delivering judgment gave a restricted interpretation of the words \"charitable institutions.\"\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, discharging a rule nisi to quash the assessment made by the assessors of the Town of Sunny Brae against certain property of the appellant.\nThe appellant was incorporated by special act of the Province of New Brunswick being c. 94 of the Statutes of 1945.\nThe preamble to this Act reads as follows:\u2014\nWHEREAS the Religious Ladies established at Monoton and known as Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur, whose members aim at devoting themselves to the care and reformation of female penitents and the providing of a home for orphan children, have by their petition prayed that the institution may be incorporated in order that they may better accomplish the objects for which it was formed;\nSection 1 incorporates three sisters who are named \"and all members of 'Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur' and other religious forming the Council of the said Community their associates and successors\" under the name of the appellant \"with all the general powers and privileges incident to corporations.\"\nSections 2 and 3 read as follows:\u2014\n2. The Corporation shall have power to conduct, control and maintain an educational institution for the support, care and reformation of female penitents and for the care and education of girls generally; an hospital and dispensary for the sick; an asylum for orphan children and a home for the aged and infirm and such other persons who may desire to reside in any establishment of the Corporation according to the rules and by-laws of the Corporation.\n3. The Corporation shall have perpetual succession, a common seal and may sue and be sued; may purchase, receive or otherwise acquire lands or buildings in the Province of New Brunswick, may erect on such land acquired, as aforesaid, or any of them an educational institution, an hospital, an asylum, a home and any other necessary buildings and works and may use, convert, adapt and maintain all or any of such land, buildings and premises to and for the purposes aforesaid, and incidental thereto for the maintenance of the said institution, hospital, dispensary, asylum and home, may carry on the business of a steam and general laundry and of tailors and makers of dresses and wearing apparels of all kinds, with their usual and. necessary adjuncts and generally may enjoy real and personal estate and may mortgage, lease, convey or sell or otherwise dispose of such real and personal estate for the furtherance of the objects of the Corporation.\nThere appears to be no dispute as to the relevant facts which are set out in affidavits made by the Superior of the appellant and the Town Clerk of the respondent respectively.\nThe following paragraphs from the affidavit of the Superior are relevant:\u2014\nThat the said Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur is a Society devoted exclusively to the furtherance of the education of girls generally, and especially to the education and reformation of female penitents and the furtherance of the education and care of orphan female children.\nThat the said Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur is a religious Society whose members have taken vows of poverty and receive no wages for their services in teaching and caring for the said girls, and any revenue of the said Society has not been distributed as profits or dividends but is retained and expended exclusively for the furtherance of the purposes of the Society.\nThat the said object of furthering the general education of girls is realized by the provision of a general Christian education, to 82 boarding pupils and orphans; and that 35 female penitents are surrounded with virtuous influence and taught the habits of industry, so that they may become useful members of society and fitted to earn a living.\nThat girls are accepted in our institution regardless of their race, religion, creed or any other consideration.\nThe following paragraphs from the affidavit of the Town Clerk are also relevant:\u2014\nThat Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur, commonly known as the \"Home of the Good Shepherd\" is the owner of a large tract of land situate in the said Town of Sunny Brae, on which is constructed a large building in which it carries on a school for the education and reformation of girls, and a home for female orphan children. The said Home of the Good Shepherd carries on in the said building a very extensive public laundry and dry-cleaning business serving customers in the said Town of Sunny Brae, the City of Moncton, N.B., and generally throughout the surrounding districts. For the purpose of the said laundry and dry-cleaning business it owns and operates two motor trucks for picking up and delivering clothing and other articles to be laundered and\/or dry-cleaned for reward. It is a very keen competitor with other laundry and dry-cleaning establishments in the area served.\nThat in addition to the main building used for general purposes of the Home, and in part of which the said laundry and dry-cleaning business is carried on, the Home of the Good Shepherd is the owner of a new two family brick dwelling occupied by two male employees and for which rent is paid or included in the salary or wages paid such employees.\nThe respondent did not assess the lands or the main building of the appellant, but did assess \"the laundry and dry-cleaning equipment\" as personal property at the sum of $40,000, the trucks at $2,200 and the two-family dwelling house at $8,000, making a total assessment of $50,200. It is the legality of this assessment which is in issue, and the decision of the appeal turns upon the proper construction of section 4 of The Rates and Taxes Act, R.S.N.B. (1927) c. 190, which by section 75 of The Towns Incorporation Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 179, is made applicable to assessments for town purposes.\nCounsel for the appellant concedes that the relevant statutory provisions give the respondent authority to make the assessment in question unless the property assessed is exempt from taxation under the provisions of clauses (d) and (g) of 4(1) of The Rates and Taxes Act which read as follows:\u2014\n4. (1) The following property shall be exempt from taxation:\u2014\n(d) Every building of a religious organization used exclusively as a place of worship, or used for the religious, philanthropic or educational work of such organization, with its site and ground surrounding the same upon which no other building is erected, but this exemption shall not include real estate in respect of which rent is received by such organization; also the personal property and income of such organization, used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes;\n(g) The property of any literary or charitable society or institution.\nCounsel for the appellant, while conceding the well settled rule that clear words are necessary to give immunity from liability to taxation imposed upon the community at large since every exemption throws an additional burden on the rest of the community, argues that the appellant is a charitable society or institution and that under clause (g), quoted above, all its property is exempt from taxation. Counsel for the respondent submits that the fact of the appellant carrying on the laundry and dry-cleaning business, mentioned above, prevents it being regarded as a charitable society or institution within the meaning of clause (g). Alternatively he submits that even if the appellant would prima facie fall within the wording of clause (g) it does not do so as it is a religious organization and religious organizations being specially dealt with in clause (d) must be deemed to be excluded from clause (g).\nNeither counsel suggested that there is any statutory definition in New Brunswick of the words \"charitable society or institution.\" In Commissioner's for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel 20 at page 580, Lord Macnaghten says:\u2014\nIn construing Acts of Parliament, it is a general rule, not without authority in this House (Stephenson v. Higginson 21), that words must be taken in their legal sense unless a contrary intention appears.\n* * *\nThat according to the law of England a technical meaning is attached to the word \"charity\" and to the word \"charitable\" in such expressions as \"charitable uses\", \"charitable trusts\", Or \"charitable purposes\", cannot, I think, be denied.\nWhether the word \"charitable\" as used in clause (g) is to be construed in its legal sense or in its natural and ordinary meaning, it is, I think, beyond question that the appellant is a \"charitable society or institution\" unless its operation of the laundry and dry-cleaning plant has the effect of excluding it from such class.\nA sufficient definition of a charitable institution is to be found in the judgment of Maclean J. in Peter Birtwistle Trust v. Minister of National Revenue 22.\nA charitable institution is, I think, an organization created for the promotion of some public object of a charitable nature, and functioning as such.\nThis judgment was reversed, Kerwin J. dissenting, in [1939] S.C.R. 125, and restored sub nom Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Co. 23, but there is nothing said in any of the judgments to throw doubt on the accuracy of the definition quoted. A helpful discussion of what is a charitable institution is to be found in In re Douglas. Obert v. Barrow 24 where Kay J. at first instance (at page 479) and Lindley L.J. in the Court of Appeal (at page 487) held that the Home for Lost Dogs was a charitable institution and neither Cotton L.J. nor Bowen L.J., the other members of the Court of Appeal, said anything to suggest the contrary.\nI have reached the conclusion that notwithstanding the operation of the laundry and dry-cleaning business the appellant remains a charitable institution within clause (g). The Act of Incorporation and the material filed make it clear that the primary purposes and objects of the appellant are purely charitable. It will be observed that in s. 3 of such Act, after the enumeration of certain purposes, all charitable, it is provided that \"incidental thereto for the maintenance of the said institution, hospital, dispensary, asylum and home\" the appellant may carry on the business of a laundry. In the contemplation of the legislature as expressed in the Statute and in fact as shewn by the material filed, the operation of the laundry business, large though it be, is merely incidental to the charitable purposes of the appellant and for the maintenance thereof. This is not the case of an institution carrying on a commercial business and incidentally performing sundry charitable works or paying over its profits to be used by others for charitable purposes but rather that of a society or institution of which all the primary purposes are purely charitable which is actively engaged in carrying on charitable works and which as an incidental means of providing some of the money which is required for the prosecution of such charitable works carries on a business under statutory powers.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that the appellant is a charitable society or institution within the meaning of those words as used in clause (g) and it follows that all its property is exempt from taxation for under this clause it is the character of the owner of property rather than the use to which such property is put that determines whether it is liable to assessment.\nI have not over-looked the second argument of counsel for the respondent, that the appellant, being a religious organization, must find any exemption to which it is entitled in clause (d) and must be held to be excluded from the operation of clause (g). There is no doubt that the appellant is a religious organization but the construction contended for by counsel for the respondent would bring about the result that all the property of a society or institution whose objects were solely charitable would be exempt from taxation if such society were purely secular, or indeed if it were avowedly atheistic, but that a society with identical objects composed of members of a religious order would have only a limited exemption. It seems to me that clear and unambiguous words would be required to achieve such a result.\nI can find nothing in the wording of the Statute and I know of no rule of construction which requires us to hold that the thirteen clauses contained in section 4(1) of The Rates and Taxes Act are necessarily mutually exclusive. There is no incompatibility between religion and charity but, in law, a society may be religious without being charitable, see for example Cocks v. Manners 25, or charitable without being religious, for example the Home for Lost Dogs referred to in In re Douglas. Obert v. Barrow (supra). If, as must often happen, a society is both a religious organization and a charitable institution I see no reason why it should not be entitled to the exemption afforded by clause (g) to a charitable institution. I find nothing in the record to indicate that any of the objects or purposes of the appellant society are religious without being charitable.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the rule nisi made absolute and the assessment quashed. The appellant is entitled to its costs in this court and in the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nRand J.:\u2014The society or institution appealing to this Court is a body corporate by the name \"Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur.\" The incorporation was by special act of the legislature of New Brunswick in 1945. The objects are, to conduct, control and maintain an educational institution for support, care, and reformation of female penitents and for the care and education of girls generally; a hospital and dispensary for the sick; an asylum for orphan children and a home for the aged and infirm and such other persons as may desire to reside in an establishment of the society; and as incidental to these purposes and for the maintenance of the institution, power was given to carry on the businesses of a steam and general laundry and of tailors and makers of dresses and wearing apparel of all kinds, with their usual adjuncts.\nThe corporation has its seat near the city of Monoton and as part of its activities it conducts a general laundry business. Those engaged in the laundry include inmates as well as outside employees, and the business is in public competition with other laundries. Under The Rates and Taxes Act of the Province, it has been assessed on the building with its land occupied by two drivers of laundry trucks and the personal property, largely machinery, including the trucks, used in the business, in the sum of $52,200.\nExemption from taxation is claimed under paragraphs (d) and (g) of section 4 of the statute which are as follows:\n(d) Every building of a religious organization used exclusively as a place of worship, or used for the religious, philanthropic or educational work of such organization, with its site and ground surrounding the same upon which no other building is erected, but this exemption shall not include real estate in respect of which rent is received by such organization; also the personal property and income of such organization, used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes;\"\n(g) The property of any literary or charitable society or institution;\nIn the petition for certiorari and in the affidavit of Antoinette des Coteaux, the Superior, the organization is described as a religious society whose members have taken vows of poverty and receive no wages for their services in teaching and caring for the girls, and it is stated that the income is expended exclusively for the furtherance of the purposes of the society. About 60 per cent of those attending the general education classes pay a tuition fee of $20 a month, but the fee is said not to be a condition of admission to or continuance in the institution. Of the female penitents in what is known as the \"School of Protection\" only four pay the fee and eighteen are accommodated free, except for whatever revenue may be derived from their labour.\nThe question in controversy involves the characterization given to the corporation and its activities. A charity or charitable society is, I should say, one whose purposes are those described in the preamble to the statute 43 Eliz. c. 4 or purposes analogous to them. They can be classified generally, as for the advancement of religion, for the relief of poverty, for the promotion of education, and for other purposes bearing a public interest: and the attributes attaching to all are their voluntariness and, directly or indirectly, their reflex on public welfare.\nA religious society may or may not be charitable. In In re White 26, it was held that a bequest \"to a religious society\", without more, meant, prima facie, for religious purposes and so charitable. In Cocks v. Manners 27, a religious institution consisting of a voluntary association of women whose purpose was \"the working out of their own salvation by religious exercises and self-denial\" was held not to be charitable. In Townsend v. Cams 28, in which a legacy was left on trust for the benefit of societies, subscriptions or purposes \"having regard to the glory of God, in the spiritual welfare of his creatures\", for which a scheme had to be devised, was construed by Wigram V-C. to be a gift for religious purposes and to be restricted to such purposes. In the course of dealing with the argument that ways of expending the property might be suggested which might be conducive to spiritual welfare, but which separately taken would not in themselves be charitable, he observed:\u2014\nIt appears to me sufficient to say that if, as I think the case is, the end proposed by the testatrix is charitable, no expenditure can be lawful which is not directly conducive to that end; and the end itself cannot lose its charitable character only because parts of the machinery admissible for its accomplishment are not in themselves abstractedly considered charitable. Writing, for example, is not grammar; but if grammar cannot be so well learned without first learning to write, that may be taught in a pure grammar school, as a step to the learning which is its proper object. Lindley L.J. in In re White, supra, paraphrases this language thus:\u2014\nHaving come to the conclusion that the object of the testator was charitable because it was religious, he says that no mode of carrying out his intention could be proper if that mode was not itself charitable.\nThis artificial signification, unless the context modifies it; is to be attributed to either \"charitable\" or \"charity\" when it appears in a statute: Commissioners v. Pemsel 29; and the former as used in paragraph (g) is to be so interpreted.\nAs long ago as 1675, in the case of Webb v. Batchelet 30, specifically holding them chargeable to repairs of highways, the Court declared parsons chargeable with all public duties; and that this is the settled view appears from Phillimore's Ecclesiastical Law, 2nd Ed., Vol. I, p. 477. Taxes, then, are the rule against all, and he who claims an exemption must show that he comes within the language delineating it. It must be shown, as Duff J., later Chief Justice, said, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Montreal v. College of Sainte Marie 31, \"that the privilege invoked has unquestionably been created.\"\nGeneral tax legislation in New Brunswick began at the inception of the province. C. 42 of the consolidated statutes of 1836, providing for county rates, was enacted in 1786 and directs the assessors to \"apportion the quota of the said sum or sums of money so to be levied upon the respective towns or parishes, to be paid by the several and respective inhabitants of the said towns or parishes as they in their discretion shall think just and reasonable.\" In 1875, in a re-cast of the Rates Act of 1853, exemptions pertinent to the question before us first appeared and they were in the form of paragraph (g). Previous to this, legislation applying to Saint John and Fredericton had provided for Church and other privileges but they were not uniform. Clause (d), on the other hand, was first enacted in 1924.\nMr. Carvell argues that the use of the property is within clause (d) by reason of the fact that the entire net income from the business is to be applied to purposes mentioned in the paragraph. But the uses contemplated are immediate and actual \"religious, philanthropic or educational\" activities, not those of ordinary business, whatever the ultimate destination of its revenues. Lands yielding rents have long been used as a form of charitable endowment, but they are excluded from the exemption, which implies, a fortiori, that business use is excluded.\nAlthough the benefit to the truck drivers in the occupation of the two houses has not been reduced to a specific sum, it represents a business remuneration: and whether looked upon in the aspect of rent or the nature of the use, it is excluded from the paragraph.\nThe language of use for the personal property is at least as restrictive as that for the lands; if the word \"exclusively\" in the first clause is not to be carried forward to the use of all buildings and lands, it is more so ; and the use of personal property for business purposes would likewise be excluded. The separate treatment of personal property and income from that of lands results from the fact that several features of the former had to be specially dealt with, and to have combined the language dealing with both of them would have produced an involved and cumbersome locution.\nHe then appeals to paragraph (g). The word \"charitable\" here connotes solely purposes, works and modes of action of the character described: a society that could, for instance, for all of its objects, receive charitable bequests with their peculiar privileges such as perpetual endowment. The illustration by Wigram V-C. quoted indicates that the carrying on of a business as part of a society's functions would rule it out of that category. Charity is essentially voluntary good works and voluntary donations the accepted means of obtaining the material resources necessary to them, both of which are incompatible with the means here.\nIf paragraph (g) is to be taken to include all societies and institutions having charity as the ultimate destination of their funds by whatever means raised, then clearly a religious society with solely charitable objects and powers would lie within it. At the same time it would be embraced within paragraph (d) since \"religious, philanthropic and educational\" works include all matters of charity and, as well, some matters of benevolence beyond them. For such an organization, then, what could have been the purpose of introducing paragraph (d)? I should find it difficult to imagine any reasonable or practical purpose except to codify and clarify the position of religious societies, and to enlarge the scope of the exempting uses of their property. But whether to enlarge or restrain, the entire class is clearly intended to be withdrawn from (g).\nIf this is not so, a religious society with mixed charitable and business objects, or a non-religious organization, both having ultimate charitable purposes, would remain exempt as to all its property under (g), which would mean virtually that the further a society was from a true charity, the broader its exemption. Such an anomaly could not be attributed to the intention of the legislature. What (g) envisages are charitable and literary societies and institutions strictly so-called, with neither objects nor powers nor works outside of those descriptions. That the Companies Act should provide as it does in s. 17(2) (\u0192) that\nThe Company shall not carry on any business or trade for the profit of its members,\nthe last six words of which were added in 1944, adds nothing to the argument: whatever its effect may be, it is irrelevant to the meaning of the clause I am considering.\nA similar exemption of \"the property of a literary or scientific institution\", in the Income Tax Act of 1842, language which seems to be the prototype of that of clause (g) here, was dealt with in Manchester v. McAdam 32, by the Court of Appeal and, on appeal, by the House of Lords 33. The city of Manchester had set aside certain buildings for a public library administered by a special Board; its purposes were unquestionably literary, and exemption was claimed for it as a \"literary institution\". The only doubt arose from the fact that it was maintained by rates. The Court of Appeal, Lindley and Rigby L.JJ., with Brett L.J. dissenting, held that it was not within the exemption because of its support by taxes, that what the statute designed was to encourage gifts of land to such institutions, supported in their activities likewise by other gifts or subscriptions, all for the ultimate benefit to the public. The House of Lords took another view; but Lord Halsbury L.C., dissenting, speaks of the rate \"distinguishing it from the voluntary character of a literary and scientific institution such as existed in 1842\". In the opinion of the majority, an institution was to be conceived as an objective establishment for the purpose designated, which the library was, and its support by taxes was not a disqualifying factor. But the fact of such a difference of opinion hinging on such an element satisfies me that had the corporation, for instance, carried on a general printing business as auxiliary to its library administration, though with the net revenue devoted exclusively to the purposes of the library, its exemption could not have been seriously argued. The same principle was applied in In re Badger, 34 in which an incorporated body under the Literary and Scientific Institution Act, was held incapable of borrowing money for the purposes of a recreation adjunct.\nWhat is here, then, is not a \"charitable society or institution\"; it is a society of mixed objects and works or activities, some of which are charitable and some not; and it is not such a society as the legislature had in mind when, in 1875, it first decided to provide so comprehensive an exemption as that of all the property of such owners.\nWe have today many huge foundations yielding revenues applied solely to charitable purposes; they may consist, as in one case, of a newspaper business ; even if these foundations themselves carried on their charitable ministrations, to characterize them as charitable institutions merely because of the ultimate destination of the net revenues, would be to distort the meaning of familiar language; and to make that ultimate application the sole test of their charitable quality would introduce into the law conceptions that might have disruptive implications upon basic principles not only of taxation but of economic and constitutional relations generally. If that is to be done, it must be by the legislature. Concessions to taxation of income or property, as in the Income Tax Act of Great Britain, may expressly provide for meeting the modern development of mixed charitable and business objects as we have them here: but that was remote from what the legislature had in mind in 1875. As the works and activities of the society, then, are not solely of a charitable nature, it is not within paragraph (g); but whether there originally or not, as a religious society, it must find exemption for its property in paragraph (d) which, for the reasons given, it cannot do. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The error which the appellant alleges to exist in the decision of the Appellate Division is thus set out in its factum:\n(a) The finding that rent is received for the brick dwelling house.\n(b) The finding that the laundry and drycleaning equipment, and property used in conjunction therewith, is not used exclusively for the religious, philanthropic or educational work of the Society and is therefore not exempt from taxation.\n(c) The ruling that exemption from taxation cannot be claimed in respect of the property of Les Dames Religieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur under section 4(1) (g) of the Rates and Taxes Act, and that the said property is not exempt from taxation thereunder.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with the first contention.\nThe appellant's second contention, based on the provisions of s. 4 (1) (d) of the relevant statute, is that it is authorized by its incorporating statute to carry on the laundry and dry-cleaning business as \"incidental\" to its philanthropic and educational purposes, and therefore, as any profits received by the appellant from the carrying on of the business are devoted to its charitable purposes, the property used in carrying on such business is as much used for its philanthropic and educational purposes as its other property.\nThe appellant further contends that even if it fails in its second contention on the basis of use, it may have resort for exemption to the provisions of para. (g) as a \"charitable society or institution,\" in which case mere ownership is sufficient.\nThe relevant portions of the statute are as follows:\n4. (1) The following property shall be exempt from taxation:\n(d) Every building of a religious organization used exclusively as a place of worship, or used for the religious, philanthropic or educational work of such organization, with its site and ground surrounding the same upon which no other building is erected, but this exemption shall not include real estate in respect of which rent is received by such organization; also the personal property and income of such organization, used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes;\n(g) The property of any literary or charitable society or institution.\nWith the contention that the use of the property real and personal here in question is brought within the terms of para. (d), I find it impossible to agree. That the business is being carried on as \"incidental\" to the charitable work of the appellant does not alter the fact that the use of the property is for business purposes, and it is immaterial that the appellant, after receipt of the profits from the business, devotes such profits to the support of its actual charitable work.\nComan v. Governors of the Rotunda Hospital 35, is in point. The hospital, unquestionably a charity in the strict sense, had certain rooms not used by it for hospital purposes but let out by it for hire for entertainments, concerts and cinema shows. By 5 and 6 Vict. c. 35, s. 60, duties under Schedule \"A\" of the statute were assessable upon the annual value of premises, but by s. 61 an exception from such duties was provided in the case of \"any hospital * * * in respect of the public buildings, offices and premises belonging to such hospital\" and upon \"the rents and profits of lands, tenements, hereditaments and heritages belonging to such hospital * * * so far as the same are applied to charitable purposes.\" This statute was extended to Ireland by 16 and 17 Vict. c. 34, s. 3.\nBy the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, s. 2, the valuing authority was directed \"to distinguish all hereditaments and tenements, or portions of the same * * * used for charitable purposes * * * and all such hereditaments or tenements, or portions of the same, so distinguished, shall, so long as they continue to be * * * used for the purposes aforesaid, be deemed exempt from all assessment.\" Until 1915 the rooms in question had been scheduled as exempt in the Valuation List, and accordingly were not assessed for rating or Schedule \"A\" purposes. The Crown now sought to tax the profits arising from the hiring out of the rooms under Schedule \"D\", as being profits from a trade.\nOn behalf of the hospital it was contended that all profits derived from the lettings of the rooms were applied to the general support of the hospital and that the moneys so received were rents and profits of tenements belonging to a hospital within s. 61, and that these moneys, so far as they were applied to charitable purposes, were exempt. They contended that they were a single statutory corporation constituting an indivisible charitable trust, and that they were not carrying on a trade or anything in the nature of a trade.\nIt is clear that, apart from the question as to carrying on a trade, the use of the premises by the respondents for purely hospital purposes would have entitled them to exemption from tax in respect of the annual value of the premises, but it was held that they were carrying on a trade and in so doing went beyond the bounds of the exemption to which they were entitled under Schedule \"A\". In the course of his judgment, the Earl of Birkenhead L.C. said at p. 14:\nWhen the facts set out in the case stated and the documents annexed to it are considered as a whole, it becomes plain that the respondents, with the laudable object of raising an income for the support of their charitable activities, have engaged in what can only be described as a business or a concern in the nature of a business, and thereby have earned annual profits which are outside the scope of Schedule A.\nIn that case and in later cases in the House of Lords, the decision of the Court of Session in Religious Tract and Book Society v. Forbes 36, was approved.\nIn the last mentioned case, the object of the plaintiff society, according to its constitution, was \"by the circulation of religious tracts and books to diffuse a pure and religious literature among all classes of the community.\" The constitution went on to provide that \"this object shall be carried out by the establishment of central and branch depositories and of auxiliary societies and by means of colportage and other agencies.\" The society operated two \"depositories\" or book stores, one at Edinburgh and the other at Belfast, and in addition, carried on the colportage agencies. The sales of all three were of the same goods at the same prices, there being only one stock out of which all its salesmen were supplied. The profits made by the stores were applied to the carrying on of the colportage, a purely charitable activity, which could not be carried on by itself at a profit but required the further aid of public subscriptions. The Lord President, later Lord Rubersten, at p. 418 put the matter thus:\n* * * it may be conceded to the Appellants that the object of their Society is not that of making profit, but the diffusion of religious literature among all classes of the community. But incidental to that large and beneficial purpose they engage in trade * * * It appears that the colportage agency could not be carried on at a profit as a commercial undertaking,, and is persevered in merely because the Society find that by appealing to the religious public they are able to obtain subscriptions which enable them to fill up the deficit. When we turn to the methods of the colportage, it appears that they are not commercial methods, that, is to say, that the business carried on is not purely that of pushing the sale of their goods, but that on the contrary the duty of the salesman is to dwell over the purchase and make it the occasion of administering religious advice and counsel. Now, under these conditions it seems to me impossible to hold that this is a business, trade, or adventure, which is unfortunately resulting in loss. It is really a charitable mission in which the sale of the Scriptures is made the occasion for doing something more than merely effect the sale of books. And accordingly, while I completely assent to the view that the establishment and conduct of the shops and the establishment and conduct of the colportage all rest upon the same ultimate motive, yet at the same time the two operations seem to be essentially distinguished. The shops are simply book-seller's shops\u2014the other is a combination of the sale of books with a missionary enterprise * * *\nAt p. 419 Lord Adam said:\nNow, I agree with your Lordship that if a party takes to selling books it does not matter to the Crown what his object is in doing so, whether it is to put profit into his own pocket, or, having made profit, to expend that in charity or donation.\nIn my opinion, it is too clear for argument that the \"use\" referred to in para. (d) of the statute in the case at bar, is the actual use to which the property is put, and not the object to which the profits from the business which may be carried on, on the property, after their receipt by the proprietor of the business, may be devoted. Accordingly, I think the judgment below is right in holding that the appellant in respect of the real and personal property here in question does not come within the exempting provisions of para. (d).\nThe further contention of the appellant that, although as a \"religious organization\" it is not entitled to exemption under para. (d), it may nonetheless claim exemption as a \"charitable society or institution\" under para. (g), requires examination. If sound, it would involve anomalous consequences. For example, a religious organization, which is a charity in the strict sense, owning productive real property which it does not use but lets to tenants, while denied exemption therefor by the express terms of para. (d), would nevertheless, on the basis of this argument, be entitled to exemption in respect of the very same property under para. (g). Again, real or personal property, lying idle and not used, would be taxable on the basis of para. (d) but exempt under para. (g).\nAll religious organizations are not, of course, charitable organizations; vide Cocks v. Manners 37. The property of such organizations, therefore, to be entitled to exemption, would have to be brought within clause (d). I have no doubt that the great bulk of the religious organizations in the Province of New Brunswick at the time of the enactment for the first time of para. (d) in 1924, were charitable institutions within the strict sense of those words. It would seem to be a rather remarkable intention to be attributed to the legislature in the enactment of clause (d) that the great majority of religious organizations should be entitled to claim exemption for their real and personal property under the provisions of the new legislation if the use of such property brought it therein, and at the same time that their previously existing exemption to which they were already entitled on the mere basis of ownership should also be preserved to them. In my opinion, the construction of a statute which produces such anomalies is contrary to well settled canons of construction.\nA statute is to be construed, if at all possible, \"so that there may be no repugnancy or inconsistency between its portions or members;\" City of Victoria v. Bishop of Vancouver Island 38, per Lord Atkinson, at p. 388. The principle applicable is, in my opinion, that stated at p. 176 of the 9th Edition of Maxwell, as follows:\nWhere a general intention is expressed, and also a particular intention which is incompatible with the general one, the particular intention is considered an exception to the general one. Among the authorities referred to in the judgment of Sir George Jessel M.R. in Taylor v. Oldham 39. At p. 410 the learned Master of the Rolls said:\n* * * but I think in all these Acts of Parliament, the first thing you have to consider is, that where you have general provisions, whether contained in the same Act or in another Act of Parliament, and where you have special provisions as to a particular property in the ownership of one individual, you must read the special provisions as excepted out of the general.\nThe statute there under consideration was a private statute, but there is no difference in the application of the principle in the case of a public Act. Clause (g) of the section here in question is a general provision including all charitable institutions, and, in order to make the statute consistent with itself, clause (d) is to be regarded as an exception out of (g). The fact that (d) includes religious organizations not charitable, does not affect the principle to be applied.\nIn C.N.R. v. Capreol 40, the statute under construction was the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, by s. 5 of which all real property in Ontario was made liable to taxation \"subject to the following exemptions:\n2. Every place of worship and land used in connection therewith and every churchyard, cemetery or burying ground.\n3. The buildings and grounds of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of a university, high school, public or separate school, whether vested in a trustee or otherwise, so long as such buildings and grounds are actually used and occupied by such institution, but not if otherwise occupied,\n4. The buildings and grounds of, and attached to, or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of a seminary of learning maintained for philanthropic, religious, or educational purposes, the whole profits from which are devoted or applied to such purposes only, but such grounds and buildings shall be exempt only while actually used and occupied by such seminary.\n5. Every city or town hall, and every court house, gaol, lock-up and public hospital receiving aid under The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act, with the land attached thereto but not land of a public hospital when occupied by any person as tenant or lessee.\n9. Every industrial farm, house of industry, house of refuge, orphan asylum, and every boys' or girls' or infants' home or other charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain, and every house belonging to a company for the reformation of offenders, and the land belonging to or connected with the same; but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee. 10. The property of any children's aid society incorporated under the Children's Protection Act of Ontario, whether held in the name of the society or in the name of a trustee or otherwise, if used exclusively for the purposes of and in connection with the society.\n12. The property of every public library and other public institution, literary or scientific, and of every agricultural or horticultural society or association, to the extent of the actual occupation of such property for the purposes of the institution or society.\n13. The land of every company formed for the erection of exhibition buildings to the extent to which the council of the municipality in which such land is situate consents that it shall be exempt.\nThe question for decision was as to whether or not certain land owned by the railway and a building thereon containing numerous bedrooms, a reading room and other rooms and facilities for lodgings, entertainment and recreation, all operated by the Young Men's Christian Association under the terms of an agreement with the railway calling for payment of a nominal rent to the latter, was exempt under sub-s. 9 above. This was decided adversely to the appellant. In the course of delivering the judgment of the court, Anglin C.J.C. said at p. 502:\nThe claim of the appellant was that the Railway Y.M.C.A. at Capreol is\n\"a charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain,\"\nand that it is, therefore, entitled to the exemption claimed\nBut it seems obvious that every charitable institution so conducted does not fall within s.s. 9 of s. 5. Special exemptions of undertakings of a charitable nature conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purposes of profit and gain are to be found in s.s. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 and 13. It seems reasonably certain, therefore, that the words\n\"charitable institutions conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain,\"\nare not used in ss. 9 in their most comprehensive sense.\nThe learned Chief Justice went on to hold that the sense in which the words, \"charitable institutions conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain,\" were used in clause 9, was ejusdem generis with the other institutions mentioned in that clause, but it was \"obvious\" to the court that the general category of charitable institution mentioned in clause 9 did not include the particular charitable institutions described in the other sub-sections. The particular was to be considered as excepted out of the general provision. There is an additional reason, however, why, in my opinion, the appellant, as a religious organization, must find its exemption, if any, in the terms of para. (d) exclusively.\nAs already pointed out, the word \"charitable,\" as used in para. (g), is not used in its popular but in its technical sense; Chesterman v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation 41, 128; Adamson v. Melbourne 42. A religious society may or may not be a charitable society in this sense, and upon any question arising, the court will inquire into the purposes of the society.\nIn Morice V. Bishop of Durham 43, Sir William Grant M.R. formulated the test as follows at p. 406:\nThe question is, not, whether he (the testator) may not apply it upon purposes strictly charitable, but whether he is bound so to apply it? I am not aware of any case, in which the bequest has been held charitable, where the testator has not either used that word, to denote his general purpose, or specified some particular purpose, which this Court had determined to be charitable in its nature.\nIn the case at bar, the objects of the appellant are to conduct an educational institution for the support, care and reformation of female penitents, and for the care and education of girls generally; an hospital and dispensary for the sick; an asylum for orphan children, and a home for the aged and infirm and such other persons who may desire to reside in an establishment of the corporation according to its rules and by-laws; and \"incidental\" thereto, but nonetheless for the \"maintenance of the said institution\" it is given the power to carry on \"the business of a steam and general laundry, and of tailors and makers of dresses and wearing apparels of all kinds with their usual and necessary adjuncts.\" According to the affidavit of the Town Clerk and Treasurer of the relator, the appellant does carry on in the building here in question\na very extensive public laundry and drycleaning business serving customers in the said Town of Sunny Brae, the City of Moncton, New Brunswick, and generally throughout the surrounding districts. For the purpose of the said laundry and drycleaning business it owns and operates two motor trucks for picking up and delivering clothing and other articles to be laundered and\/or drycleaned for reward. It is a very keen competitor with other laundry and drycleaning establishments in the area served. In Brighton College v. Marriott 44, Lord Blanesburgh said at p. 204:\nWhether in any particular case activities which may properly be described as charitable have become trading or commercial must always be a question of fact\u2014one important consideration being whether these activities are being conducted with commercial considerations in view and on commercial principles: see Religious Tract and Book Society of Scotland v. Forbes 45.\nThere can be no doubt of the commercial nature of the appellant's laundry and drycleaning business, and a trust for the benefit of the appellant could not meet the test laid down by Sir William Grant.\nIn Dunne v. Byrne 46, in which a residuary bequest \"to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane and his successors to be used and expended wholly or in part as such Archbishop may judge most conducive to the good of religion in this diocese,\" was held not to be a good charitable bequest but void, Lord Macnaghten, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, pointed out at p. 410 that it could hardly be disputed that a thing may be \"conducive\" and in particular circumstances \"most conducive\" to the good of religion in a particular diocese or in a particular district without being charitable in the sense which the court attaches to the word, and indeed without being in itself in any sense religious. He went on to say:\nIn the present case the learned Chief Justice suggests by way of example several modes in which the fund now in question might be employed so as to be conducive to the good of religion though the mode of application in itself might have nothing of a religious character about it.\nWhat is thus referred to by Lord Macnaghten is to be found in the judgment of Griffith C.J. in 11 Commonwealth Law Reports, 637 at 645, as follows:\nAgain, it seems to me that purposes may reasonably be called conducive to the good of religion although they have no such direct tendency. For instance, it might well be said that * * * the establishment of a newspaper conducted on religious or high moral principles * * * would be purposes conducive to the good of religion. Certainly the Archbishop might reasonably think so. I do not at present see my way to deny such a proposition. But I do not think that either purpose would be a charitable purpose. In the case of the appellant, therefore, the carrying on of the laundry business is not a charitable purpose, and the appellant, regarded as an entirety, could not constitute the object of a valid charitable trust, and cannot, therefore, be said to be a charitable corporation.\nEven a church, regarded as an entirety, inclusive of all its purposes, parochial as well as ecclesiastical, cannot constitute the object of a valid charitable trust; Farley v. Westminster Bank 47; In re Jackson 48. Where the testator does not indicate any larger purpose, a trust for the benefit of a church will be saved from invalidity by the presumption of law that the benefit is intended for ecclesiastical purposes only; In re White 49.\nTo apply the same presumption in the case of a trust for the benefit of a corporation such as the appellant would save a trust for its benefit from invalidity, but the presumption has no place under the taxing statute here in question, under which the appellant is to be taken as an entirety, and when so regarded, is not a charitable corporation.\nThe decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood in Lechmere v. Curtler 50, casts an interesting side-light upon the matter, which leads to the same result. In that case the testator had bequeathed a sum of money to the treasurer, for the time being, of an asylum thereafter to be instituted \"for the humane and charitable purposes of that institution.\" An asylum was afterwards built under the compulsory provisions of an Act of Parliament. It was supported by compulsory rates, and was used entirely for the maintenance of pauper lunatics. At p. 648 the learned Vice-Chancellor said:\nNobody questions that the maintenance of lunatics is humane and charitable, and a bequest of this nature might be useful in inducing the Justices to build an asylum. No doubt the legislature had humane and charitable purposes in view, but the building of this asylum was simply compulsory on the Justices. If I gave this \u00a31,000 to this asylum, I should be merely relieving the rates to that extent, and I cannot say that this would be a humane and charitable application of the legacy within the meaning of the testator's will. In the case at bar, a trust for the benefit of the appellant corporation simpliciter, which it would be free to use, say, for the expansion of the laundry with the object of increasing profits, or to replace worn-out equipment, or to tide it over unprofitable periods, could not be said to be, in any sense, a charitable application of the proceeds of the trust. Accordingly, the appellant cannot be regarded as a \"charitable society or institution\" within the purview of the statute here in question.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014That the appellant, incorporated by an act of the Legislature of New Brunswick in 1945 (S. of N.B. 1945, c. 94), is a religious organization and, therefore, entitled to the exemptions from taxation within the meaning of s. 4(1) (d) of The Rates and Taxes Act (R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 190), is not disputed. The appellant, however, contests the imposition by the respondent of taxes upon the brick duplex dwelling, occupied by two of its laundry employees, and its personal property consisting of the laundry equipment and two trucks, by virtue of the exceptions contained in this subpara. (d). s. 4(1) (d) reads as follows:\n4. (1) The following property shall be exempt from taxation:\n(d) Every building of a religious organization used exclusively as a place of worship, or used for the religious, philanthropic or educational work of such organization, with its site and ground surrounding the same upon which no other building is erected, but this exemption shall not include real estate in respect of which rent is received by such organization; also the personal property and income of such organization, used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes;\nThe Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Mr. Justice Hughes dissenting, held that the respondent was right in taxing the brick duplex dwelling, as well as the personal property in the laundry and the two trucks.\nThe record discloses no controversy as to the facts. It sets out that the appellant\nis the owner of a large tract of land situate in the said Town of Sunny Brae, on which is constructed a large building in which it carries on a school for the education and reformation of girls, and a home for female orphan children. The said Home of the Good Shepherd carries on in the said building a very extensive public laundry and drycleaning business serving customers in the said Town of Sunny Brae, the City of Moncton, N.B., and generally throughout the surrounding districts. For the purpose of the said laundry and drycleaning business it owns and operates two motor trucks for picking up and delivering clothing and other articles to be laundered and\/or drycleaned for reward. It is a very keen competitor with other laundry and drycleaning establishments in the area served.\n3. That in addition to the main building used for general purposes of the Home, and in part of which the said laundry and drycleaning business is carried on, the Home of the Good Shepherd is the owner of a new two family brick dwelling occupied by two male employees and for which rent is paid or included in the salary or wages paid such employees.\nNo further particulars are given as to the wages of the two employees, but the hearing of this appeal proceeded upon the basis that they were hired and their wages paid partly in cash and partly in the permission of each to occupy exclusively one half of the brick duplex. In these circumstances, that the appellant was paid or received remuneration in the form of services for this brick duplex must be conceded. The essential question is whether this remuneration is included in the word \"rent\" as used in the exception in s. 4(1) (d). The word is not defined in The Rates and Taxes Act. In Halsbury's Laws of England it is stated:\nRent\u2014that is, rent-service\u2014is the recompense paid by the lessee to the lessor for the exclusive possession of corporeal hereditaments. It need not consist of the payment of money. It may consist in the render of chattels, or the performance of services. 20 Hals., 2nd Ed., p. 158, para. 170.\nSee Woodfall's Law of Landlord & Tenant, 24th Ed., 303; Williams on Canadian Landlord & Tenant, 2nd Ed., 159.\nThe word \"rent\" is itself a word of very wide import, not always correctly employed in ordinary current user, particularly in taxing provisions. Lord Wright in Earl Fitzwilliam's Collieries Company v. Phillips, [1943] A.C. 570 at 581.\nIn Vyvyan v. Arthur 51, Thomas Vyvyan, as owner in fee, leased certain premises requiring the payment of certain money \"and also doing suit to the mill of the said Thomas, his heirs and assigns, called Tregamere mill, by grinding all such corn there as should grow in or upon the close thereby demised during the term.\" It was held that the covenant requiring the grinding of the corn was \"in the nature of a rent,\" Bayley J. stating at p. 414:\nThe lease contains a reddendum, and whatever services or suits are thereby reserved partake of the character of rent. The language adopted by the Legislature in subpara. (d) \"this exemption shall not include real estate in respect of which rent is received by such organization\" does not suggest that it was legislating with reference to rent in the strict sense. It is not the reservation of rent or any right to distrain therefor, which latter Lord Halsbury describes as \"the mark of rent\" (20 Hals., 2nd Ed., p. 158, para. 170), or, indeed, any of the attributes connected with the word when used in the strict sense. On the contrary, it rather appears that the Legislature adopted the word in the broader sense, as defined in Woodfall's Law of Landlord and Tenant, 24th Ed., p. 303: \"Rent is a retribution or compensation for the lands demised.\" It is not, however, necessary to determine the exact meaning, more than to indicate that the language ought not to be construed in the restricted sense but that it is sufficiently comprehensive to include that which was received by the appellant organization as remuneration for the brick duplex dwelling.\nIn the absence of facts to the contrary, I think we should assume, because of the returns that must be made in respect of workment's compensation and unemployment insurance, that the total wages were known and, therefore, ascertained. In reality the employees paid for the use of these premises an amount \"in the nature of a rent\" or \"in the character of rent.\" In these circumstances it would appear that the word \"rent,\" as used in s. 4(1) (d), is sufficiently wide to cover this particular payment. See also Tucker v. Morse 52; Edney v. Benham 53.\nThe personal property taxed is used in the conduct of the laundry and dry-cleaning business. The fact that the net income from this business is applied for the purposes of the appellant's religious organization does not detract from the fact that the equipment here taxed is used in the conduct of a business which serves not only the appellant's organization, but the public generally. It, therefore, cannot be said that this personal property is \"used exclusively for religious, philanthropic or educational purposes\" within the meaning of subpara. (d) and it is, therefore, subject to be taxed by the respondent. The appellant, however, claims that even if, under subpara. (d), the foregoing property is taxable, it is a charitable institution within the meaning of subpara. (g) and, therefore, that its entire property is exempt. Subpara. (g) reads as follows:\n(g) The property of any literary or charitable society or institution;\nAssuming, therefore, as the appellant contends, that it is both a religious organization and a charitable institution, the pertinent issue is, having regard to the provisions of the statute, may it be included and, therefore, entitled to have all of its property exempted under the provisions of subpara. (g)?\nWhile the provision in subpara. (g) has been included in The Rates and Taxes Act since 1850 (S. of N.B. 1850, 13 Vict., c. 30, s. II, art. 17, subpara. (d) was not included until the act was consolidated and amended in 1924 (S. of N.B. 1924, 14 Geo. V, c. 3). The language adopted in the enactment of subpara. (d) read by itself discloses the Legislature intended that all religious organizations should be subject to the provisions of that subpara. Moreover, it would appear that when subparas. (d) and (g) are construed together according to the accepted rules of construction, which again the Legislature would intend, the result is that all religious organizations are subject only to the provisions of subpara. (d). Subpara. (d) is particular in that it applies only to religious organizations, while subpara. (g) is more general in character and includes all literary and charitable societies and institutions, which would include the majority of religious organizations as well as all other types of literary and charitable societies and institutions. It is a case, therefore, where the rule, as stated by Sir John Romilly, should be applied:\nThe general rules which are applicable to particular and general enactments in statutes are very clear, the only difficulty is in their application. The rule is, that wherever there is a particular enactment and a general enactment in the same statute, and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply. Pretty v. Solly, 53 E.R. 1032 at 1034.\nIn another case Sir John Romilly gives this example:\nFor instance, if there is an authority in an act of parliament to a corporation to sell a particular piece of land, and there is then a general clause at the end that nothing in this act contained shall authorize the corporation to sell any land, that would not control the particular enactment, but the particular enactment would take effect notwithstanding it was not clearly expressed and distinct, and the insertion of the exception in the general clause would be supplied. De Winton v. The Mayor, etc. of Brecon, (1859) 28 Law J. Rep. (N.S.) Chanc. 600 at 604.\nIt would, therefore, follow that subpara. (d), being particular, should apply to all religious organizations, charitable and non-charitable, and that subpara. (g), being general, should apply to all other charitable societies and institutions.\nThe same construction, in the circumstances of this case, finds support in the rule stated by Lord Macnaghten when, after pointing out that where there is no preamble to the statute there are \"only two cases in which it is permissible to depart from the ordinary and natural sense of the words of an enactment,\" goes on to state, as one of these exceptions,\nthat there is some other clause in the body of the Act inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the enactment in question construed in the ordinary sense of the language in which it is expressed. Vacher & Sons, Limited v. London Society of Compositors, 1913 A.C. 107 at 118.\nSee also Becke v. Smith 54; The Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. The King 55.\nThat there is such an inconsistency or repugnancy between these subparas. (d), and (g) becomes clear when it is appreciated that religious organizations are, for the most part, charitable in character. All religious organizations, charitable and non-charitable, are included in subpara. (d) and are exempt from taxation except as provided in the two exceptions therein specified. If, however, those religious organizations which are charitable come also within subpara. (g), it follows they are not, under that subpara., subject to the exemptions in subpara. (d). If, therefore, the statute be so construed as to include these under subpara. (g), the purpose and intent of subpara. (d) is largely destroyed and the intention of the legislature, as expressed in subpara. (d), substantially defeated. The magnitude and importance of this inconsistency or repugnancy becomes more apaprent when it is appreciated that organizations for religious purposes are, for the most part, charitable. Those which are charitable and non-charitable are discussed by Sir John Wickens, V.C.:\nA voluntary association of women for the purpose of working out their own salvation by religious exercises and self-denial seems to me to have none of the requisites of a charitable institution, whether the word \"charitable\" is used in its popular sense or in its legal sense. It is said, in some of the cases, that religious purposes are charitable, but that can only be true as to religious services tending directly or indirectly towards the instruction or the edification of the public; an annuity to an individual, so long as he spent his time in retirement and constant devotion, would not be charitable, nor would a gift to ten persons, so long as they lived together in retirement and performed acts of devotion, be charitable.\" Cocks v. Manners, 1871 L.R. 1 Eq. 674 at 585.\nLord Lindley describes a religious society non-charitable in character\nA society for the promotion of private prayer and devotion by its own members, and which has no wider scope, no public element, no purposes of general utility. In re White, (1893) 2 Ch. 41 at 51.\nand, as stated by Lord Wrenbury,\nReligious purposes are charitable only if they tend directly or indirectly towards the instruction or the edification of the public. Chesterman v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation, 1926 A.C. 128 at 131.\nA statutory provision that appears so complete and accurate to accomplish the purpose intended, when enacted, subsequently studied in the light of particular facts often appears to be quite different. It then becomes a problem of construction. The problem here presented has occurred so often that the foregoing rules have been dictated by experience as of assistance in determining, in such circumstances, the intention of parliaments and legislatures. Their application in this instance not only avoids the inconsistency or repugnancy already discussed, but also avoids a construction which limits and restricts the comprehensive and inclusive language of subpara. (d) in a manner that it cannot be said the Legislature ever intended.\nIt would, therefore, appear that the intention of the Legislature is given effect to by construing subparas. (d) and (g) in such a manner that religious organizations, though also charitable, as the appellant's is, are included only under subpara. (d).\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Leger & Carvell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Creaghan & Creaghan.\n1 (1951) 28 M.P.R. 380; 3 D.L.R. 394.\n2 [1925] 203 No. West R. 632.\n3 [1937] 1 D.L.R. 137.\n4 [1891] A.C. 534.\n5 (1871) L.R. 12 Eq. 574.\n6 [1902] 2 Ch. 642.\n7 (1904) 40 N.S.R. 481.\n8 [1939] 1 D.L.R. 263.\n9 [1924] S.C.R. 625.\n10 (1886) 12 S.C.R. 45 at 54.\n11 [1934] S.C.R. 280 at 284.\n12 [1940] S.C.R. 511.\n13 [1925] S.C.R. 499 at 502.\n14 28 M.P.R. 380.\n15 [1893] 2 Oh. 41.\n16 [1941] Ch. 308.\n17 (1946) 19 M.P.R. 298.\n18 [1891] A.C. 531.\n19 (1929) 98 L.J.

Ltd., [1953] 1 S.C.R. 19\nDate: 1952-10-07\nThe Canadian Indemnity Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAndrews & George Company Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: June 9, 10; 1952: October 7.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Kellock, Estey and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Insurance\u2014Sale of Goods\u2014Indemnity against liability imposed by law caused by accident arising out of condition in vendor's product after possession passed to another\u2014Defective glue causing damage to vendee's product\u2014Whether defect an accident\u2014Whether liability assumed by agreement or imposed by law\u2014Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C., 1948, c. 294, ss. 21, 58.\nThe respondent sold and delivered a quantity of glue to a lumber company to be used in the manufacture of plywood. Owing to the respondent's ignorance that its testing appliance was out of order, the glue supplied was defective and as a result the lumber company sustained damages, which the respondent paid. It then brought this action against the appellant upon a business liability insurance policy to recover the amount of such damages. Before this Court the only claim advanced was upon Endorsement 10(1) whereby the insurer undertook \"To indemnify the Insured against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured for damage to or destruction of property of others caused by accident during the policy period and arising out of the handling or use of or the existence of any condition in merchandise products or containers manufactured, sold, or handled by the Insured after the Insured has relinquished possession of such merchandise products or containers to others and away from the premises owned by, leased to or controlled by the Insured.\" By Exception A to this endorsement it was provided that the policy should not cover \"Damage to or destruction of property where the Insured has assumed liability therefor under the terms of any contract or agreement.\" Under Endorsement 11(1) the insurer undertook \"to pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed by law upon the Insured or by written contract for damage to or destruction of property of others of any or every description not hereinafter excepted, resulting solely and directly from an accident due to the operations of the Insured as stated in the said Policy\u2026\"\nHeld: Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and restoring that of the trial judge, that the action should be dismissed.\nPer: Kerwin and Estey JJ.: (1) The defective condition of the glue was unsuspected and undesired and therefore there was an \"accident\" which caused damage to the \"property of others\"; (2) it was not necessary that such accident should occur \"after the Insured had relinquished possession of such merchandise products\u2026 to others and away from the premises owned\u2026 by the Insured\" but it was sufficient if the damage should so arise. So held upon the construction of the endorsement but, in any event, being capable of that construction, the endorsement must be construed contra proferentem; (3) by s. 21 of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 294, there is an implied condition in certain circumstances as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale. Within the terms of Exception A to Endorsement 10(1) the respondent assumed liability for the damage under the terms of the contract between it and the lumber company, particularly in view of the fact that Endorsement 11(1) includes both liability imposed by law and that imposed by written contract. The implied condition under the Sale of Goods Act is as much a term of the contract as if it had been expressly stated therein; (4) in view of Exception A it is unnecessary to consider whether the rule in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562, and Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Limited [1936] A.C. 85, applied between the immediate parties to a contract so as to raise the contention that the lumber company had a cause of action against the respondent as well in tort as in contract.\nPer: Rand J.: (1) There was no accident and in any event none occurred after the respondent had parted with possession of the glue; (2) the phrase \"liability imposed by law\" in Endorsement 10(1) does not include liability arising under contract. This is put beyond controversy by the inclusion in Endorsement 11(1) of liability \"imposed by law\u2026 or by written contract\"; (3) under the rule in Donoghue v. Stevenson the duty of care by the respondent in the manufacture of the glue extended to the immediate purchaser, the lumber company; but (4) that duty did not arise out of a contract, notwithstanding s. 21 of the Sale of Goods Act.\nPer: Kellock J.: The damage for which indemnity was given by Endorsement 10(1) was not damage arising after the respondent had relinquished possession of the glue but damage caused by accident so arising, and the respondent failed to show any accident within the meaning of the Endorsement.\nCartwright J. concurred with those parts of the reasons of Kerwin and Rand JJ. which held that any possible liability was excluded by the terms of Exception A to Endorsement 10(1).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal[1] reversing the judgment of Farris, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia at the trial[2] , dismissing the plaintiff's claim to recover under a policy of insurance against business liability.\nD. McK. Brown for the appellant.\nJ.A. MacInnes Q.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKERWIN J.:\u2014Among other businesses carried on by the respondent is the making of glue and the sale thereof to lumber companies for use in their manufacture of plywood. One of these lumber companies, Canadian Western Lumber Company, Limited, purchased a quantity of glue from the respondent under an open oral contract. The glue was not fit for the purpose for which it was supplied as it showed defective lamination or adhesion, and the respondent paid the lumber company the sum of $9,159.79 which, as between the parties to this litigation, it is agreed is the amount of the damage sustained by the lumber company. This action to recover that amount from the appellant was based upon the terms of endorsement No. 10 to what is called a comprehensive business liability policy, issued by the appellant to the respondent and a number of other insured. Before the Court of Appeal the respondent also relied on endorsements 2 and 11, but in this Court the claim was restricted as at the trial.\nThe policy is dated November 17, 1947, for the period from noon, November 30, 1947, to noon, November 30, 1950. By it, the appellant agreed to indemnify the insured against certain liabilities with which we are not concerned but the policy is made subject to certain conditions, one of which may be noted:\u2014\nB. This policy applies only to accidents or occurrences which originate during the policy period.\nEndorsements Nos. 10 and 11 to the policy are dated November 30, and by endorsement No. 12, dated December 2, 1947, the additional premium to cover \"Damage to property of others as per Endorsements No. 10 and No. 11\" was fixed at $426.67. By clause 1 of endorsement No. 10, in consideration of the additional premium, the policy was extended:\u2014\n1. TO INDEMNIFY the Insured against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured for damage to or destruction of property of others caused by accident during the policy period and arising out of the handling or use of or the existence of any condition in merchandise products or containers manufactured, sold, or handled by the Insured after the Insured has relinquished possession of such merchandise products or containers to others and away from premises owned by, leased to or controlled by the Insured ; The first question is whether the damage suffered by the lumber company was caused by accident. I agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that it was, although not resting that conclusion in any respect on there being, as the Court of Appeal held, \"nothing in the glue ingredients nor in the glue itself which was inflammable or explosive\", since there is no evidence in the record upon which to base such a finding. The evidence does show that the glue sold to the lumber company had been prepared and tested in the usual manner by the respondent but that, owing to the appliance used by it for testing being out of order, a misleading result was achieved. As a consequence of further investigation, a number of possibilities emerged as to the manner in which the defect in the glue had occurred but the cause was left undetermined. Under these circumstances, the defective condition was unsuspected and undesired and, therefore, there was an accident which caused the damage to \"property of others\".\nThe trial judge considered that to be within the terms of clause 1 the accident must have occurred \"after the insured has relinquished possession\u2026 to others and away from premises owned by, leased to or controlled by the insured.\" If that be so, it is the end of the matter as it cannot be successfully argued that any accident occurred after the glue had left the respondent's possession. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge's construction of the clause and I think they were right in deciding that it is the damage only that must occur after the events specified. In view of condition B in the policy itself, the words in clause 1 of endorsement 10 \"during the policy period\" may be disregarded. With them deleted, the clause would then read: \"To indemnify the Insured against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured for damage to or destruction of property of others caused by accident and arising out of the handling or use, etc.\", and the word \"arising\" relates to \"damage to or destruction of property of others\" and not to \"accident\". Furthermore, it is appropriate to speak of damage or destruction, rather than accident \"arising out of the handling or use, etc.\" In any event it is open to that interpretation and the clause must be construed contra proferentem. However, the respondent must bring itself within the opening words of clause 1 by which the appellant agreed to indemnify the insured against the liability \"imposed by law\" upon it. These words also appear in the policy and in endorsements Nos. 2, 7 and 11. Clause 1 of endorsement 11 reads:\u2014\n1. TO PAY on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed by law upon the Insured or by written contract for damage to or destruction of property of others of any or every description not hereinafter excepted, resulting solely and directly from an accident due to the operations of the Insured as stated in the said Policy, provided such damage or destruction occurs during the policy period;\nThis endorsement was added at the same time as No. 10 and both are part of the policy. While endorsement 11 contemplates an entirely different class of risk, the inclusion therein of \"the liability imposed\u2026 upon the Insured\u2026 by written contract\" indicates that the phrase \"imposed by law\" in endorsement 10 does not include a liability imposed upon the respondent as a result of its own volition in entering into the contract with the lumber company. \"As the relation of contractor and contractee is voluntary, the consequences attaching to the relation must be voluntary\" (Holmes', The Common Law, p. 302). To the same effect, in expanded form, is Chitty on Contracts, 20th edition, page 3:\u2014\nIt therefore appears that, as stated above, the kind of obligation involved in a contract is that which the parties themselves intend shall be created. It arises from their volition and is not imposed on them ab extra by the law. A and B are not obliged to enter into any contract unless they wish to do so; if they do so, they create their own obligation, the one to the other; they intend that their bargain shall, if necessary, be enforced by the law.\nThe fact that s. 21 of the Sale of Goods Act R.S.B.C. 1948, chapter 294, provides that in certain circumstances there shall be an implied condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, and that s. 58 provides for damages for breach of such a condition (treated as a warranty) does not affect the matter. If the lumber company's cause of action against the respondent were based only on contract, the latter's liability for damage to the former's property was not imposed by law upon the respondent within the meaning of clause 1 of endorsement 10. We have not had the benefit of argument as to whether the rule expounded in Donoghue v. Stevenson[3], and Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd.[4] , applies between the immediate parties to a contract in order to raise the contention that the lumber company had a cause of action against the respondent as well in tort as in contract. In view of exception A to the indemnity provided by clause 1 of endorsement 10, it is unnecessary to deal with the point. That exception runs:\u2014\nA. Damage to or destruction of property where the Insured has assumed a liability therefor under the terms of any contract or agreement.\nThe respondent assumed liability for the damage under the terms of the contract between it and the lumber company since the implied condition provided for by s. 21 of the Sale of Goods Act is as much a term as if it had been expressly stated therein.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored.\nRAND J.:\u2014The indemnity insurance undertaken by the appellant is admittedly of a type designed generally to meet the extended liability imposed on manufacturers by the rule laid down in Donoghue v. Stevenson[5] and followed in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Limited[6] , and that circumstance is significant among the commercial facts which furnish the background to the policy. The latter, subject to the long established qualifications, must, of course, be read according to the ordinary meaning of its language; but \"meaning\" itself has rather shadowy boundaries, and even ordinary language must, for a true understanding of what the parties meant by it, be construed in the context and the circumstances out of which it has arisen. When the words are in the form of legal expressions which have no fixed or precise definition, those circumstances become so much more necessary to enable us to appreciate the mental perspectives of the parties when they bargained. Endorsement No. 10 is the provision under which the claim is made. By s. 1 the company agrees to indemnify the respondent against\nThe liability imposed by law upon the Insured for damage to or destruction of property of others caused by accident during the policy period and arising out of the handling or use of or the existence of any condition in merchandise products or containers manufactured, sold, or handled by the Insured after the Insured has relinquished possession of such merchandise products or containers to others and away from premises owned by leased to or controlled by the Insured;\nThe question is whether that clause applies to what may be taken as a negligent production of inferior glue which, being used to make laminated lumber, produced a grade below what proper glue would have done and involved, therefore, a breach of warranty of fitness.\nThe policy contains an exclusion, among others, of liability for \"damage to or destruction of property where the Insured has assumed liability therefor under the terms of any contract or agreement;\".\nEndorsement No. 11 provided a further indemnity in the following words:\u2014\n1. TO PAY on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed by law\u2026 or by written contract for damage to or destruction of property of others\u2026 resulting\u2026 from an accident due to the operations of the Insured\u2026\nI take the phrase liability \"imposed by law\" in No. 10 to mean, as distinguished from liability arising under contract. I should have done that from the context alone, but the inclusion in No. 11 of both \"imposed by law\u2026 or by written contract\" seems to me to put the matter beyond controversy.\nAlthough there is a warranty, is there also a collateral co-existing right in tort based on negligence? Whether the rule of Donoghue v. Stevenson[7] runs in favour of the immediate purchaser from the manufacturer has not apparently been expressly decided. But I can see no reason why the general duty of the manufacturer should not extend to his purchaser, the first in the direct line of those within the scope of the potential mischief. Where warranty is excluded, what is there in the policy of the law to deny him the same relief from the effects, say, of an explosion as would be accorded a purchaser from him on the same terms? An exclusion of warranty does not necessarily involve a release of the general duty of care in manufacture; and I should say that the duty does extend to the immediate purchaser.\nDoes the sale, then, with warranty impliedly absorb all other liability that would, in its absence, arise out of the transaction? Where a contract expressly or by implication of fact provides for a performance with care, as in the case of carriers, the general duty is clearly not displaced and the person injured or damaged in property may sue either in contract or tort. As a settlement was made here without action, it cannot be said in what right the claim was pressed or discharged, though all liability would be satisfied.\nBut the question seems to be disposed of by the exclusion (A) from liability \"assumed\u2026 under the terms of any contract or agreement\", unless Mr. MacInnes is right when he argues that the warranty is provided by the Sale of Goods Act and not by the contract.\nNo doubt every liability enforceable in the courts is, in one sense, created by law: if there were no legal order, there would be no civil rights as we know them enforced by the power of the community. But it is not in that sense that the words must be taken to be used: here again they imply a contrast between liability arising in respect of contractual relations, and that in respect of matters outside of agreement.\nAt common law the warranty was deemed to be an element of the intention of the parties: the purchaser was buying something that would accomplish a certain purpose and placed reliance in the seller who, in effect, undertook to furnish such a thing: it was a term of the bargain. The statute has crystallized that element but only as a term, which by agreement can be excluded. The right to damages is a creation of law annexed to the contract as an incident; and the \"assumption of liability\" is effected by entering into a contract to which are annexed both the warranty and the remedial right in case of breach. The liability is one, therefore, that has been assumed by contract.\nThe indemnity, moreover, is seen to be limited to damage \"caused by accident\". This presupposes a tortious act by the manufacturer creating a liability to which an accident, in the strictly legal sense of the term, could not of itself give rise. Grammatically and in, I think, the true sense, it is related to the damage, not the liability: and in that sense, the accident must eventuate when the possession of the goods has passed to another than the manufacturer. Such cases can easily be imagined as, for instance, explosions and similar mishaps.\nWas the damage here, then, produced by such an accident? The glue was used no doubt in the belief that it was of proper quality but the possibility that it was not was always present to the minds of the purchasers who tested it regularly in the course of production; but the test involved a time lag which accounts for the substantial damage. To treat mistaken action of that nature as \"accident\" would render the word superfluous. What is meant is something out of the ordinary or the likely, something fortuitous, unusual and unexpected, not, in the ordinary course, guarded against.\nIt was argued that, on such a construction, no liability could ever arise since an \"accident\" in that sense, resulting from defective glue, is inconceivable. No evidence was directed to that point and there is no factual basis for such a conclusion. The language of the indemnity applied to a number of different businesses and necessarily it was general. But what the parties had in mind were possibilities difficult if not impossible to foresee: what they clearly did not aim at were direct and expectable damages from the daily risks which it was part of their business of production and sale to face and eliminate. These are the ordinary consequences of a breach of warranty of fitness, a liability as old as warranty itself.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the judgment at trial restored with costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014In this case the respondent brought action to recover from the appellant the sum of $9,159.79 paid by the respondent to the Canadian Western Lumber Company Limited, being the agreed amount of damage sustained by the lumber company in using, in the manufacture of its plywood, glue manufactured and sold to it by the respondent, it being admitted by the respondent, a fact which the appellant also accepts, that the glue was not fit for the purpose for which it was supplied to the lumber company. The respondent claimed the amount of this loss from the appellant under the terms of a policy of insurance, the relevant provision of which is as follows:\nTo indemnify the Insured against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured for damage to or destruction of property of others caused by accident during the policy period and arising out of the handling or use of or the existence of any condition in merchandise products or containers manufactured, sold, or handled by the Insured after the Insured has relinquished possession of such merchandise products or containers to others and away from premises owned by leased to or controlled by the Insured.\nThe glue in question is of a type known as phenolic resin glue, the basic ingredients of which are phenol, for-maldehyde and caustic. The glue was deficient in adhesive strength which resulted in the plywood not being up to the standard, and it was sold at a lower price in consequence.\nThe process of manufacture of the glue is carried out by heating the ingredients until a chemical reaction takes place, and the volatile ingredients are driven off, leaving a residue composed of from forty to forty-five per cent of non-volatile solids.\nThe particular glue which was shipped to the lumber company was composed in fact of thirty-six to thirty-seven per cent only of these solids, but this condition was not discovered by the respondent owing to the fact that the apparatus which it used to test its product did not record the actual condition of the glue. The apparatus itself is a small oven in which a portion of the glue is kept under constant temperature during testing, the heat being kept constant by reason of a thermostat control. The servants of the respondent had not checked the thermostat for a period of nine months, and were not aware that it was not functioning. Evidence was given on behalf of the appellant that it was standard practice to make a check of such apparatus at least once a week. The learned trial judge found that the reason for the glue being defective had been left a complete mystery on the evidence. While in his view the defect was due to accident, nevertheless, he was of opinion that, under the terms of Endorsement No. 10, the respondent could not recover as the accident referred to in the policy was one occurring after the glue had left the possession of the respondent. He also held that in any event the respondent could not recover as the liability of the respondent was not a liability \"imposed by law\" within the meaning of the endorsement but a liability assumed by the respondent under its contract with the lumber company which was excluded by express exception.\nThis judgment was set aside on appeal. In the view of the Court of Appeal, on a proper construction of the endorsement, the respondent was entitled to recover if the damage arose after the glue had left the respondent's premises although the accident occurred prior thereto. The court also disagreed as to the applicability of the term of exclusion.\nIn my opinion, the damage for which indemnity is given by the endorsement is damage caused by an accident (a) which occurs during the term of the policy and (b) which arises \"after\" the goods have left the insured's premises. It is the contention of the respondent that the qualifying words following the word \"accident\" relate not to \"accident\" but to the preceding word \"damage,\" and that therefore it is immaterial if the accident occurred on the premises of the insured. I do not think the endorsement can be so read. In my opinion, the \"accident\" contemplated is an accident \"arising out of the handling\u2026 or use of\u2026 or condition in\" the products \"after\" the insured has relinquished possession. In other words, it is not \"damage\" arising after the insured has relinquished possession of the goods, but damage caused by \"accident\" so arising. In my opinion, therefore, the respondent failed to show any accident within the meaning of the endorsement.\nThe Court of Appeal appears to have been influenced in reaching their decision by the consideration thus expressed in the judgment of Robertson J.A.:\nThere was nothing in the glue ingredients or in the glue itself which was inflammable or explosive, nor was any damage to be apprehended in connection with its manufacture. There was not any danger of this sort to be feared by its customers. There would only be one thing for which it required protection, viz., some accidental fault in the manufacture of the glue which affected its value or rendered it unfit for the purpose for which it was being sold. As pointed out by the appellant, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding of this nature. This consideration is therefore not available to affect the ordinary grammatical construction of the language used, whatever might otherwise have been the case.\nIt is not necessary to consider the other questions argued. I would allow the appeal with costs here and below.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed. For the reasons given on this branch of the matter by my brothers Kerwin and Rand and by the learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial, I am of opinion that even if the appellant would otherwise have been under liability (a question which I find it unnecessary to determine) such liability is negatived by the terms of Exclusion (A) of Endorsement 10, quoted in the reasons of my brother Kerwin.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

The first of these had been built in 1945 and sold in 1946; the second had been commenced in 1946 and sold in the summer of 1947 and construction of the third had been commenced in 1948 and sold in that year before it was completed.\nThe appellant appealed to the Income Tax Appeal Board contending that his purpose in building each of the apartments was as an investment in the expectation of receiving an income from the rentals and providing living accomodation for himself and his family. The Board held upon the evidence that the profits were not realized from the enhancement in value of an ordinary investment but rather from what was in fact the carrying on of a business. An appeal to the Exchequer Court from this decision was dismissed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed, there being evidence upon which the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court might properly hold that the appellant was carrying on the business of constructing the buildings for the purpose of resale at a profit.\nCalifornian Copper Syndicate v.

[1914] A.C. 1001 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Sydney Smith, Deputy Judge, dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board and holding that the appellant was assessable for income tax.\nA. S. Gregory for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.\u2014The question to be determined in the present matter is as to whether certain profits realized by the appellant in the taxation years 1946, 1947 and 1948 were income, within the meaning of that term as defined by subsection 1 of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act (c. 97, R.S.C. 1927 as amended). The subsection, so far as relevant, reads:\u2014\nFor the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere.\nTo the income as reported by the appellant in his income tax returns there was added by the Minister a sum of $2,000 for the taxation year 1946, $29,500 for the year 1947 and $31,880 for the year 1948, these amounts being profits made by him on the sale of three apartment blocks, which he had caused to be constructed in the City of Vancouver between the years 1945 and 1948. The first of these, the Promenade Apartments, had been built in the year 1945 and sold in the month of April 1946; the second called the Seacrest, the construction of which was commenced in 1946 was sold in the summer of 1947 and the third called the Harcrest, the construction of which was commenced in March of 1948 was sold by the appellant in that year, before completion.\nThe appellant appealed to the Income Tax Appeal Board. While the proceedings before that court are in form an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, the hearings are in the nature of a trial in which both parties are entitled to call evidence. In the present matter, the appellant gave evidence before the Board in support of his contention that his purpose in building the first of these apartments was as an investment in the expectation of receiving an income from the rentals, at the same time affording living accommodation for himself and his family in one of the suites, and that it was due to unforeseen circumstances that it became necessary for him to sell the property.The two other blocks were built with the same end in view, according to the appellant, and in each case it was necessary for him to sell for reasons which he had not foreseen when undertaking the construction. The appellant accordingly contended that the profits realized were in the nature of capital gains and did not fall within the definition of income in the statute. On cross-examination it was disclosed that in the year 1943 the appellant had sold an apartment block containing ten suites which he had had built some four years earlier and which, the appellant said, had been constructed for the same purpose as the apartments in question, and that in that year he had purchased a large house on Hudson Street which he intended to turn into suites and which, after it had been remodelled, he had sold.\nIn a carefully considered judgment the learned Assistant Chairman of the Income Tax Appeal Board, Mr. Fabio Monet, Q.C. found that the appellant had realized the profits in question while engaged in carrying on a business or activity, within the meaning of subsection 1 of section 3. Mr. Monet, with whose reasons for judgment Mr. W. S. Fisher, Q.C, the other member of the Board who presided at the hearing agreed, applying the principle stated in the judgment of the Lord Justice-Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris 2, found that these were not profits realized from the enhancement in value of an ordinary investment but rather from what was in fact the carrying on of a business. Considering, however, that the appellant had been improperly assessed in the sum of $2,000 for the taxation year 1946, his appeal in this respect was allowed, the assessment for the year 1947 amended by deducting from it the amount of $300. The appeal in respect of the year 1948 was dismissed.\nThe proceedings on an appeal in such matters to the Exchequer Court are in the nature of a trial de novo and the appellant again gave evidence in that Court 3 and was cross-examined at length, and further evidence was given by his wife as to the reasons which had led her husband to sell certain of the properties. In the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Sidney Smith 4 he expressed the opinion that on the evidence the appellant was carrying on a trade, business or calling for the purpose of making profits during the periods in question, saying that his reasons for this conclusion of fact were substantially those of the learned Assistant Chairman of the Income Tax Appeal Board and that he agreed with the latter's statement as to the applicable principles of law. On the evidence before him he held, however, that for the year 1946 $8,700 should be added to the amount of the assessment and a like amount deducted from that made in the year 1947: for the year 1948 he considered the amount as found by the Board should remain unchanged and, with these variations, dismissed the appeal.\nWhile the proceedings before the Income Tax Appeal Board under the provisions of the Income Tax Act are by way of appeal from decisions of the Minister, the proceedings in the present matter are indistinguishable from those upon the trial of issues in other courts of record. By subsection 2 of section 91 of the Act, upon completion of the steps required by the statute on an appeal to the Exchequer Court, the matter is to be deemed as an action in that Court and the proceedings are conducted in the same manner as in other actions. The question as to whether the appellant was engaged during the years in question in carrying on the business of building apartment blocks with a view to reselling them at a profit is one of fact. While the decision in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris turned upon the interpretation of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842, the passage from the judgment of the Lord Justice-Clerk, referred to in the judgment of the learned Assistant Chairman, in my opinion, expresses the principle which is applicable here. In delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust Limited 5, Lord Dunedin quotes with approval the passage from the judgment in the Californian Copper Syndicate case reading:\u2014\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of income tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to income tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business.\n[page 7]\nThe learned members of the Income Tax Appeal Board having heard the evidence of the appellant did not accept his statement that he had caused to be built these various properties for the purposes of investment and concluded that in truth he was carrying on the business of constructing them for the purpose of resale at a profit. The learned Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court having again heard the appellant's evidence in the matter has come to the same conclusion. Mr. Gregory's able argument for the appellant has failed to satisfy me that there is any ground upon which we are justified in interfering with these findings.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Pursuant to a request, which was not made by the respondent executor, the appellant caused burial services to be conducted for and the body of the testatrix, a Jewess, to be buried in its cemetery. There was no communication between the appellant and the respondent until after this had been done. The appellant claimed to recover a fee for its services in an amount fixed by a committee of seven persons, members of its synagogue and in fixing such amount the committee took into account the financial circumstances of the testatrix, her mode of life and other considerations, a method it alleged to be authorized by usage and custom in respect to persons of the Jewish faith. The respondent brought an amount into Court with its defence and the trial judge gave judgment in an amount less than the sum so paid in. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.\nHeld: (Rand J. dissenting) that upon the evidence the only liability of the respondent as executor was to pay a fair and reasonable amount for the services rendered, and as such amount had been awarded at the trial, the appeal failed. The King v. Wade 5 Price 622 at 627; Tugwell v. Heyman 3 Camp. 298; Corner v. Shew 3 M. & W. 350 at 354 applied.\nPer: Kellock J. Assuming the usage and custom pleaded could be considered either reasonable or certain, there was nothing in the evidence which established the existence of either. Neither did the will contain anything upon which the appellant could claim against the estate other than the common law basis of liability of personal representatives with respect to funeral expenses.\nPer: Rand J. (dissenting)\u2014A contractual basis is inappropriate to the claim and the obligation to pay arises by way of bequest. Appeal by plaintiff from a Judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal[1], affirming the judgment of Clyne J.[2] .\nJ. W. deB. Farris Q.C. for the appellant.\nAlfred Bull Q.C. and P. R. Brissenden for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014The appellant is a society incorporated under the provisions of the Benevolent Societies Act, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 19, whose objects are described in its amended declaration as being religious, philanthropic, charitable, social, educational and fraternal, with power to hold lands for the purpose of erecting a house of worship for those of the Jewish religion and to acquire lands for the purpose of maintaining a \"burial ground for burial privileges\" for persons of that faith. The Society in due course erected a synagogue for the members of the Schara Tzedeck Congregation and established a cemetery known as the Schara Tzedeck Cemetery, on Marine Drive in the City of Vancouver.\nBy her last will and testament made on September 11, 1924, Jennie Edith McIntyre, therein described as having been born Waga, and sometimes using and known by the name of Jennie Green, of Sandon, B.C. appointed the respondent company as executor and trustee and, after making various minor bequests, directed that the moneys realized from the estate should be divided equally between her father, mother, brothers and sisters, described as resident in Russian Poland, and further directed that her body should be buried \"in a Jewish cemetery in my own burial plot in a casket suitable to a person of my means and that a suitable head stone shall be placed on my grave and that the cost thereof shall be paid as part of my testamentary expenses.\"\nJennie Edith Mclntyre died at Nelson, B.C. on December 9, 1946. She was of the Jewish faith and shortly thereafter Mr. David A. Chertkow, a member of the Bar of British Columbia practising in Vancouver and the General Secretary of the Cemetery Board of the Society, received a telephone call from Nelson informing him of the death, that the deceased had been a Jewess and asking whether the Society would accept her body for burial. The name of the person who spoke to Mr. Chertkow does not appear and apparently neither the latter nor any of the other active members of the Society knew Mrs. McIntyre. On the examination for discovery of Mr. Diamond, the President of the Cemetery Board of the appellant Society, Mr. Chertkow had appeared as counsel and, after consultation with him, Mr. Diamond said that they did not know who it was that had telephoned to Mr. Chertkow from Nelson. After receiving this message the Board had made inquiries sufficient to satisfy them that the deceased had been a Jewess: thereupon her body having been shipped from Nelson was buried in the casket in which it arrived without further inquiry, the services being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Orthodox Jewish faith. No one on behalf of the appellant Society got in touch with the Royal Trust Company until after the funeral. Neither Mr. Chertkow nor any one connected with the appellant knew the contents of the will and were thus not informed that there was a direction that the body should be buried \"in a Jewish cemetery in my own burial plot\", and accordingly the burial was in what was described by him as a single grave. Burial was on December 15, 1946, and an account was rendered to the executors by the Cemetery Board on March 1, 1947.\nThe statement of claim, after describing the nature and objects of the Society and its ownership of the cemetery and that it carries out the functions of and is a registered undertaker, alleged that the Schara Tzedeck Cemetery Board, a committee appointed annually, has complete charge of burial arrangements and maintains and operates the cemetery, and that:\u2014\nthe said Board has the sole right and discretion to set and arrange a burial fee in accordance with the principles of the Jewish faith, taking into consideration, amongst other things, the character and nature of the deceased; the value of his or her estate; the persons dependent for support upon the said estate; and the manner in which the deceased in his or her lifetime discharged his or her obligations of giving and doing charity in accordance with the principles of the Jewish faith. After alleging that the deceased was a person of the Jewish faith, it alleged that:\u2014\nthe said Board was called upon to perform the last rites.\nand that this was done. By whom the Board was requested to do this was not stated. These allegations, however, were followed by a claim for moneys payable by the defendant to the plaintiff for goods, services, materials provided and moneys paid by the plaintiff for the defendant in and about the funeral of the said deceased, this being followed by a claim for $3,000 \"total fees as set by the Board.\" These various allegations were put in issue by the statement of defence, the denials being followed by an allegation that it had been arranged between the parties that the plaintiff would provide a grave in its cemetery and attend to the burial of the said Jennie Edith Mclntyre, but that the amount to be paid had not been agreed upon and that the claim was exorbitant. No reply was filed and these pleas were accordingly put in issue. Presumably the claim that there had been an arrangement made between the parties for the burial in advance of December 15 was not in accordance with the facts since no evidence was tendered to support it, the evidence tendered for the defendant on this aspect of the matter being therefore unchallenged. The statement of defence, in addition, alleged that the defendant had at all times been ready and willing to pay the plaintiff a reasonable amount for the grave and the burial and brought into court the sum of $1,000 as a sum ample to satisfy the claim.\nAt the trial before Clyne J. written admissions of the defendant were filed to the effect that the charges of commercial undertakers for undertaking, funerals, burial and cemetery services of the kind provided by the plaintiff to the deceased would amount from $200 to $600; that the defendant had no knowledge until some time after the funeral of the basis upon which the Society or any like Jewish organization fixed its charges for such services and that, under Jewish religious law and in accordance with Jewish custom, Jewish burial societies charged for the carrying out of burial rites on any one of three bases, namely, by a set fee which is the same for all members or by a fixed percentage of the estate of the deceased or by setting a fee in accordance with the principles of the Jewish faith, taking into consideration amongst other things the value of the estate, the persons dependent upon the estate for support and the manner in which the deceased in her lifetime discharged her obligations of giving and doing charity in accordance with the principles of the Jewish faith, and that the plaintiff Society had since its origin adopted the last mentioned basis.\nThe evidence disclosed that the appellant Society appoints annually a committee of seven persons, members of its synagogue, who are designated as the Schara Tzedeck Cemetery Board, which is charged, inter alia, with the maintenance of the cemetery and the setting of the fees which are charged to estates of deceased persons for their burial. Mr. Chertkow, as secretary of this committee, wrote to the estates' officer of the respondent on July 22, 1947, explaining the manner in which the Board had fixed the fee of $3,000 shown in the account which had been rendered on March 1st of that year, pointing out that neither the persons who performed the last rites nor the members of the Board received any remuneration for their services which were performed as a religious duty to enable persons of the Jewish faith to receive a proper burial in accordance with the orthodox rites and customs of that faith and that in many cases they conducted burials without charge for the estates of persons unable to pay, that in fixing the charges made the Board took into consideration the character and nature of the deceased person, whether being financially able such person had discharged his or her religious duty of giving and doing charity in his or her lifetime for the assistance of those who were less fortunate, that the estates of people of means must pay for the burial of the poor of the Jewish faith, and that the Board considered the person's character, whether he or she had lived a good and proper life \"judging from moral standards to which all people adhere to.\" The letter further stated that the Board endeavoured to be practical and applied these principles equitably and without hardship for the remaining dependents, that as regards the estate of Mrs. Mclntyre the value of her estate far exceeded the value of most of the estates left by other Jews, that in her lifetime she had been removed from her people and did not discharge her charitable duties and \"that her manner of living left much to be desired\", that, as she left no immediate family or infants dependent upon her, sufficient would remain to take care of any remote relatives that would share under the terms of the will, and that, in addition to failing to give to Jewish charities in her lifetime, the deceased did not by her will make any bequest to such charities, while specifically providing for Jewish burial.\nMr. Chertkow gave evidence at the trial and produced a list of the amounts which had been charged for the burial of various people of the Jewish faith in Vancouver during a period of five years prior to the time of the trial where, he said, the amounts charged had been fixed upon this basis. Of the three methods of fixing the charges referred to in the admissions, the one commonly known among Jews in Canada, in his opinion, was that of charging a fee in accordance with the ability of the estate to pay. Rabbi Kogen of the Congregation Beth Israel of Vancouver, gave evidence as to the great importance attached by people of the Jewish faith to having their bodies buried in Jewish cemeteries according to the Jewish ritual, and said that he believed that it had been the universal custom among Jews for many centuries and was now the custom that everybody was buried in the same manner and that the estates of the rich paid more than those of the poor. While in the case of members of his congregation there was an arrangement with the Schara Tzedeck Cemetery Board for the payment of a fixed fee which was the same for all, this was an exception to the common rule. This witness said further that giving to charity was considered to be an obligation upon every Jew. Rabbi Mozeson agreed with the evidence given by Rabbi Kogen.\nMr. Justice Clyne who considered that the evidence showed that the respondent had caused arrangements to be made for the burial decided that the plaintiff's claim could be only for services rendered, the remuneration to be such as in the circumstances would be just and reasonable, being of the opinion that the usage alleged was uncertain and had not been proved. Based upon the admission as to the charge on an ordinary commercial basis, he fixed the sum of $400 as being reasonable and allowed this amount, giving the plaintiff costs up to the time of the payment into court and the defendant the subsequent costs of the action in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court. The present appellant's appeal from this judgment was dismissed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is clear from the evidence that there was no. express contract made between the respondent and the appellant for the burial of the body of the deceased and it was, no doubt, for this reason that the statement of claim merely asserted that the Board had been called upon to perform the last rites. The only evidence of any request to the appellant to bury the body of Jennie Edith Mclntyre in its cemetery was of that made by some person in Nelson whose name was not disclosed and it was admitted by Mr. Diamond in his examination that no other instructions from any source were received. That this person was acting for or on behalf of the respondent was neither alleged nor proven. The services were not rendered in reliance upon the terms of the will since its existence was not known to the officers of the appellant Society until after the burial. If there is any liability in contract on the part of the respondent, therefore, it must be upon a contract to be implied by law in these circumstances.\nThe respondent in this matter properly admitted its liability to pay the reasonable cost of the burial of the testator and paid the sum of $1,000 into Court with the defence as sufficient to satisfy the claim. Apart from the fact that the Administration Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 6, s. 153) provides that claims for funeral expenses not exceeding $100 shall be preferred as heretofore, neither the nature nor the extent of the liability of the executor is affected by any statute in force in British Columbia. At common law a duty is imposed upon an executor to see that the deceased is buried in a manner befitting his or her station in life and that no undue expense is incurred. In Williams on Executors, 12th Ed. p. 610, the learned author says that if the deceased has left directions as to the disposal of his body, though these are not legally binding on the personal representative, effect should be given to his wishes as far as is possible. The executor is liable to pay the reasonable funeral expenses, even without any order on his part, if he has assets available for the purpose (The King v. Wade[3] ; Sharp v. Lush[4] , Jessel, M.R. at 472). In Tugwell v. Heyman[5] , where the executors had neglected to give orders for the funeral of a testator and the claim was for expenses incurred for furnishing a funeral, Lord Ellenborough said that it had been shown that the funeral was conducted in a manner suitable to the testator's degree and circumstances and that the plaintiff's charge was fair and reasonable and, the executors, not denying that they had assets available, the law implied a promise on their part to satisfy the demand. This was followed in Rogers v. Price[6] , by the Court of Exchequer. That the implied promise on the part of an executor who has assets to pay the reasonable expenses of such a funeral of his testator as is suitable to his degree and circumstances is a liability imposed upon the executor personally and not in his representative character was decided by Parke B. in delivering the judgment of the Court in Corner v. Shew[7] . It is impossible, in my opinion, to import into a contract implied under these circumstances any term by reason of the usage which the appellant seeks to establish in this matter. In so far as support for the claim is based upon custom, it would have been necessary for the appellants to establish that a custom to charge the estate of deceased Jewish persons in the manner described in the letter from Mr. Chertkow had obtained the force of law in the locality and thus taken the place of the common law in respect of the matter (10 Hals. p. 2) and this was not done.\nThe appellant's claim is pleaded in contract but in the course of the argument addressed to us some support is sought for it under the terms of the will. Since I think all the available evidence was given at the trial, it is proper in a case such as this to consider this aspect of the matter, even though the claim is not so pleaded. I am unable, with respect for other opinions, to understand how there can be any claim upon this basis. It is contended in the factum of the appellant that the executor was bound by law pursuant to the directions of the will, to bury the body in a Jewish cemetery in which the testatrix had her own burial plot, but this statement is not supported by authority (Williams, 12th Ed. p. 610: 3 Hals. p. 457). Since the appellant does not claim qua beneficiary but simply as a creditor of the Royal Trust Company for services performed after her death, at the request of some person whose identity is not disclosed and who was neither the agent or the representative of the Trust Company, the terms of the will relating to the manner of her burial cannot affect the matter. It is also to be noted that the manner of the burial of the body was not that directed by the will, not being in her \"own burial plot\" and being in the casket in which the body had been forwarded from Nelson. Had the terms of the will as to the manner in which the testatrix wished her body to be buried been communicated to the appellant by the respondent in advance of the burial and had the directions of the will been complied with, the nature of the liability of the respondent would require consideration, but nothing of the kind took place in the present matter. In my opinion, no support can be found for any claim based upon the provision in the will.\nAs to the claim on a quantum meruit, the admission filed was to the effect that the charges of commercial undertakers for undertaking, funerals, burial and cemetery services of the kind provided by the plaintiff in respect of the deceased would amount to from $200 to $600. While the evidence is silent on the matter, such a charge would no doubt include a casket but would not either provide a grave or perpetual care of the grave, which the appellant Society provides for graves in the Schara Tzedeck Cemetery. The appellant did not give any evidence as to what would be regarded as a proper charge for the use of its chapel or for the services of the watchmen at the cemetery and the learned trial judge was required to deal with the matter upon the evidence afforded by the admission. The appellants did not supply a casket in the present case and I respectfully agree with Bird J.A. that there is nothing in the evidence to lead to the conclusion that the amount awarded by Clyne J. was other than just and reasonable.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. RAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The question raised on this appeal is the right of the appellant, a Jewish church society in Vancouver, to receive a sum for the burial with its accessory services of a deceased unmarried Jewish woman. The action is framed in contract, but it is agreed that if recovery is warranted on any ground the form of the claim may be disregarded.\nThe deceased died in 1946 at Nelson, B.C., where for some years she had resided: and her will, made in 1924, at a place called Sandon in the same province, contains the following provision:\u2014\nI Direct that I shall be buried in a Jewish cemetery in my own burial plot in a casket suitable to a person of my means and that a suitable headstone shall be placed on my grave and that the cost thereof shall be paid as part of my testamentary expenses.\nThe service of burial is one of the basic rites of the Jewish church law, and no member of that race can be buried in a Jewish cemetery without the prescribed ceremonial. By that law there is a duty on the Jewish community to accord the service in the same form to every member: all are treated on the same level: born equal, they are buried as equals. The ceremonies include preparation of the body, shrouds, coffin, use of the chapel and hearse, watchmen, interment, religious services and the grave with perpetual care. The Society here owns both the synagogue and the cemetery. In relation to burials, it has two governing bodies, a Board which administers the secular interests, and what is described as a Holy Society, members of which only can carry out the burial rites. The Board, among other duties, determines, according to church law, the assessment to be made on the burial ceremony. In this case, the rule of the Society was that generally adopted in Canada: it prescribed the determination of the contribution on a consideration of the entire circumstances of the life of the deceased: his conduct, his observance, generally, of Jewish law, his gifts to charity, the amount of his estate at death, the beneficiaries, the bequests, and, in short, all that the Board should deem relevant to the sum which, from his possessions, in the total circumstances the traditional judgment dictated. In many cases no charge is made, and the common saying is that the rich must pay for the poor, and that a grave cannot be opened without a great deal of money. That this procedure was carried out in good faith is not questioned.\nThe deceased left an estate of approximately $105,000. The only relatives suggested are parents, brothers and sisters who remained in Russia from where she came, but who are believed now to be dead. So far as inquiries disclosed, she had made no contributions to charity during her lifetime. The Board fixed the amount that should be paid at $3,000, and upon the refusal of the trustee to pay that sum, brought the action.\nIn the trial court, Clyne J., proceeding on the basis of an undertaker's charges for burial, allowed $450 as on a quantum meruit, and his judgment was affirmed on appeal.\nIn my opinion, that contractual basis is inappropriate to the claim made. The subject matter is a religious service with mystical implications, conceived as an entirety, which in most of its elements cannot be valued in terms of money. In the background of the Jewish religion and its law, looking to the future life as well as the past, that service carries to every Jew the deepest significance of all the rites of his people. It is somewhat analogous to extreme unction and other fundamental rites in other religions.\nWhat, then, did the testatrix have in mind when she directed her body to be given such a funeral and that \"the cost thereof shall be paid as part of my testamentary expenses.\"? She had previously in the will referred to the payment of \"my funeral and testamentary expenses\". The will had been drawn either by a lawyer or one who was familiar with the language of lawyers, but who probably had little or no knowledge or acquaintance with these rites or their associated tolls; and the words \"cost\" and \"expenses\" must be interpreted with that in mind. There is also the fact that, colloquially, \"cost\" would ordinarily be used to describe all payments directly related to such a service performed by third persons.\nIn the early '40's, the deceased had visited Vancouver and had, in some way, satisfied herself about burial. She spoke of this to a merchant acquaintance in Nelson and seemed to be at ease about it. In discussions between them at this period she made it quite evident that she was familiar with the burial charges under the church law which she summed up by repeating what has already been mentioned: the rich pay more and the poor less.\nHaving, undoubtedly, in mind that in relation to the burial service the church law would prescribe an assessment, by the provision of the will she expressed her intention that the last act relating to her existence on earth, believed by her to be significant to her future life, was to be fulfilled in all respects according to a rule of great antiquity which to her bore a sacred obligation. Included in that act was the payment of a sum of money designed, among other things, to accomplish finally the moral and secular duty owed by her during her lifetime as prescribed by her church law.\nThere is no question of public policy, of enforcing church laws, of uncertainty as to object or person entitled, or of anything of a similar nature. Assuming that her direction could have been disregarded by the trustee and an ordinary non-Jewish burial given, it is settled that under the law the trustee was at liberty to carry it out as was done. What is involved is merely the interpretation of the language of the instrument; and once the burial society became identified, and it is agreed that it was the proper and in fact the only society in Vancouver by which the desire of the deceased could be fulfilled, the direction became complete. Upon the performance of the services, therefore, the obligation to pay the money as by way of bequest arose and the right to demand it likewise.\nI would allow the appeal and direct judgment accordingly. All costs in all courts will be paid out of the estate, those of the Trust Company as between solicitor and client.\nKELLOCK, J.:\u2014The facts are set out in the judgment of my brother Locke and it is not necessary to repeat them. Appellant contends on the basis alternatively of custom or usage, that it has established a liability extending to the executor or administrator of a person of the Jewish faith to pay to those undertaking the burial such charges as they themselves determine, having regard to (a) the character and nature of the deceased person, judged from moral standards, (b) whether that person, being financially able, had discharged his or her religious duty in the doing and giving of charity in his or her lifetime for the care and assistance of his or her less fortunate brothers, (c) the size of the deceased person's estate, and (d) the existence or otherwise of dependents of the deceased.\nAssuming that, on either basis, such a custom or usage could be considered either reasonable or certain, I find nothing in the evidence which establishes the existence of any such custom or usage. Evidence such as that given by the witness Brook as to his own knowledge or that of the deceased that \"the rich pay more than the poor\" for funeral services, falls far short of the custom or usage alleged.\nNor do I think that the language of the will is to be interpreted as the appellant seeks to interpret it. In my view, with respect, the will contains nothing more than a direction to the executor which furnishes no ground upon which the appellant may claim against the estate other than the ordinary common law basis of liability upon which all personal representatives stand with respect to funeral expenses.\nOn the argument I had thought that perhaps the amount allowed by the learned trial judge did not take into consideration the fact that the appellant had undertaken to furnish perpetual care of the burial plot, but I think the written admission of the appellant does cover this item. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. A. Chertkow.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. R. Brissenden.\n[1] 5 W.W.R.

His appeal, mainly on grounds of misdirections on the issue of drunkenness which he had raised at the trial, was dismissed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, on the ground that, though some of the involved directions might have been objectionable or that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence supported no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event, no substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred.\nHeld (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. dissenting) : That the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nThe instructions given to the jury were confusing, incomplete, illegal and were not corrected. The appellant was not bound to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a condition such as did render his mind incapable of forming the pertinent specific intent essential to constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury should have been clearly instructed that the accused should only be found guilty of manslaughter if, in their view, the evidence indicated such incapacity or left them in doubt as to the matter. (Latour v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 19 referred to).\nOn the evidence, it cannot be safely asserted that the jury, properly instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found itself in. doubt as to the accused's incapacity, on account of drunkenness, to form the specific intent to murder. The length of the jury's deliberation coupled with the fact that they came back for further instructions as to the effect of intoxication, support the view that drunkenness was at least considered and support the conclusion that it is impossible to say that the verdict would have necessarily been the same had they been properly instructed that any reasonable doubt had to be given to the accused. There was substantial wrong or miscarriage.\nRinfret C.J. and Locke J. (dissenting) agreed with the unanimous judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and would have dismissed the appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, maintaining the verdict of murder found by a jury against the appellant.\nJ. T. Carvell for the appellant.\nH. W. Hickman Q.C. for the respondent. The dissenting judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. was delivered by\nLocke, J.:\u2014I respectfully agree with the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division delivered by Mr. Justice Hughes and would dismiss this appeal.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFatteux, J.:\u2014On the 6th day of March 1952, a. jury in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Queen's Bench Division) presided over by Mr. Justice W. A. I. Anglin, after four hours of deliberation, returned against the appellant a verdict of guilty\u2014to which they added \"the strongest recommendation for mercy\"\u2014on the following charge:\u2014\nThat Donald Capson, on or about the 2nd day of October A.D. 1951, at the City of Moncton, in the County of Westmorland, in the Province of New Brunswick, did unlawfully murder Rosie Wing in violation of section 263 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nThis verdict, appealed mainly on ground of misdirections on the issue of drunkenness raised at trial by the accused, was unanimously maintained by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on the view that, though some of the involved directions might be objectionable or that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence in the case would support no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred.\nLeave was thereafter granted to the appellant to appeal to this Court on two questions of law, namely:\u2014\nDid the trial Judge misdirect the jury as to the burden of proof with respect to the defence of drunkenness?\nDid the trial Judge misdirect the jury in omitting to direct them that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt upon the whole case, including the reduction of the crime of murder to manslaughter?\nThe directions in the address of the trial Judge that are attacked are:\u2014\n(1) I must direct you that if you think the accused was so intoxicated that he did not have the mind to appreciate what he was doing, then the charge of murder may be reduced to manslaughter.\n* * * (2) If he is so drunk that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt he did not know what he was doing because of the alcohol, then it is impossible for you to say that he intended to murder. So, under those circumstances, the law is that a charge of murder must then be reduced to manslaughter.\n* * *\n(3) If, however, he has drunk so much he does not know what he is doing at all and you are well satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his mind is so blurred by liquor that he does not appreciate what he is doing at all, then you are unable to find that he had any one of these intents which I will speak to you about later, so a charge of murder would have to be reduced to a finding of manslaughter.\n* * *\n(4) As I told you before, if you think that he had enough to drink that he did not know what he was doing in respect of any of these occasions when he must have a specific intent, then you may bring in a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder.\n* * *\n(5) \u2026and you have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his mind was so affected by liquor that he could not have meant to inflict grievous bodily harm to facilitate robbery, if you say it was robbery, or that he did not have the mind to intend to cause bodily injuries known to him to be likely to cause death or that he was reckless whether death ensued or not.\n* * *\n(6) But if you think that he had so much liquor during that day that his mind was not in the state of appreciating what he was doing and not just only influenced to do more readily and he would not probably have done it, if he was sober, then you may find him guilty of manslaughter.\n* * *\n(7) So that if you think, not necessarily beyond a reasonable doubt, but if you are satisfied that the influence of liquor was such that he could not appreciate what he was doing in the sense that he could not form the necessary intent to cause the death, then you may find him guilty of manslaughter instead of murder.\nWith these instructions, the jury retired and returned, two hours later, to ask the trial Judge \"to explain again the effect which the different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would have upon the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter.\" The following instructions were then given :\u2014\n(8) So in that intermediate stage you must satisfy yourselves that the accused was so much under the influence of liquor that he just could not be said to be capable or have the mental capacity to form any\nof these specific intents\u2026\n* * *\n(9) If he had so much liquor in him and his mind was so affected that you can say he did not mean to cause her death then he would be guilty of manslaughter only and not guilty of murder. It must be added that, with these conflicting instructions related to doubt on the specific issue of drunkenness, the jury were not instructed in a manner sufficiently clear that any reasonable doubt they might have on the specific issue had to be given to the accused and that the verdict should then be reduced from murder to manslaughter.\nThe jury retired again and after two more hours of further deliberation, returned to give the above verdict and recommendation for mercy.\nAppreciated in the light of well settled principles, as to the burden of proof, in the matter, it is manifest that the instructions given in this respect are confusing, incomplete and illegal. The appellant was not bound to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a condition such as incapacitating his mind of forming the pertinent specific intent essential to constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury should have been clearly instructed that the accused should only be found guilty of manslaughter if, in their view, the evidence indicated such incapacity or left them in doubt as to the matter. (See Latour v. The King 1 and authorities therein referred to).\nThe contention of the Crown that the instructions given were innocuous or were corrected is, I think, undefendable.\nThe second submission of the Crown\u2014accepted by the Court of Appeal\u2014is that there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that the appellant's mind was incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent to commit murder; consequently, says counsel for the respondent, the jury should not have been invited to consider the issue at all and even if the directions given to them, in this respect, were illegal, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted therefrom since a verdict of manslaughter could not, for the reason of drunkenness, be legally returned by the jury.\nSince there is to be a new trial, no reference will be made to the evidence.\nIn the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the appellant entered Rosie Wing's house \"probably with the idea of trying to make a loan of some money\"; but what took place from then on up to the moment at which the injuries were inflicted is not apparent in the evidence. On any view that would bring the case under the provisions of ss. (b) of s. 259 of the Criminal Code, the jury, properly instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might have had no hesitation in finding that Capson was not, on account of drunkenness, incapacitated to form the specific intent therein provided, but it cannot safely be asserted that the jury, equally properly instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found itself in doubt on the point. The very fact that, after two hours of deliberation, the jury required from the trial Judge further instructions as to \"the effect which the different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would have upon the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter\", together with the fact that, after receiving such additional instructions, they deliberated again for two more hours before bringing a verdict of murder \"with the strongest recommendation for mercy\" support the view that drunkenness to some degree was at least considered and support the conclusion that it is impossible to say that the verdict would have necessarily been the same had they been properly instructed that any reasonable doubt had to be given to the appellant. It was, therefore, necessary for the trial Judge to instruct the jury on the issue of drunkenness and to do so according to law.\nThis conclusion also disposes of the ultimate contention of the Crown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice actually resulted from the illegal manner in which the jury were instructed.\nThe appeal should be maintained and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed; new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. T. Carvell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. W. Hickman.\n1 [1951] S.C.R. 19.\n",

Waterpark v. Fennell 7 H.L.C. 650 at 678, 683; Cannon v. Villars 8 Ch. D. 415; Pettey v. Parsons [1914] 2 Ch. 653 at 667; Canada Cement Co. v. FitzGerald 53 Can. S.C.R. 263; White v. Grand Hotel [1913] Ch. 118; Todrick v. Western National Omnibus Co. [1934] 1 Ch. 191 at 206; Robinson v. Bailey [1948] 2 All E.R. 791 at 795.\nS owned two adjacent farms A and B. Lake Simcoe bounded A on the west and B bounded it on the east. S subdivided A into lots. Lot 33 adjoined B and lot 17 had served as a lane whereby access was gained to the lake from B by passing along a lane on B over lot 33 to lot 17. S sold farm B and purported to grant a \u201cperpetual right of way\u201d over lot 33 to the purchaser \u201chis heirs executors and assigns\u201d to be binding on S his \u201cheirs executors and assigns\u201d. B and lot 17 were later sold en bloc and the successor in title to this land subdivided B, laying out a road on the site of the old farm lane and, in selling lots, purported to convey a right of way over lot 33.\nHeld: On the construction of the grant in the light of the authorities that 1. The dominant tenement intended by the parties was the farm B and not lot 17. 2. The existence of the farm lane over lot 33 between the gates on the farm and lot 17 and the non-user in connection with the farm of any other part of lot 33 indicated that the way granted was over the existing farm lane and the width of the way was limited to the width of the farm gate for the purpose of access from the farm gate to the gate on eastern boundary of lot 17. 3. As it could not be said it was within the contemplation of the parties that the farm would always remain a farm, there was nothing to restrict the plain words of the grant to the use being made of the farm lane at that time, and further, that upon the severance of the dominant tenement into several parts, the easement attached to those parts. Codling v. Johnson 9 B. & C. 934; Newcomen v. Coulson 5 Ch. D. 141.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario [1951] O.R. 504, reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal[1], reversing a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C.[2], declaring that no right of way existed on certain land. G.N. Shaver Q.C., F.W. Bartrem Q.C. and G.M. Paulin, for the appellant.\nN.L. Matthews Q.C., Beatrice E. Lyons and G.W. Gorrell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK, J.:\u2014The appellant is the owner of lots 18, 19 and 33 on registered plan 103 which fronts on the easterly side of a road known as the Lake Shore Road skirting the easterly shore of Lake Simcoe in the Province of Ontario. The respondent is the owner of lots on plan 320 which adjoins plan 103 to the east. Plan 103 consists of thirty-two lots, numbering from south to north, fronting on the east side of the Lake Shore Road, and also a long narrow lot, number 33, which adjoins the easterly limits of the other lots and fronts on the north limit of a road called the Mahoney Side Road which, in turn, runs east and west to the Lake Shore Road along the southerly limits of the two plans. Lots 1 to 32 are fifty feet in width, while lot 33 is thirty feet. The attached sketch sufficiently indicates the situation.\nWhen plan 103 was registered in or about the year 1910, the lands covered by both plans, as well as other land to the east, were owned by one O.B. Sheppard, the lands now covered by plan 320 and the land to the east being in the occupation of a tenant, John T. Smith, who was engaged in farming operations thereon. Subsequently, Sheppard conveyed the farm to Smith and his wife as joint tenants.\nThe farm fronted on the north side of the Mahoney Side Road, but there had been in use for some time prior to the conveyance to the Smiths a farm lane running in an easterly and westerly direction from the farm buildings located some distance north of the side road, across the farm, over lot 33 to lot 17, plan 103, and thence to the Lake Shore Road. This lane was used as a means of access to and from the farm buildings.\nThe farm was fenced off from plan 103 by a wire fence running along the easterly boundary of lot 33, the only opening in it being a gate opposite lot 17 where the farm lane met the east limit of lot 33. There was also a gate opposite in the east limit of lot 17, while there was another gate in the west limit of lot 17 where the lane entered Lake Shore Road.\nLots on plan 103 were from time to time disposed of by Sheppard, usually together with a right-of-way over lot 33. Sheppard conveyed lot 17 on September 9, 1924, to one Lascelles, reserving to himself a right-of-way over the entire lot \u201cfor all purposes and at all times.\u201d At this time Sheppard remained the owner of lot 18 immediately to the south, as well as lot 33. On November 29, 1924, Lascelles conveyed lot 17 to the Smiths, subject to the above-mentioned right-of-way. Subsequently, on September 21, 1925, Sheppard executed the following deed:\nIn consideration of the sum of one dollar the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged I hereby give to John Smith of the Township of North Gwillimbury in the County of York and Province of Ontario his heirs executors and assigns a perpetual right of way over Lot thirty-three (33) Plan one hundred and three (103) registered said Lot & Plan being in the Township of North Gwillimbury in the County of York and Province of Ontario. This is to be binding on my heirs executors or assigns.\nIn 1941 the Smith farm, as well as lot 17, plan 103, was conveyed (the latter subject to the right-of-way already mentioned) to the predecessor in title of the respondent, together with \u201ca perpetual right-of-way over lot No. 33 according to plan No. 103\u201d. The registration of plan 320 followed on March 30, 1946. This plan shows a street known as Lakeview Road overlying the site of the westerly portion of the old farm lane, but this street is sixty-six feet in width, whereas that of the lane was about fifty feet between its fences.\nThis action was commenced by the appellant to restrain the respondent and certain other owners of lots on plan 320 from entering upon lot 33, and in the alternative, from using lot 33 to any greater extent than the same was actually used prior to the year 1945. The action was tried by the Chief Justice of the High Court who held that the conveyance of 1925 from Sheppard to Smith was a personal license only, but that if it amounted to the conveyance of an easement, Smith acquired nothing more than the right to pass over the portion of lot 33 between the gates already mentioned, and for the purposes only for which the lane was in fact used at the time of the grant. The only one to appeal to the Court of Appeal was the defendant Winch. As to him, the trial judgment was set aside and the action dismissed although the Chief Justice of Ontario would have restricted Winch\u2019s right-of-way over lot 33 to that part between lot 17 and the point on the east limit of lot 33 where the gate had been.\nThe appellant seeks to restore the judgment of the learned trial judge on the ground that the conveyance of 1925 was a personal license only. In the alternative, the appellant seeks a declaration that (1) the right-of-way granted to Smith was limited to the purposes for which the lane was at that time used, and (2) that by reason of the filing of plan 320 and the sale of lots according thereto, there was such a change in the circumstances as amounted to an extinguishment of that easement.\nThe basis upon which counsel founds his argument that the conveyance of 1925 amounted to nothing more than a personal license, is that there is no dominant tenement named in the conveyance. It is therefore said that the conveyance amounts to a grant of an easement in gross, something unknown to the law, with the consequence that the grant is to be construed as a personal license only.\nIt is to be observed that in the case at bar, there is in the deed of 1925 not only no mention of a dominant tenement but, apart from the words \u201cover lot thirty-three,\u201d there is no indication as to the termini of the \u201cright-of-way\u201d granted by the instrument. The grantee of the right, John Smith, together with his wife, were owners as joint tenants, both of lot 17, plan 103, and of the farm lands to the east. To my mind, in addition to the silence of the instrument of 1925 with respect to any dominant tenement, there is also, when the terms of the grant are applied to the existing circumstances, ambiguity as to whether the right-of-way was intended to be granted over the entire length and breadth of lot 33 or over some lesser part of it only. It is to be noted that the lot extended some 700 feet north of the northerly limit of the farm lane and ended in a cul-de-sac.\nAs stated by Lord Chelmsford in Waterpark v. Fennell[3]:\nParol evidence is generally admissible to apply the words used in a deed, and to identify the property comprised within it. You cannot, indeed, show that the words were intended to include a particular piece of land, but you may prove facts from which you may collect the meaning of the words used, so as to include or exclude land, where the words are capable of either construction.\nLord Wensleydale, in the same case, at p. 683, said:\nIn the course of the long and elaborate discussion which this case underwent in the Irish Court, some observations were incidentally made which are liable to be misunderstood as to the limits within which parol evidence is receivable to explain deeds, as if it could be done only in cases of doubt\u2026 The construction of a deed is always for the Court; but, in order to apply its provisions, evidence is in every case admissible of all material facts existing at the time of the execution of the deed, so as to place the Court in the situation of the grantor.\nIn Cannon v. Villars[4], Sir George Jessel M.R. said at p. 419:\nIn construing all instruments, you must know what the facts were when the agreement was entered into.\nIn Goddard on Easements, 8th edition, p. 381, the author says that\nUnder ordinary circumstances the owner of a private right of way is entitled to enter the way at one and the same place only, and not at any other; for instance, if a way to a field runs by the side of the field, the dominant owner is not entitled to alter the position of the gate through which he has been accustomed to pass from the field to the way, and to make a new entrance at a fresh place.\nAt p. 382 the author says with respect to a way originating by express grant:\n.... if the deed is silent as to the place of entry, surrounding circumstances must be taken into consideration to throw light on the intention of the parties. In Pettey v. Parsons[5], Swinfen Eady L.J. at p. 667 said:\nIt is a question of construction in a deed granting a right of way whether the way that is granted is a way so that the grantee may open gates, or means of access to the way, at any point of his frontage, or whether it is merely a way between two points, a right to pass over the road, and is limited to the modes of access to the road existing at the date of the grant. In each case it is a question of construction.\nIn South Metropolitan Cemetery Co. v. Eden[6], the right-of-way there granted was for the benefit of the dominant tenement \u201cor any part thereof,\u201d and this was also the situation in Cooke v. Ingram[7], as well as in Pettey v. Parsons, supra. In Sketchley v. Berger[8], it was made plain by the deed that the grantee of the easement was entitled to enter at any point where the right-of-way touched his lands.\nIn Deacon v. South Eastern Railway[9], the defendant had granted to the plaintiff certain lands under a railway arch,\ntogether with a right of way to the said arch to and from Villiers Street.\nAt the date of the grant and for eight years thereafter, there was only the one way by which the plaintiff could get from the land so granted to Villiers Street, and this he used. It was held by North J. that the right-of-way being undefined by the deed, the right to define was vested in the grantor, and he having defined the way, could not thereafter open a new way and require the grantee to use it.\nIn Canada Cement Co. v. Fitzgerald[10], the respondent had conveyed part of his farm to the appellant reserving\nthe right to pass over for cattle, horses and other domestic animals for water going to and from Dry Lake.\nA well defined way across the land conveyed had been used by cattle from the plaintiff\u2019s farm in going to and returning from Dry Lake for many years before and after the grant, and it was held by this court that the fact that the location and width of the passage over the land conveyed were not defined in the deed did not render it void for uncertainty, but that the way was sufficiently established by the evidence of the existing circumstances. In the light of these authorities, I think, in the first place, that the dominant tenement intended by the parties to the deed of 1925 was the farm and not lot 17. The fact that that lot, although also owned by the Smiths, was subject to a right-of-way appurtenant to lot 33 indicates, I think, that it could not have been intended that the easement created by the instrument of 1925 was intended to be appurtenant to a lot which was, at that time at least, sterile so far as building upon it was concerned.\nIn the second place, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice for Ontario, the right-of-way granted was \u201ca\u201d right-of-way, and the situation existing at the time, namely, the existence of the farm lane over that part of lot 33 between the gates and the non-user in connection with the farm of any other part of lot 33 indicates, in my opinion, that the way granted was over the site of the existing farm lane. I think this conclusion is very strongly reinforced by the existence of the fence along the entire easterly limit of lot 33, which indicates clearly that the only place of entry upon lot 33 from the farm which the grantee was intended to have was at the gate in the easterly boundary of the lot. It follows that the width of the way was limted to the width of such gate. In admitting that he had no other point of access to lot 33 from plan 320, I think the respondent was well advised.\nThe words \u201cover lot thirty-three\u201d are just as capable of referring to that part of the lot north of the old lane as to that part of the lot to the south. It is not suggested that Smiths had ever made use of the northerly part of the lot or that its use could have been of benefit to the farm. Similarly, with respect to any user by the Smiths of the southerly part of the lot, I think, with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, there is no evidence of such user. The only suggestion is that contained in the following evidence of an adopted daughter of Smith who had lived with him on the farm. She testified as to the use of the farm lane to and from the Lake Shore Road, and then gave the following evidence in answer to a leading question as to the use of lot 33 down to the side road:\nQ. Did you ever have any occasion to travel on Lot 33 down to what was known as the Mahoney Side Road at that time?\nA. Yes, I have travelled down there. Q. Did any other people use it in that way?\nA. Anyone that wanted to, used it \u2026 anyone that I know of.\nSuch evidence does not, in my opinion, indicate any user in connection with the farm or justify a conclusion that the parties to the conveyance of 1925 had reference to anything more than the one right-of-way over lot 33 for the purpose of connecting the western gate of the lane on the farm with the eastern gate of the lane on lot 17. The farm fronted on the side road and thus communicated with it directly. The lane was a means of communication between the farm buildings and the Lake Shore Road. There was little or no utility so far as the farm was concerned, in going to or from the farm buildings to the side road by means of lot 33.\nWith respect to the nature and extent of the easement granted, it is to be observed that the grant is one of a right-of-way simpliciter with no express restriction as to use. Just as the circumstances existing at the time of the grant may be looked at for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the dominant tenement and as to the location and termini of the way, the circumstances may also be looked at for the purpose of construing the conveyance as to the nature and extent of the rights conveyed.\nIn White v. Grand Hotel[11], while the easement there in question was the subject of an express grant, there was no documentary evidence of its exact terms. The action was by the owner of the servient tenement to limit the user of the way, the dominant tenement having been changed from a private residence, at the time of the grant, to a hotel. It was held, that there being no limitation to be found in the grant in the nature of the width of the right-of-way or anything of that kind, full effect must be given to the grant and the way could not be restricted to such use as existed at the time of its execution. Hamilton L.J., as he then was, pointed out that the dominant tenement, although used as a private dwelling house at the time of the grant, might be, with the consent of a third person, as in fact it had been, turned into a house which could be used for the purpose of trade. The decision on this point was upheld by the House of Lords. In South Eastern Railway Co. v. Cooper[12], Warrington L.J. used the following language at p. 226:\nThere is no question that if this were a grant of a way from one person to another, the grantee would be entitled to use it for any purpose without reference to the purpose for which the dominant tenement was used at the date of the grant, and notwithstanding that the burden on the servient tenement was thereby increased.\nIn Todrick v. Western National Omnibus Co.[13], Farwell L.J. at the trial said, at p. 206:\nIn considering whether a particular use of a right of this kind is a proper use or not, I am entitled to take into consideration the circumstances of the case, the situation of the parties and the situation of the land at the time when the grant was made: see United Land Co. v. Great Eastern Ry. Co.[14], and in my judgment a grant for all purposes means for all purposes having regard to the considerations which I have already mentioned.\nIt was held by the Court of Appeal in Todrick\u2019s case[15] that having regard to the width of the land over which the right-of-way there in question was granted, it was not within the intention of the parties to the grant that it should be used for heavy omnibus traffic.\nIn Robinson v. Bailey[16], Lord Greene M.R. referred to the language of Farwell L.J. in Todrick\u2019s case, supra, and said at p. 795:\nWhile not in any way dissenting from that statement as a general proposition, I would like to give this word of caution, that it is a principle which must not be allowed to carry the court blindly. Obviously the question of the scope of the right of way expressed in a grant or reservation is prima facie a question of construction of the words used. If those words are susceptible of being cut down by some implication from surrounding circumstances, it being, to construe them properly, necessary to look at the surrounding circumstances, of course they would be cut down. Todrick\u2019s case is a very good example of the sort of application of the rule which Farwell J. was enunciating.\nIn Robinson\u2019s case the court found that there was no limitation upon the language of the grant to be implied from the nature of the land over which the right was granted, but rather the contrary, and although the dominant tenement in question in that case was at the date of the grant subject to restrictions, those restrictions, like the situation in White\u2019s case[17], could have been gotten rid of by the consent of a third party. In the case at bar, while the Smith lands were, at the date of the grant, being used for agricultural purposes, there was no reason why they might not subsequently be subdivided into building lots as had been the case with the original part of the farm with respect to which plan 103 had been registered, and I cannot think that it is to be said that it was within the contemplation of the parties to the conveyance of 1925 that the farm would always remain a farm. I think, therefore there is nothing in the circumstances to restrict the plain words of the grant to the use being made of the farm lane at that time. Further, upon the severance of the dominant tenement into several parts, the easement attached to those parts; Codling v. Johnson[18], Newcomen v. Coulson[19].\nI would therefore allow the appeal to the extent indicated. The farm lane having been obliterated and the gates having disappeared, I would, if the parties cannot agree, direct a reference to define the location of the right-of-way.

R., 1953 1 S.C.R. 59\nDate: 1952-12-15\nVincent Feeley, Andrew Hergel, George Reid, Edward Meechan (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1952: October 27; 1952: December 15.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Common betting-house\u2014Summary trial under Part XVI\u2014Motion for non-suit\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 229, 773(f), 777(a), 1013(4) 1023(2).\nThe appellants were jointly charged with having kept a common betting-house and were tried summarily before a magistrate pursuant to ss. 773(f) and 777(a) of the Criminal Code. On a motion for nonsuit, made at the close of the case for the Crown, the charge was dismissed as against all four accused. Pursuant to s. 1013(4) of the Code, the Crown appealed the acquittal on the ground that there was evidence to support the case against the accused and the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new trial.\nHeld: (1): The appeal of the appellant Feeley should be dismissed; there was evidence which, if accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be drawn that the building in question was being used as a common betting-house; and the evidence as to the statements made by this appellant and as to his actions was such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of fact might properly have decided that he was guilty of being the keeper of such betting-house.\n(2): The appeals of the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan should be allowed and a judgment of acquittal entered, there being no evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could have found a verdict of guilty.\nHeld also, that the rules laid down in The King v. Morabito [1949] S.C.R. 172. (i) that the judicial officer presiding at the trial of a criminal charge can not dismiss the charge at the close of the case for the Crown and before the defence has elected whether or not to give evidence unless at that stage there is no evidence upon which a jury might convict, and (ii) that whether or not there is such evidence is a question of law alone, are applicable to the conduct of a trial under Part XVI of the Criminal Code.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing the Crown\u2019s appeal from the acquittal of the accused and ordering a new trial.\nW.E. MacDonald for the appellants.\nC.P. Hope Q.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.\u2014The appellants were jointly charged that they,\nwithin six months ending on the 4th day of November A.D. 1950 at the Town of New Toronto in the County of York unlawfully did keep a common betting house at the premises situate and known as Lakeside Cigar Store, 132 Sixth Street in the said Town of New Toronto, contrary to Section 229 of the Criminal Code.\nThey were tried summarily before His Worship Magistrate Hand pursuant to sections 773 (f) and 777(a) of the Criminal Code. Each of the appellants was separately represented. Upon the close of the case for the Crown on January 26, 1951, the counsel for each defendant moved \u201cfor non-suit and dismissal in respect of\u201d his client. The learned Magistrate granted this motion as to the appellants Hergel and Meechan, reserved his judgment as to the appellants Feeley and Reid and adjourned the hearing to January 29, 1951, on which date he gave judgment dismissing the charge against them also.\nThe learned Magistrate did not give extended reasons for judgment. In dealing with the motion so far as Hergel and Meechan were concerned he said \u201cI find no evidence for a conviction against Andrew Hergel and Edward Meechan and the charge against them will be dismissed.\u201d In dealing with the motion as to Feeley and Reid he simply stated that the motion would be granted and the charge dismissed.\nFrom this judgment of acquittal the Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario pursuant to section 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code on the following ground:\u2014\nThat the learned Magistrate erred in holding that there was no evidence to support the Crown\u2019s case against the accused.\nThe appeal was allowed and a new trial directed as to all four of the appellants, who now appeal to this Court pursuant to section 1023 (2) of the Code. We have not the benefit of any written reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is common ground that had the learned Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call evidence for the defence if so advised and counsel for the respondent submits that the decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito[1] establishes (i) that at that stage it was not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that whether or not there was such evidence is \u201ca question of law alone\u201d within the meaning of section 1013 (4) of the Code. I agree with this submission.\nCounsel for the appellant sought to distinguish the Morabito case from the case at bar. It is true that in the former case the trial was held under the provisions of Part XVIII of the Code and in the latter under Part XVI; and that Perry v. The King[2], approved in the judgment of Kellock J., concurred in by Rand and Locke, JJ., in the Morabito case, dealt with a charge disposed of under Part XV of the Code. It would seem, however, that Rex v. Olsen[3] also, approved in the judgment of Kellock J., dealt with a charge tried under Part XVI. The offence there charged was one on which the Crown might have proceeded either summarily or upon indictment and the fact that there was an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia indicates that the latter course had been followed. It is true that the corresponding sections in Parts XV, XVI and XVIII of the Code are not identically worded but in proceedings under each of such parts the judicial officer before whom the trial is held acts as judge both of the law and of the facts and it appears to me that the rules laid down in the Morabito case are applicable to the conduct of a trial under Part XVI of the Code. It is therefore necessary to consider as to each appellant whether at the close of the Crown\u2019s case there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted him.\nThe charge being that of keeping a common betting-house it was essential for the Crown to prove (i) that the building known as 132 Sixth Street, New Toronto, was at the relevant time a common betting-house, and (ii) that each appellant was a keeper thereof. The burden resting upon the prosecution as to (ii) above is somewhat lightened by the terms of section 229 (3) of the Criminal Code reading as follows:\u2014\n(3) Every one who appears, acts or behaves as master or mistress, or as the person having the care, government or management of any disorderly house, or as assisting in such care, government or management, shall be deemed to be the keeper thereof and is liable to be prosecuted and punished as such although in fact he or she is not the real owner or keeper thereof.\nAs in my view the order for a new trial should be upheld as to the appellant Feeley, I do not propose to discuss the evidence in detail. During the argument counsel for the Crown made it clear that he did not rely upon the presumptions created in certain circumstances by sections 985 and 986 (2) of the Criminal Code. He submitted that a prima facie case was made out against all of the appellants without the aid of these statutory presumptions.\nIn my view there was evidence which, if accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be drawn that on the 3rd of November, 1950 the building in question was being used as a common betting-house. The more difficult question is whether there was evidence that the appellants were the keepers of such betting-house.\nI have reached the conclusion that the evidence as to the statements made by the appellant Feeley, and as to his actions was such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of fact might properly have decided that he was guilty.\nAs to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan respectively counsel for the respondent relies on the following items of evidence: As to Reid: (i) the license, Exhibit 30 (ii) the fact that in the pocket of a coat hanging in a closet on the premises was \u201ca liquor permit in the name of George Reid\u201d (iii) that he was found by the police in the cellar of the store in the circumstances to be mentioned hereafter.\nAs to Hergel: (i) that on November 3,1950, he was twice seen to leave the premises in question and return (ii) the same as item (iii) in the case of Reid.\nAs to Meechan: (i) he had in his possession a key which would open the back door of the building in question and a key which would open the door of a small room in the building (ii) the same as item (iii) in the case of Reid. It will be convenient to deal first with the third item mentioned in the case of Reid as it is common to these three appellants. There was evidence that Reid, Hergel and Meechan were all found by the police in the cellar room, under the building in question, containing the oil furnace. There was evidence from which it would have been open to a jury to draw the inference that one or more of them had been burning in the furnace pieces of paper which it was open to the jury to infer were betting slips but there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that all three of them had taken part in this or from which it could be determined which one had been doing it. This being so the effect of this item is only to warrant the drawing of an inference that each of the three was present while betting slips were being destroyed. It does not warrant the drawing of the inference as to any one of them that he destroyed betting slips.\nDealing next with item (i) as to Reid, there was evidence that a document, Exhibit 30, was on the wall in the building in question. It reads as follows:\nTOWN OF NEW TORONTO No. 1 672\nTobacco\nLICENSE\nThis License is granted to Lakeside Cigar Store of 132 6th St. to carry on Business or Businesses as above mentioned in the Town of New Toronto.\nPROVIDED that the said Geo. Reid (L.C. St.) shall duly observe all By-laws made and provided by the Municipal Council of the Town of New Toronto, under which this License is Issued.\nThis License to continue in force until the 31st day of Dec. 1950 and no longer. This License may be Cancelled if the provisions of any By-law regarding the same are not fully observed.\nISSUED at the Town of New Toronto, this 1st day of February, 1950. Amount of License Fee $2.00\n(Sgd.) F.R. LONGSTAFF\nMunicipal Treasurer\nBelow this appears a cash register printing shewing $2.00 paid on February 1, 1950.\nCounsel for the appellant objects that this has no probative value in the absence of any evidence to identify the appellant George Reid with the individual intended to be described by the words \u201cGeo. Reid\u201d in the license. This point was not further developed in argument and I do not propose to discuss the numerous decisions, some of which are not easy to reconcile, in which the question has been considered as to whether and to what extent identity of name is evidence of identity of person. I will assume, without deciding, that a jury would have been entitled to infer that the appellant George Reid was the individual described by the words \u201cGeo. Reid\u201d in Exhibit 30. It might then be suggested that this indicated that on February 1, 1950, the appellant Reid was the licensee permitted to carry on business under the name \u201cLakeside Cigar Store\u201d at the premises in question and that the presence of Exhibit 30 on such premises on November 3, 1950 indicated that he had up to that date continued in charge of such business. Be this as it may, it appears to me that if such an inference could otherwise have been drawn it was displaced by the evidence given by the Crown that Feeley was both the owner and the person in charge of the premises.\nItem (ii) as to Reid seems to me to indicate nothing more than that the appellant Reid had hung up his coat in a closet in the premises in question and possessed a liquor permit. It throws no light on the question as to what he was doing on the premises.\nIn my opinion, these three items of evidence, taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case that Reid was in fact the keeper or that he appeared, acted or behaved as the person having the care, government or management of the house in question or as assisting in such care, government or management.\nIn the case of Hergel the evidence as to his presence in the cellar in the circumstances mentioned, coupled with the evidence as to his twice leaving and entering the premises, falls far short of making out a prima facie case.\nIn the case of Meechan the evidence as to his presence in the cellar and as to the possession of the two keys mentioned above does not appear to me to indicate that he was a keeper. His possession of the keys would permit the jury to infer that he had a right to enter the building and a particular room therein, but would afford no foundation for a finding that he took any part in its care, government or management. For the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that as to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan there was no evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have found a verdict of guilty.\nI would dismiss the appeal of the appellant Feeley. I would allow the appeals of the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan and direct that as to each of them a judgment of acquittal be entered.\nAppeal of the appellant Feeley dismissed; appeals of the other appellants allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.E. MacDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.P. Hope.\n[1] [1949] S.C.R. 172.\n[2] 82 Can. C.C. 240.\n[3] 4 C.R. (Can.) 65.\n",

The appellant had placed three flares, two behind and one in front of the trailer, all three at less than one hundred feet from the trailer; but these flares were extinguished at the time of the accident.\nThe action was taken by the son's mother, as administratrix of his estate, and on her own behalf and that of his father, as dependents. The trial judge, having found negligence in the failure to set out the flares in the manner prescribed by the Public Service Vehicles Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 276) and in the failure to remove the trailer from the highway or repair it, awarded damages in the sum of $6,000 under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 125) and the Trustee Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 215). This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Alberta.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed; Kellock and Locke JJ., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial restricted to the amount of damages to be awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act.\nPer Kerwin, Estey and Fauteux JJ.: Applying City of Vancouver v. Burchill [1932] S.C.R. 620 and Fuller v. Nickel [1949] S.C.R. 601, even if the appellant did put the flares out in a manner that did not comply with the statute, it was not liable in damages unless such breach was the direct cause of the accident. The statutory requirement of putting out flares in the circumstances of this case constitutes a duty the performance of which is the minimum required by law and does not relieve from exercising the care that a reasonable man would exercise in the circumstances. The collision was directly caused by the failure to exercise such care. A reasonable man would have appreciated the danger, foreseen the possibility of injury and would have made an effort to remove or repair the trailer which, upon the evidence, would have been successful. (Jones v. Shajer [1948] S.C.R. 166 distinguished).\nThe amount of damages awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act must be determined upon the particular facts in each case and, in part, must be a matter of estimate, even conjecture. Appellate Courts have, apart from some error in principle, interfered only where the damages were clearly excessive, that is to say where there was no reasonable proportion between the amount awarded and the loss sustained, which is not the case here even though the damages awarded were somewhat large.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting in part) : The fact that the flares were not placed at the distance from the stranded vehicle required by the regulations had no bearing on the occurrence of the accident since they had been extinguished before it happened. The proper inference to be drawn from the evidence was that the flares were in a defective condition when placed upon the highway and this, coupled with the negligence found by the trial judge of failing to remove the vehicle from the highway, was sufficient to sustain the finding of liability.\nNo evidence was given at the trial as to the age or the financial circumstances of the parents on whose behalf the claim for damages was made under the Fatal Accidents Act in respect of the death of an illegitimate child and the amount awarded was so excessive as to bear no reasonable relation to any loss shown to have been sustained. There should be a new trial restricted to the assessment of damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming the judgment of Shepherd J. 1, which had awarded the respondent $6,000 for damages for fatal injuries suffered by her son when his motorcycle collided with the appellant's trailer parked on the highway at night.\nA. F. Moir for the appellants.\nF. R. McLean Q.C. and F. Dunne for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Eauteux JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014William Bruno Pollock, shortly after 1:30 on the morning of August 20, 1948, riding a motorcycle northward toward Edmonton on Highway No. 2, lost his life when he collided with a heavily loaded trailer owned by the appellant Marsden Kooler Transport Limited (hereinafter called the Company) and parked on the highway. This action is brought by his mother, as administratrix of his estate, on her own behalf and that of his father William Bruno. The learned trial judge 2 awarded damages in the sum of $6,000 against both appellants and his judgment was affirmed in the Appellate Court.\nThe appellant Piche, an employee of the Company, was driving the Company's truck, with trailer attached, northward on Highway No. 2 when about 9:00 p.m., on the evening of August 19, 1948, a bearing seized in the right rear wheel of the trailer. It was impossible for him then to move the trailer further with his own truck. He, therefore, detached the truck and left this trailer, 22 feet long and 7 feet 8 inches wide, parked on the east side of the highway. The highway had a hard surface width of 22 feet, with one foot of gravel on each side. The policeman who made certain measurements found the west side of the trailer was 13 6 feet from the west edge of the hard surface. This trailer was entirely on the hard surface and every vehicle proceeding northward, of necessity, had to turn to the west in order to avoid it.\nPiche immediately communicated with another of the Company's drivers, who returned with his truck while Piche was still there, but no effort was then made, notwithstanding the presence of two of the Company's drivers and their respective trucks, to move the trailer. The learned trial judge found:\nI am satisfied from the evidence that had Piche and his fellow truck driver hooked up their two trucks to the trailer they could have removed it from the highway without difficulty shortly after it became disabled. The wrecker truck that did remove it the next morning pulled it two and a half miles in about an hour to a point where it was clear of the highway.\nPiche put out three flares, one between 30 and 50 feet north of the trailer, the second just south of the trailer and a third about 30 or 50 feet south of the trailer. These were not placed as required by the regulations made under The Public Service Vehicles Act of the Province of Alberta (R.S.A. 1942, c. 276). They remained burning until some time around midnight, but were not burning at the time of the collision. After the collision these flares were found in a damaged condition, but in places that did not assist in determining where they had been originally placed. The learned trial judge stated that after parking the trailer and placing the flares Piche then drove in his truck to Edmonton, called at his employer's warehouse and, finding it closed, went home to bed, making no other effort to get in touch with his employer until the next morning, nor did he notify the police, nor anyone else, of the presence of the trailer on the highway.\nThe trailer was, in fact, removed by another party the next morning as a result of action taken by the police.\nThe deceased had left Edmonton about midnight with two friends, each riding a motorcycle. They went to Leduc and as they passed the trailer the three flares were burning. They left Leduc to return to Edmonton about 1:30 in the morning. It was then very foggy. As they approached the trailer the flares were not burning. The deceased was riding last and it would appear that his motorcycle collided with the rear left corner of the trailer, causing him to lose his life.\nThe appellants' contention that, even if Piche did put the flares out in a manner that did not comply with the statute, the appellants are not liable in damages, as here claimed, unless such breach was the direct cause of the accident, has been repeatedly recognized. City of Vancouver v. Burchill 3 and Fuller v. Nickel et al 4. The learned trial judge appears to have been satisfied that the absence of the flares did contribute to the accident and that their absence was due to the manner in which they were placed by Piche. It was, however, unnecessary for the learned judge to make a specific finding to that effect, as he found that if Piche had exercised reasonable care the trailer would have been removed from the highway some time before the accident took place. It was on the failure in this regard that the learned judge appeared to place the greater emphasis and it was undoubtedly a direct cause of the collision.\nThis case illustrates again what has been repeatedly stated that a statutory requirement such as putting out flares constitutes a duty that must be performed and if the flares are placed with care they are often an adequate protection, at least for some time. However, the performance of that statutory obligation is the minimum required by law and does not relieve a person in Piche's position from exercising the care that a reasonable man would exercise in the circumstances. A reasonable man would have appreciated the danger caused by the presence of the trailer, foreseen the possibility of injury and would have utilized the Company's two trucks in an effort to remove the trailer which, upon the evidence, would have been successful.\nThere was another alternative. It was about 10:00 p.m. when Piche left for Edmonton. A reasonable man would not have been content merely to try the warehouse door, but would have made an effort to communicate with his employer and endeavour to arrange for either the repair, which the evidence establishes could have been made upon the highway, or removal of the trailer.\nIf either of the foregoing reasonable courses had been adopted the trailer would not have been there at the time of the collision. It was Piche's failure to exercise the care of a reasonable man in the circumstances that directly caused the collision here in question. At all material times he was acting within the scope of his employment with the appellant company.\nJones v. Shafer 5, relied upon by the appellants, is distinguishable upon its facts. There, apart from other distinguishing factors, the learned trial judge found:\nI do not think under the circumstances here that the defendant could have secured the necessary equipment to do so (that is to move the truck), at least until the next morning.\nThe flares were put out with care and were removed by some unknown person. Moreover, after the flares were so removed the police visited the vehicle there in question and lighted the lights thereon, which were burning at the time of the accident.\nThe appellants contend that the damages in the sum of $6,000 awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 125) are excessive. They draw our attention to the statement of my Lord the Chief Justice, then Rinfret J., with whom Smith J. concurred, in Littley v. Brooks et al 6:\nIn assessing damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, it is well settled law that the jury are confined to pecuniary loss sustained by the family and cannot take into consideration the mental suffering of the survivors \u2026 It is the reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage by the relatives remaining alive that may be taken into consideration. The appellants then cite a number of cases in which they contend the damages awarded were such as to indicate the damages here are excessive. The amount of damages allowed upon the above basis must be determined upon the particular facts under consideration in each case and, in part, must be a matter of estimate, even conjecture. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. of Can. v. Jennings 7. Appellate courts have, apart from some error in principle, interfered only where the damages are clearly excessive. Our attention was directed to Taff Vale Ry. v. Jenkins 8, where damages were fixed by a jury under The Fatal Accidents Act. It was contended in the House of Lords that the damages were excessive. Lord Atkinson stated that in such a case an appellate court would regard the damages as excessive only where \"the Court cannot find any reasonable proportion between the amount awarded and the loss sustained.\" In Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld. 9, Lord Wright stated:\nWhere the verdict is that of a jury, it will only be set aside if the appellate court is satisfied that the verdict on damages is such that it is out of all proportion to the circumstances of the case: Mechanical and General Inventions Co., Ld. v. Austin, 1935 A.C. 346. Where, however, the award is that of the judge alone, the appeal is by way of rehearing on damages as on all other issues, but as there is generally so much room for individual choice so that the assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion than an ordinary act of decision, the appellate court is particularly slow to reverse the trial judge on a question of the amount of damages. It is difficult to lay down any precise rule which will cover all cases, but a good general guide is given by Greer L.J. in Flint v. Lovell, 1935\u20141 KB. 354, 360.\nThe statement of Lord Justice Greer 10 referred to reads as follows:\nIn order to justify reversing the trial judge on the question of the amount of damages it will generally be necessary that this Court should be convinced either that the judge acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that the amount awarded was so extremely high or so very small as to make it, in the judgment of this Court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled.\nOn the foregoing basis, even if one were disposed to conclude that the damages were somewhat large, there is no basis here disclosed upon which an appellate court should interfere.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Kellock, J. (dissenting in part)\u2014In my opinion, this appeal should succeed as to damages only. At the time of the accident, the deceased was within a few weeks of being seventeen years old. He was a normal, healthy boy, and the family was apparently in humble circumstances. The boy had been engaged in helping his father in his business of trucking, being paid a wage of $60 a month, out of which he was paying $7 a week to his mother for board. The father testified that a few months after his son's death he took in another man on a partnership basis, he himself retaining a 75 per cent interest, and that this arrangement cost him from $60 to $70 a month more than he had been paying his deceased son. There is nothing in this evidence, however, which suggests that either the father or the son during the latter's lifetime realized that the boy was being under-paid or that he was making a contribution to his father. He occasionally bought, as the father said, \"odd little things, a present, some small thing\" for his sister \"that didn't amount to much.\"\nThe contention of the respondent that the deceased \"was in a rather different position from so many others of his age due to the fact that here was not only an expectation of contribution insofar as the dependents were concerned, but an actual contribution of $50 to $60 per month through his work with his father,\" is therefore not borne out by the evidence.\nIt is, of course, quite unnecessary in a case of this kind that, in order to establish a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit, the deceased should have in fact contributed to the support of the plaintiff, but, to employ the language of Lord Atkinson in Taff Vale Railway Company v. Jenkins 11, the court must find a \"reasonable proportion between the amount awarded and the loss sustained.\"\nIn my opinion, there is on the evidence in this case no reasonable relation between the amount awarded and the loss sustained. I therefore concur in the order proposed by my brother Locke. Locke, J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which dismissed the appeal of the present appellants from a judgment for damages awarded against them under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act (c. 125, R.S.A. 1942) and the Trustee Act (c. 215, R.S.A. 1942).\nIn view of the nature of the findings of negligence made at the trial, it is desirable to state the facts proven in some detail. The appellant Piche, a truck driver employed by the appellant company, was on the evening of August 19, 1948, driving a three ton tractor drawing a vehicle described as a semi-trailer upon the main highway from Calgary to Edmonton. At about 8 o'clock, when he was north of Leduc, trouble developed in one of the housings of the trailer, the bearings being smashed or seized, whereupon he drew over to the right side of the pavement and stopped and, deciding that he would be unable to proceed without assistance, sent word to the driver of another truck of the respondent company which was preceding him to the north asking him to return and assist him. When the driver of the second truck joined him, Piche decided to put out flares on the highway to give warning of the presence of the trailer, to disconnect that vehicle from the tractor and leave it standing on the highway. Having done this, he proceeded to Edmonton and, after going to the appellant company's warehouse to report and finding it closed, went to his home and retired to bed.\nThe highway at the place in question has a hard surface twenty-two feet wide: the trailer was twenty-two feet long and seven feet eight inches wide and, according to a constable who gave evidence on the respondent's behalf, the left side of the vehicle was thirteen feet six inches distant from the west side of the pavement, thus being well to the east of the center line The right wheels of the trailer were close to the easterly edge of the pavement. While the trailer was equipped with the clearance lights required by the Vehicles and Highways Traffic Act (c. 275, R.S.A. 1942), these were supplied with electricity from the tractor and were extinguished when the latter unit was disconnected.\nThe boy William Bruno Pollock in respect of whose death damages were claimed had that evening ridden, in company with two companions named Fricker and McMinn from Edmonton South to Leduc. Each of them was riding on a motorcycle. They had passed the trailer on their way south, at which time, according to Fricker, there were three flares on the roadway, one to the north and two to the south of the trailer. After spending a short time at Leduc, McMinn started north for Edmonton and was followed a short time after by the others. Pollock who had left with Flicker apparently got behind and was riding alone at the time the accident occurred. According to Flicker, it had become very foggy and before he reached the place where the trailer was standing he had lost sight of Pollock. As he approached the trailer there were no flares to be seen: having passed it he proceeded north. Pollock meanwhile followed Fricker along the highway and, failing to detect the presence of the trailer, collided with the left rear of the vehicle suffering injuries which caused his death before anyone reached the scene of the accident.\nThe claim of the respondents as pleaded is in negligence. While, as stated in the reasons for judgment of Shepherd, J. 12, he permitted an amendment at the trial to set up a claim in nuisance he made no finding on that issue. He found Piche to have been negligent in failing to set out the flares in the manner required by regulations made under the provisions of the Public Service Vehicles Act (c. 276, R.S.A. 1942) and in failing to remove the trailer from the highway which, he considered, could have been accomplished with the assistance of the other truck of the appellant company. The learned trial judge also expressed the view that as the trailer could have been repaired on the highway by taking out repairs from Edmonton this should have been done.\nThe regulations relating to the setting out of warning lights passed under the provisions of the Public Service Vehicles Act read as follows:\u2014\nWhen during the period between sunset and sunrise or any other time when things are not plainly visible at a distance of 500 feet a Public Service or Commercial Vehicle becomes stationery for any reason whatever upon any highway outside the boundaries of a city, town or village, and\n(a) the lighting equipment required by The Public Service Vehicles Act and\/or The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act is disabled, the driver or other person in charge of such vehicle shall immediately cause two red lanterns, fusees, flares or approved reflectors to be placed on the highway in line with the vehicle, one at a distance of approximately one hundred (100) feet in front of the vehicle and one at a distance of approximately one hundred feet at the rear of the vehicle.\n(b) the lighting equipment is not disabled, the driver or person in charge of such vehicle shall after a period not exceeding ten (10) minutes, proceed to set out flares, lamps, lanterns, reflectors, or fusees as provided for above.\nIn dealing with this aspect of the matter the learned trial judge said in part :\u2014\nIn fixing the distance of approximately 100 feet at which flares must be set out under circumstances such as we have here it is presumed that this distance of approximately 100 feet is the minimum required for safety but in this case the flares were at the most placed not more than 50 ft. from the parked trailer. This surely was negligence on the part of Piche for which he and his employer, the other defendant, must be held responsible.\nIt was, however, not the fact that the flares were put out less than one hundred feet from the vehicle that caused or contributed to the occurrence of the accident but the fact that they were extinguished when Pollock arrived there on his return journey. Unless, therefore, as contended for the respondent, the placing of the flares on the highway at less than the prescribed distance from the vehicle was a contributing factor to their being extinguished by passing vehicles striking them, the fact that this was done is an irrelevant circumstance.\nThe flares in question were described by Piche as being round pot flares burning kerosene and having a screw top wick in them and they were, according to him, in good condition and full of oil. Constable McLean of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that they were the usual type used for this purpose and he considered them to be standard equipment. According to Piche, he had placed one flare on the highway to the east of the center line about twenty paces to the north of the trailer, a second one close to the back of it and a third some twenty paces to the south of it. This witness had said at the coroner's inquest that he had placed the flares thirty feet to the north and to the south of the trailer and this discrepancy in his evidence is commented on adversely by the learned trial judge. With respect, however, I think it can make no difference in considering what caused the flares to be extinguished whether the one to the north and the one farthest to the south were thirty feet or fifty feet (estimating a pace as Piche did as two and a half feet) from the trailer. As to the distance such flares are visible, Holcombe, an experienced bus driver employed by the Western Canadian Greyhound Lines and who passed the trailer in the early morning hours of August 20 when it was very foggy, said that they were visible at a distance of three hundred yards and that the vehicle itself was visible when he was about seventy-five yards distant. Engel, an experienced driver, said that he could see such flares in a fog in ample time to stop: if it was really foggy he considered they could be seen from one hundred to two hundred feet distant. Fricker, who said that there was fog as he described it \"in patches\" when they passed the trailer going south, stated that at that time the flares could be seen a quarter of a mile away. There is no contradiction of this evidence in the record. Constable McLean said that flares of this type when set out at night were very good as warning signals, but he was unable from any experience to say how effective they were in a fog.\nIn endeavouring to come to a conclusion as to what caused the flares to be extinguished, it is of importance to consider the condition and the various locations in which they were found after the accident. Constable McLean found one of the flares about twenty feet south of the trailer on the east side of the highway. The wick had been knocked out and the container was damaged. He also found one about twenty or thirty feet to the north of the trailer in the ditch on the west side of the highway. A third flare was seen by the witness Holcombe between the rear wheels and under the back of the trailer which, he said, had been \"up ended.\" Constable McLean found a skid mark on the highway commencing forty-eight feet south of the van and leading to the left rear corner which, in his opinion, had undoubtedly been caused by Pollock's motorcycle. Holcombe who said that one of the flares was burning at a point some forty to fifty feet south of the trailer when he passed that vehicle going south, said that it had apparently been hit by some vehicle at about the point where the skidmark commenced and coal oil was spilled on the highway. The evidence of both of these witnesses, it may be noted, supports Piche's statement that he had placed the most southerly flare about twenty paces or fifty feet distant from the trailer.\nSince it was proven as part of the plaintiff's case that the flares were out at the time of the accident, the only reasonable inference to draw from this evidence is, in my opinion, that the most southerly flare was struck by Pollock's motorcycle and the one placed immediately to the south of the vehicle also struck as it skidded towards the rear of the van. As to the flare which had been placed to the north of the trailer, in view of the evidence of the visibility of such flares, the proper inference is, I think, that after it had ceased to burn it had been struck and knocked to the side by some passing vehicle. Nothing in any of this evidence, in the view I take of this matter, supports the idea that the distance at which they were placed from the vehicle had any bearing on their being extinguished. The finding of liability based upon an infringement of the regulations cannot, therefore, be supported.\nThe second ground of negligence found was that the trailer could, without difficulty, have been removed from the highway within a short time after it became disabled as the equipment to do so was available. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that if Piche and his fellow truck driver had hooked up their two trucks to the trailer they could have removed it from the highway without difficulty shortly after it became disabled. There was conflicting evidence upon this point. While the evidence of Engel, the driver of the powerful wrecker sent to the scene, would indicate the contrary, the admissions made by Piche on cross-examination that while he considered it would have injured the axle of the vehicle the two tractors could have moved the trailer off the highway were accepted by the learned trial judge. It was shown that very close to the place where the trailer was halted there was a roadway leading into an elevator to which the trailer might have been moved and the possibility of danger to passing traffic avoided. It is to be remembered that while this large trailer was equipped with clearance lights which would have served as an additional warning to traffic upon the highway these were extinguished, of necessity, when the tractor was disconnected. Flares of the required type if in condition should, upon the evidence, have burned throughout the night and the fact that these flares went out in the circumstances above detailed is consistent only, in my opinion, with the fact that they were in a defective condition when they were placed upon the highway. It was the duty of the appellants, I think, since they proposed to leave the vehicle standing upon the highway to see that the flares set out were in proper condition to continue burning throughout the hours of darkness, particularly in view of the absence of any other lights upon the vehicle. These circumstances, together with the negligence found by the learned judge, suffice, in my opinion, to sustain a finding of liability on the part of the appellants.\nIt is further argued for the appellants that the cause of the accident was the negligence of Pollock and, alternatively, that he was guilty of negligence which contributed to the occurrence. On these issues the learned trial judge has found for the respondent and the Appellate Division has dismissed the appeal from this finding. The argument addressed to us has not satisfied me that there has been any error in dealing with this aspect of the case.\nThe appellants contend further that the damages awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act are excessive and bear no reasonable relation to the actual financial loss suffered by the parents of the deceased. The respondent Annie Pollock is the mother of the deceased boy who was born out of wedlock: the father William Bruno and the respondent, it appears, have lived together for about twenty years and there is another child of which they are the parents who was seven years old at the time of the trial. While unmarried they have maintained a home together and the boy lived with them and went to school until he was fourteen years old, after which he worked for his father in his business of trucking and dealing in scrap metal. The father was paying his son $60 a month for his services and the boy paid $7 a week to his mother for board. Had he lived he would have attained the age of seventeen years on September 6, 1948. Neither the age of the father or the mother was proven and no evidence given as to the financial circumstances of either of them. According to William Bruno, it would have cost him $120 a month for a man to replace his son as his assistant in carrying on his business at the date of the trial which was December 19, 1950, more than two years after the time of the accident. It was also shown that at times the boy used to buy small presents for his mother and for the little girl. He was a strong healthy lad and had had nothing other than minor illnesses during his life.\nUpon this evidence the learned trial judge awarded damages under the Fatal Accidents Act of $6,000. The learned Chief Justice of Alberta, in delivering the judgment of the Court, said as to this:\u2014\nWhile we might not have awarded so large a sum under the Fatal Accidents Act, we are not prepared to find that the trial judge assessment under that Act did not bear a reasonable proportion to the loss sustained.\nThe principles which govern awards under statutes of this nature have long since been settled. In my opinion, they cannot be more concisely and accurately stated than in the following passage from the judgment of Killam, C.J. in Davidson v. Stuart 13:\nThe damages are not to be allowed for injury to the feelings of the survivors, but for the loss of a life of substantial pecuniary value to the relatives entitled under the statute; there must be evidence reasonably warranting the inference that the relatives have sustained a loss of that character. It need not appear that the deceased was under any legal liability to the survivors of which his death has prevented performance; it is sufficient that the circumstances were such as should give them a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuance of the life.\nSection 2 of the Fatal Accidents Act provides that the expression \"child\" in the statute shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include an illegitimate child: but for this there would have been no claim by either parent (Town of Montreal West v. Hough 14). In addition to the damages claimed under the provisions of that Act the plaintiff claimed under the provisions of the Trustee Act and the learned trial judge awarded a sum of $1,000 which, we were informed by counsel for both parties, was for loss of life expectancy, and the sum of $340 for funeral expenses. The deceased boy left other estate to the amount of $750 which amount, together with the damages awarded under the Trustee Act, go to the mother under the provisions of the Intestate Successions Act (c. 211, R.S.A. 1942), the net amount so received being $1,750. From the damages awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act it was directed that this amount be deducted, leaving a sum of $4,250 to be divided equally between the father and the mother.\nThe onus lay upon the plaintiff in the present matter to establish that those on whose behalf the claim was advanced had a reasonable expectancy of pecuniary benefit from the continued life of Pollock and this, in my opinion, was done in so far as the claim was made on behalf of the mother and the father. It was, however, further the obligation of the plaintiff to prove the facts from which a fair estimate of the damage sustained could be made. The fact that at a time two years after the event the father was required to pay a man $60 a month more than the amount he had paid to his son does not, of course, establish a loss in any such amount. The period when this was done was two years later when all wage earners were being paid increased amounts and a full grown man would presumably be able to do more and effective work than a boy of seventeen. The boy had gone to work when taken out of school and, while it is perhaps fair to assume that for some time he would work for his father for less than he could obtain elsewhere, in the normal course of events within two or three years he would either establish himself elsewhere or expect the same wages as other men for the work done. It is not necessary in claims under the Act that it should be shown that the person on whose behalf the claim is made has a claim in law to maintenance or assistance but the fact that this boy was illegitimate is, in my opinion, a factor which must be considered in dealing with the claim advanced on behalf of his father. The age of the parents and the financial circumstances of each of them were also material facts to be considered in estimating what value should be attributed to the support which the father and mother might reasonably expect to receive from their son in the future and neither point was touched in the evidence.\nThe question of the quantum of the award under the Fatal Accidents Act is to be considered as standing by itself. The evidence is, in my opinion, inadequate to enable the Court to properly estimate the amount of the loss sustained by the boy's death. Upon the evidence as it stands, I think the amount of $6,000 is so excessive as to bear no reasonable relation to such loss as was shown to have been sustained.\nIn these circumstances, I think there should be a new trial restricted, however, to the amount of damages to be awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act. As the appeal should otherwise fail, in my opinion, and success thus be divided between the parties I think there should be no costs either in this Court or in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wood, Buchanan, Campbell, Moir & Hope.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Maclean & Dunne.\n1 [1951] 3 W.W.R.

The By-Law provides that the City Clerk \u201cmay, on the recommendation of the Property and Licence Committee, issue\u201d extension permits and emergency (without defining that word) permits to authorize the service stations named therein to remain open during stated hours; it also provides that such permits be issued to stated percentages of the total number of gasoline shops \u201caccording to the records of the City Clerk\u201d in rotation; it further provides that the Clerk shall omit from the list of those entitled to extension and emergency permits such occupiers as have \u201caccording to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk\u201d failed to keep their shops open as authorized.\nThe appellant\u2019s conviction by a justice of the peace of a breach of the by-law was affirmed by a judge of the County Court and by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The conviction was attacked on the ground that the by-law was invalid because, inter alia, the council have delegated the legislative power conferred upon them with regard to the issue of extension permits and emergency service permits to the City Clerk and have substituted his judgment and discretion for their own.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed and the conviction affirmed.\nPer Kerwin, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The submission that as the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d is used in s. 5 of the by-law Council have left it to the City Clerk to decide whether permits shall be issued at all, failed; the by-law must be read and construed as a whole and it is obvious from other provisions that the Clerk must issue permits in the manner laid down in the by-law.\nThe provisions in ss. 7(2) and 8(2), that such occupiers as \u201caccording to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk\u201d have failed to keep their shops open as authorized, are invalid. It is within the powers of the Council to prescribe a state of facts the existence of which shall render an occupier ineligible to receive a permit for a stated time; but express words in the enabling Statute would be necessary to give the Council power to confer on an individual the right to decide, on such evidence as he might find sufficient, whether or not the prescribed state of facts exists and there are no such words. However, these provisions are severable.\nThe submission that there is an unauthorized delegation to the Clerk of the discretionary right to decide as to the groups provided for in ss. 7 and 8 of the by-law and as to the order of rotation as between such groups, failed. The conferring of these powers on the Clerk was within the authority given to the Council by s. 82a of the enabling Statute, \u201c\u2026any by-law\u2026 may\u2026 (c) provide for the issuing of permits\u201d. The Council has provided in the by-law with sufficient particularity for the issuing of permits and the duties imposed upon the Clerk to select the occupiers to make up the respective groups and to arrange the order of rotation, are administrative and validly imposed.\nFinally, the failure to define the word \u201cemergency\u201d did not invalidate the by-law for uncertainty.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting):\u2014With respect to the determination of membership in the percentage groups, there was an infringment of the general requirement that no part of the legislative action or discretion reposed by the Legislature in a council could be delegated to any other body or person. In view of all the factors to be considered as to the mode of selection and order, it cannot foe said that the judgment of the Council is interchangeable with that of a committee. If under a provision of the by-law, the recommendation of the committee had been placed before the Council and approved, the objection would have been met.\n(As to the other submissions, Rand J. agreed with the majority).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant for breach of a municipal by-law.\nJ.A. Sweet, Q.C. for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup Q.C. and J.S. Boeckh for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought by special leave, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the learned County Court Judge which in turn had dismissed an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a charge of breach of a by-law of the City of Hamilton respecting the closing of gasoline service stations during certain hours.\nIn the courts below and in this court the sole ground on which the conviction was attacked was that the by-law in question is invalid. The by-law purports to be passed under the authority conferred upon the Council by section 82(3) and section 82(a) of The Factory, Shop and Office Building Act. These sections read as follows:\u2014\n82(3) The council of a city, town or village may by by-law require that during the whole or any part or parts of the year all or any class or classes of shops within the municipality shall be closed, and remain closed on each or any day of the week at and during any time or hours between seven of the clock in the afternoon of any day and five of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day, but no such by-law shall be deemed to apply to the sale of fresh fruit.\n82a. In addition to any matter authorized by section 82, any by-law thereunder applicable to retail gasoline service stations, gasoline pumps and outlets in the retail gasoline service industry as defined in The Industrial Standards Act may,\u2014\n(a) provide that the by-law shall apply only in the portion or portions of the municipality designated in the by-law;\n(b) require that during the whole or any part or pants of the year such retail gasoline service stations, gasoline pumps and outlets be closed and remain closed at and during any time or hours between six of the clock in the afternoon of any day and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day and between six of the clock in the afternoon of Saturday and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following Monday; and\n(c) provide for the issuing of permits authorizing the retail gasoline service station, gasoline pump or outlet for which it is issued to be and remain open, notwithstanding the by-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit.\nThe portions of the by-law relevant to the questions raised on this appeal are sections 4 to 9 inclusive reading as follows:\u2014\nClosing Hours\n4. During the whole of the year, all gasoline shops shall, save as hereinafter in this By\u2011law otherwise provided, be closed and remain closed:\u2014\n(a) Between seven of the clock in the afternoon of each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, respectively and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day; and\n(b) Between seven of the clock in the afternoon of each Saturday and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following Monday.\nPermits to Stay Open\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4 hereof the City Clerk, may, on the recommendation of the Property and Licence Committee, issue permits authorizing those gasoline shops for which such permits are issued, to be and remain open, notwithstanding the By-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit. Idem\n6. Each said permit issued shall be either:\u2014\n(1) An Extension Permit, which shall authorize the gasoline shop for which it is issued to be and remain open, notwithstanding the By-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit, which,\n(a) In that part of the year from the first day of May until the last day of October, inclusive, shall be during the hours between seven of the clock in the afternoon and ten of the clock in the afternoon of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the week for which the permit is issued, and during the hours between ten of the clock in the forenoon of the preceding Sunday and seven of the clock in the afternoon of the said Sunday; and\n(b) In those parts of the year from the first day of November in each year until the last day of April in the following calendar year, inclusive, shall be during the hours between ten of the clock in the forenoon and five of the clock in the afternoon of the Sunday for which the permit is issued; or\n(2) An Emergency Service Permit, which shall authorize the gasoline shop for which it is isued to be and remain open for emergency service only, notwithstanding the By-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit, which, throughout the year, shall be during those hours on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday of the week for which the permit is issued, commencing at twelve of the clock in the afternoon of the preceding Saturday, when the gasoline shop for which the permit is issued would otherwise be required by the provisions of this By-law to be and remain closed.\nProportion of Extension Permits\n7. (1) Extension Permits issued pursuant to the provisions of sub-clause (1) of Section 6 shall, for each week or for each Sunday as the case may be, be issued in such number as most nearly approximates twenty-five per centum of the total number of gasoline shops in the city, according to the records of the City Clerk, and shall be issued in rotation to those occupiers of gasoline shops who are entitled to Extension Permits as hereinafter provided, so that each shall receive at least one such Extension Permit in each calendar month;\n(2) The occupiers of all gasoline shops in the City shall be entitled to Extension Permits, except those occupiers who, according to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk, have failed to keep their gasoline shops open during the whole of the time or times so authorized by such permits, on more than three days or on more than one Sunday in the current calendar year, in which case the City Clerk shall, for the balance of the calendar year or for three months, whichever is the longer period, omit every such occupier from the list of those entitled to receive Extension Permits.\nProportion of Emergency Service Permits\n8. (1) Emergency Service Permits issued pursuant to the provisions of sub-clause (2) of section 6 shall, for each week, be issued in such number as most nearly approximates five per centum of the total number of gasoline shops in the city, according to the records of the City Clerk, and shall be issued in rotation to those occupiers of gasoline shops who are entitled to Emergency Service Permits as hereinafter provided; (2) The occupiers of all those gasoline shops in the city shall be entitled to Emergency Service Permits, who file notice in writing with the City Clerk that they wish to receive the same, except those occupiers who, according to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk, have failed to keep their gasoline shops open for emergency service only during the whole of the time or times so authorized by such permits, on more than three days in the current calendar year in which case the City Clerk shall, for the balance of the calendar year or for three months, whichever is the longer period, omit every such occupier from the list of those entitled to receive Emergency Service Permits.\nSchemes of Rotation\n9. Schemes of rotation of Extension Permits or of Emergency Service Permits or both, submitted by the majority of occupiers of gasoline shops in the City of Hamilton may be considered by the Property and License Committee in coming to a decision for recommending issuance of such Extension Permits or Emergency Service Permits or both.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that no power to pass the by-law in question could be derived from section 82a, quoted above, as that section uses the words \u201c\u2026in the retail gasoline service industry as defined in the Industrial Standards Act\u201d and while section 82a came into force on March 31, 1948, the amendment to the Industrial Standards Act which defined \u201cretail gasoline service industry\u201d did not come into force until May 1, 1948. It is not necessary to consider what weight this argument would have had in regard to the validity of a by-law passed pursuant to section 82a between March 31, 1948 and May 1, 1948. In my opinion, it became untenable after May 1, 1948, and the by-law with which we are concerned was passed on October 25, 1948.\nCounsel for the appellant argues that the by-law is bad on the ground that the council in the provisions dealing with the issue of extension permits and emergency service permits have delegated to the City Clerk the legislative power conferred upon them and have substituted his judgment and discretion for their own.\nIn support of this it is first submitted that as the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d is used in section 5 of the by-law Council have left it to the City Clerk to decide whether permits shall be issued at all; but the by-law must, of course, be read and construed as a whole and it is obvious from other provisions that the Clerk must issue permits in the manner laid down in the by-law. It is only necessary to refer by way of example to the opening words of sections 7(2) and 8(2);\u2014\n7 (2) The occupiers of all gasoline shops shall be entitled to Extension Permits.\n8 (2) The occupiers of all those gasoline shops in the city shall be entitled to Emergency Service Permits, who file notice\u2026\nIt is next submitted that the provisions in sections 7(2) and 8(2) of the by-law that the clerk shall omit from the list of those entitled to permits such occupiers as have \u201caccording to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk\u201d failed to keep their shops open as authorized, are invalid. With this submission I agree. It is within the powers of the Council to prescribe a state of facts the existence of which shall render an occupier ineligible to receive a permit for a stated time; but express words in the enabling Statute would be necessary to give the Council power to confer on an individual the right to decide, on such evidence as he might find sufficient, whether or not the prescribed state of facts exists and there are no such words. In my opinion, however, these provisions are severable and if the by-law is otherwise valid it may stand with the words quoted above in this paragraph deleted from sections 7(2) and 8(2).\nIt is next submitted that there is an unauthorized delegation to the City Clerk of the discretionary right to decide (i) which occupiers shall compose the groups most nearly approximating twenty-five per centum of the total number of gasoline shops (under section 7) and most nearly approximating five per centum of such total (under section 8) and (ii) the order of rotation as between such groups. I am unable to agree with this submission. In my opinion the conferring of these powers on the City Clerk is within the authority given to the Council by the words of section 82a of the enabling Statute, \u201c\u2026any by-law\u2026 may\u2026 (c) provide for the issuing of permits\u201d. The Council has laid down in the by-law (i) the times during which the permits shall authorize occupiers of gasoline shops to remain open (ii) the proportion of total occupiers who shall make up the groups entitled to receive permits for each Sunday and for each week (iii) that the permits shall be issued to such groups in rotation (iv) that all occupiers shall be entitled to receive permits except those who have failed to remain open in accordance with the permits received by them (v) that the occupiers so failing shall cease to be entitled to permits for a time defined in the by-law. The Council has thus provided with sufficient particularity for the issuing of permits and, in my opinion, the duties imposed upon the City Clerk, (i) to select the occupiers to make up the respective groups, and (ii) to arrange the order of rotation, are administrative and are validly imposed.\nIt was finally argued that the by-law is bad for uncertainty in that it fails to state what constitutes an emergency. On this point I am in agreement with Roach J.A.[2] and would respectfully adopt the following passage from his reasons:\u2014\nThere will be lull compliance with sec. 6 (1) (2) of the by-law, which deals with an emergency service permit, if such permit simply states in the terms of the by-law that it is issued for emergency service only, and the Clerk is not called upon to define the scope of such emergency service. If an occupant of a service station to whom an emergency service permit is granted extends service which those charged with the responsibility of enforcing the by-law consider amounts to more than an emergency service, they may consider it their duty to prosecute the occupier, and on a trial on that charge it will become the duty of the Court trying the accused to determine whether or not the circumstances in fact amounted to an emergency. The failure to define the words does not invalidate the by-law.\nIn the result the appeal fails and should be dismissed. If the question before us had been whether the by-law was valid in toto it might have been necessary to consider whether there should be any apportionment of costs in view of it being held that the words above quoted in sections 7(2) and 8(2) of the by-law are invalid but severable, but since the question actually to be decided is whether the conviction is good or bad I think the respondent is entitled to costs.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRAND, J. (dissenting): This appeal is concerned with the validity of a by-law of the city of Hamilton providing for the closing of gasoline stations. The statute under which the council acted was The Factory, Shop and Office Building Act, c. 194, R.S.O. 1937. Sec. 82(3) of that Act, as amended, enacts:\u2014\nThe council of a city, town or village may by by-law require that during the whole or any part or parts of the year all or any class or classes of shops within the municipality shall be closed, and remain closed on each or any day of the week at and during any time or hours between six of the clock in the afternoon of any day and five of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day, but no such by-law shall be deemed to apply to the sale of fresh fruit.\nSec. 82a deals specifically with service stations and other places of gasoline sale, and by clauses (b) and (c) any bylaw enacted under sec. 82 may:\u2014\n(b) require that during the whole or any part or parts of the year such retail gasoline service stations, gasoline pumps and outlets be closed and remain closed at and during any time or hours between six of the clock in the afternoon of any day and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day and between six of the clock in the afternoon of Saturday and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following Monday; and\n(c) provide for the issuing of permits authorizing the retail gasoline service station, gasoline pump or outlet for which it is issued to be and remain open, notwithstanding the by-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit.\nThe by-law contained the following provisions:\u2014\n4. During the whole of the year, all gasoline shops shall, save as hereinafter in this Bylaw otherwise provided, be closed and remain closed:\u2014\n(a) Between seven of the clock in the afternoon of each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, respectively, and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following day; and\n(b) Between seven of the clock in the afternoon of each Saturday and seven of the clock in the forenoon of the next following Monday.\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4 hereof the City Clerk may, on the recommendation of the Property and License Committee, issue permits authorizing those gasoline shops for which such permits are issued, to be and remain open, notwithstanding the By-law, during the part or parts of the day or days specified in the permit.\nSec. 6 provided for Extension Permits to remain open from the first day of May until the last day of October between seven and ten o\u2019clock p.m. on week days and from ten a.m. to seven p.m. on Sundays, and a slight modification in the Sunday opening for the remainder of the year; and for Emergency Permits for emergency service only throughout the year.\nBy sec. 7(1) Extension Permits were for the week or Sunday as the case might be, in such number\nas most nearly approximates twenty-five per centum of the total number of gasoline shops in the city, according to the records of the City Clerk,\nand they were to be issued in rotation in order that each station should receive at least one permit in each calendar month. By s.s. (2):\u2014\nThe occupiers of all gasoline shops in the city shall be entitled to Extension Permits, except those occupiers who, according to evidence satisfactory to the City Clerk, have failed to keep their gasoline shops open during the whole of the time or times so authorized by such permits, on more than three days or on more than one Sunday in the current calendar year, in which case the City Clerk shall, for the balance of the calendar year or for three months, whichever is the longer period, omit every such occupier from the list of those entitled to receive Extension Permits.\nSimilar provision was made by sec. 8(1) for the issue of Emergency Permits for each week and in such number as most nearly approximated five per centum of the total number of gasoline shops in the city, which were to be subject to a like rotation. These permits, also, were not to be continued to those who, according to \u201cevidence satisfactory to the City Clerk,\u201d had \u201cfailed to keep their gasoline shops open for emergency service only during the whole of the time or times authorized by such permits, on more than three days in the current calendar year,\u201d for the balance of the year or for three months, whichever might be the longer period.\nAnd by sec. 9:\u2014\nSchemes of rotation of Extension Permits or of Emergency Service Permits or both, submitted by the majority of occupiers of gasoline shops in the City of Hamilton may be considered by the Property and License Committee in coming to a decision for recommending issuance of such Extension Permits or Emergency Service Permits or both.\nMr. Sweet argued the invalidity of the by-law on several grounds. Conceding that if the council laid down all essential features of the scheme administrative details could be left to a committee or an official, he contended that no part of the legislaive action or discretion reposed by the legislature in the council could be delegated to any other body or person and that in three respects of substance that had been done here. They were, first, in the determination of membership in the 25 per cent groups and the order of the permits; secondly, that the clerk could, on evidence \u201csatisfactory to him\u201d, refuse to continue Extension and Emergency Permits to those who had failed to keep their stations open as stipulated; and finally, that the provision for an Emergency Permit, without more, was too vague.\nWith Mr. Sweet\u2019s proposition there can be no quarrel; and where, as here, the right to trade as and when one pleases is involved, its restriction must be justified by action within the clear intention of the legislature. But there are other considerations of policy which, at times, are raised to qualify that right and in the legislation before us we have a familiar example. The object of the powers entrusted is, primarily, the health and general welfare of employees by limiting the hours of labour, but of course in a non-discriminatory impingement on the businesses affected. The question is whether the general requirement has been infringed.\nOnce it is provided that only 25 per cent of all stations are to be open on extended hours for weekdays or Sundays, the ascertainment of those to be allocated to the different groups and their order may involve the consideration of a great variety of matters. The object of these exceptions from the general prohibition is public service. Unless the determination of the composition of the groups and their open periods is by a rule of thumb, as by lot or alphabetical order, the consideration, for that purpose, of the geography of the city or its traffic currents or volume, or of the periods of greater or less demand, and, I have no doubt, of other pertinent factors, may lend itself to an exercise of significant judgment: at least I feel unable to say that it cannot.\nA precise equalization of participation in this privilege, even with the rotation, is quite impossible of measurement or accomplishment, and nothing better than a substantial or a rough equality could be hoped for. In view of that, can it be said that the judgment of the council as to the mode of selection and order is not interchangeable with that of a committee? For example, some traffic arteries may, no doubt, be the routes of the greatest volume of automobile operation on Sundays or holidays: could a committee\u2019s judgment prejudice stations in the groupings? or in the order of their rotation? Is it an answer that it would be a most inconvenient detail to thrust on the council, or that the council would, in all likelihood, adopt the committee\u2019s recommendation? Other like possibilities might be suggested. Can it be said with confidence that any imbalance in either respect would be corrected in the course of the year? Is it possible to say that no group selection basis could have the opposite effect of perpetuating a handicap? Mr. Arnup viewed the working out of the groups and periods as little more, in substance, than an exercise in mathematics, and at first I was disposed to agree with him. But the further examination of the question discloses so many possible significant factors and circumstances underlying the practical decision, that I am reluctantly driven to a conclusion I would prefer to avoid. If under a provision of the by-law the recommendation of the committee had been placed before the council and, after consideration, approved, the objection would have been met.\nOn the other points, I agree that to leave it to the clerk to declare the fact of being closed during the currency of a permit on evidence \u201csatisfactory to him\u201d is objectionable; but it is a severable provision, and that phrase can be eliminated leaving the matter as one of fact. The clerk must indeed make his own decision when a renewal of the permit is called for, but it would be open on an application for a mandamus to challenge his finding on the ground that it was not supported by evidence.\nThe final ground of vagueness I would reject. An emergency may arise out of such a variety of circumstances and be of such a nature as to defy precise definition. Whether, in any case, the occasion was one of emergency would, then, also, be a question open to a court, in which the problem of determining whether it did or did not come within the scope of the word as used would be a simple task compared with the formulation of a definition.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.A. Sweet.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.J. Polson.\n[1] [1951] O.R. 715.\n[2] [1951] O.R. 715 at 725.\n",

Amyot-Forget, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 82\nDate: 1952-12-15\nGuy Bernard and Others (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nDame Albert Amyot-Forget and Others (Defendants) Respondents\n1952: May 29; 1952: December 15.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nWill \u2014 Substitution \u2014 Children \u2014 Grandchildren \u2014 Whether great-grandchildren included\u2014Whether rule of representation of Article 980 C.C. applicable\u2014Article 609 C.P.\nThe testator's will provided that on the death or remarriage of his widow the children issue of his marriage should have the usufruct of his property and that on the extinction of the usufruct the ownership should pass to \"the children issue of the lawful marriage of my children, that is to say my grandchildren\". It is admitted that the will created a fiduciary substitution and that the final opening of the substitution has occurred.\nThe appellants, whose parents died prior to the date of distribution of the estate, claimed, as great-grandchildren of the testator, the shares which their parents, as grandchildren of the testator, would have received had they survived. Their action was dismissed by the Superior Court and by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed. The rule of representation enunciated in Article 980 C.C. applied. The words \"children\" and \"grandchildren\" as used in the will applied to all the descendants of the testator and, therefore, to his great-grandchildren as well as to his grandchildren.\nPer Rand J.: The word \"grandchildren\" is used without qualification and, therefore, Article 980 C.C. disposes of the question. The phrase \"that is to say\" is introductory to a form of statement equivalent in meaning to one already made and its effect is the same as if the equivalent expression had been used alone in the first instance. Even if this were to produce tautology, it would not be sufficient to change the legal meaning of the words. The instrument leaves no doubt of the general intention that the property should pass to the direct descendants by equal division between the family lines of the children.\nLocke J. agreed with Barclay J. that the words \"that is to say my grandchildren\" following the words \"the children issue of the lawful marriage of my children\" should be construed as being merely explanatory and not limitative. The testator must be assumed to have known the law and the significance of the word \"grandchildren\" used without qualification.\nPer Cartwright J. : If it was the intention of the testator to qualify or cut down the meaning ascribed to the word \"children\" by Article 980 C.C, it is unlikely that the notary who prepared the will would have chosen as a word of qualification a word to which the same meaning is ascribed by the same Article of the Code. It is more reasonable to suppose that an unnecessary and repetitious phrase was used. Per Rinfret C.J. (dissenting): Since the words \"children\" and \"grandchildren\" are qualified, Article 980 C.C. cannot be invoked in favour of the appellants. The phrase \"that is to say my grandchildren\" would be meaningless if it were not descriptive. Without inquiring into the reasons of the testator but giving the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will, the property should go to the children issue of the lawful marriage of his children who can never be the great-grandchildren.\nPer Taschereau J. (dissenting) : The word \"grandchildren\" is not used without qualification and the expressions accompanying it are sufficiently clear to justify the exclusion of the great-grandchildren from the disposition. The words cannot be a meaningless repetition and must be given a meaning. The words determine the intention of the testator and indicate who should benefit.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Barclay and Pratte JJ.A. dissenting, the dismissal of the action by the Superior Court in an action taken by the great-grandchildren of the testator.\nJ. P. Lanctot, Q.C., for the appellants.\nA. Laurendeau, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): Dans la cause de M\u00e9tivier v. Parent 2, cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 unanimement:\nThe general provisions of the Civil Code (Arts. 1013 et seq.) enacting certain rules of interpretation as to contracts are applicable, by analogy, to arrive at the true meaning of the clauses of a will, taking into account however the difference existing between a contract and a will. Therefore, in a will as in a contract, the real intention of the testator must first be looked for and such intention will be found by giving a fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will; and it is only when the intention is really doubtful that it is permissible to go outside the literal meaning of the words.\nIl suit de cette d\u00e9cision que l'on doit interpr\u00e9ter la volont\u00e9 du testateur suivant le sens litt\u00e9ral des termes qu'il a employ\u00e9s et que l'on ne doit chercher son intention par voie d'interpr\u00e9tation que lorsque cette intention est douteuse. (1013 C.C.) En plus, toutes les clauses d'un testament doivent s'interpr\u00e9ter les unes par les autres, en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l'acte entier (1018 C.C). Dans la cause de Auger v. Beaudry 3, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9:\n\u2026But whatever wavering from the strict rule of construction may have taken place in the past, it is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will. Human motives are too uncertain to render it wise or safe to leave the firm guide of the words used for the uncertain direction of what it must be assumed that a reasonable man would mean.\nCe sont l\u00e0 les principes qui doivent nous guider pour l'adjudication sur le point de droit que les parties nous ont soumis en se pr\u00e9valant des articles 509 et suivants du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nLa question est tr\u00e8s simple :\nPar son testament, dat\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 15 avril 1875, M. Jean-Baptiste Dufort a dispos\u00e9 de ses biens, tant en usufruit qu'en capital, en faveur de son \u00e9pouse et de ses enfants. Il leur a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la jouissance et usufruit de ses biens leur vie durant, puis, \u00e0 la Clause sixi\u00e8me du testament, il a ajout\u00e9:\n\u2026Et quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes biens, je la donne et l\u00e8gue aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants; lesquels diviseront et partageront mes biens entre eux par parts et portions \u00e9gales par souches, apr\u00e8s l'extinction de l'usufruit par moi l\u00e9gu\u00e9 tant \u00e0 madite \u00e9pouse qu'\u00e0 mes enfants.\nLes appelants, qui sont les arri\u00e8re petits-enfants du testateur, ont pr\u00e9tendu que cette clause les incluait dans la disposition. Les intim\u00e9s, au contraire, ont conclu \u00e0 ce qu'ils soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s les seuls appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs aux biens substitu\u00e9s, vu qu'ils sont les seuls survivants des enfants du testateur.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 ces derniers et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 4.\nLa demande des appelants est bas\u00e9e sur l'article 980 C.C., qui se lit comme suit :\nArt. 980. Dans la prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner, comme dans la substitution, et dans les donations et les legs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le terme enfants ou petits enfants, employ\u00e9 seul soit dans la disposition, soit dans la condition, s'applique \u00e0 tous les descendants avec ou sans gradualit\u00e9 suivant la nature de l'acte. Et la pr\u00e9tention des appelants est que par application de cet article les mots \"enfants\" et \"petits-enfants\" doivent \u00eatre compris comme s'appliquant \u00e0 tous les descendants.\nDe m\u00eame que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, je ne puis me rendre \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation.\nEn vertu de l'article 872 C.C., \"Les r\u00e8gles qui concernent les legs et les pr\u00e9somptions de la volont\u00e9 du testateur, ainsi que le sens attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 certains termes, c\u00e8dent devant l'expression formelle ou autrement suffisante de cette volont\u00e9 dans un autre sens et pour avoir un effet diff\u00e9rent\".\nOr, la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e dans l'article 980 C.C ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e ici par les appelants. En effet, cette r\u00e8gle ne s'applique que lorsque le terme \"enfants\" ou \"petits enfants\" est \"employ\u00e9 seul\". Ce texte de l'article 980 C.C. est encore plus formel que le texte en langue anglaise \"without qualification\". Ainsi que le fait remarquer l'honorable Juge Marchand, qui a fait partie de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, le testateur n'a jamais employ\u00e9 ces termes seuls. Cela, d\u00e9j\u00e0, serait suffisant pour que l'article 980 ne r\u00e9gisse pas la Clause sixi\u00e8me du testament.\nMais il y a plus. Introduire cette r\u00e8gle pour interpr\u00e9ter la clause am\u00e8nerait \u00e0 une redondance ou \u00e0 l'emploi de mots inutiles. Si, au lieu de constituer une description, cette phrase ne devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e que comme n'ajoutant rien aux mots \"petits enfants\" qui la pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, alors cette phrase \u00e9tait inutile.\nEn outre, si l'on veut lui appliquer l'article 980 C.C, alors il faudrait lire la clause: \"Je l\u00e8gue aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits enfants\" comme si elle se lisait: Je l\u00e8gue \"aux descendants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes descendants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes descendants\". On ne saurait ainsi travestir l'intention du testateur. Au contraire, en traitant les mots \"c'est-\u00e0-dire mes petits enfants\" comme excluant les arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants, qui sont les appelants, on arrive \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation coh\u00e9rente de la Clause sixi\u00e8me. Ce que dit le testateur, en effet, c'est qu'il l\u00e8gue \"aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants\"; et si l'on applique les r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation reconnues comme s'appliquant aux testaments dans notre jugement de M\u00e9tivier v. Parent, si l'on adopte le sens litt\u00e9ral des mots employ\u00e9s, les biens vont aux enfants n\u00e9s du mariage des enfants du testateur. Or, il est \u00e9vident que les enfants n\u00e9s du mariage des enfants du testateur ne peuvent \u00eatre que les petits-enfants. Les arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants ne peuvent jamais \u00eatre . les enfants n\u00e9s du mariage des enfants du testateur. Le testateur les a donc exclus, et, si nous \u00e9coutons les sages avis du Conseil Priv\u00e9 cit\u00e9s plus haut, nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous demander quels ont pu \u00eatre les motifs du testateur en excluant les arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 sp\u00e9culer sur la raison pour laquelle il a cru devoir disposer de ses biens ainsi qu'il le dit dans son testament. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 nous en avertit dans Auger v. Beaudry. \"\u2026It is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will\".\nJe suis donc d'avis que les jugements dont est appel doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s, avec d\u00e9pens.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting) : Par son testament re\u00e7u \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 15 avril 1875, devant les notaires Dumouchel et H\u00e9tu, Jean-Baptiste Duford a laiss\u00e9 la jouissance de ses biens \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, Dame V\u00e9lanire Laporte. Au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re, les enfants issus du mariage du testateur et de son \u00e9pouse devaient \u00e0 leur tour \u00eatre saisis des biens \u00e0 titre de grev\u00e9s, et pour employer les termes m\u00eames du testateur, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la totalit\u00e9 du patrimoine \u00e9tait d\u00e9volue \"aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants; lesquels diviseront et partageront mes biens entre eux par parts et portions \u00e9gales et par souches\u2026\"\nLe testateur est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1876, laissant son \u00e9pouse, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 son tour en 1901, et cinq enfants tous \u00e9galement d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s respectivement en 1909, 19l3, 1945, 1946 et 1949.\nFortunate Duford Boisseau, l'une des filles du testateur, eut cinq enfants. Deux, Robert et Alice, maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, en ont eu quatre qui se trouvent les arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants du testateur, et qui sont les demandeurs-appelants dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. C'est leur pr\u00e9tention que par l'op\u00e9ration de l'article 980 C.C., le terme \"petits-enfants\" dans le testament cr\u00e9ant la substitution s'applique \u00e0 tous les descendants, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, ils doivent h\u00e9riter comme appel\u00e9s au m\u00eame titre que les autres petits-enfants. M. le Juge Smith de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ainsi que la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel 5, ont rejet\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9tentions.\nL'article 980 C.C. est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\n980. Dans la prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner, comme dans la substitution, et dansl les donations et les legs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le terme enfants ou petits-enfants, employ\u00e9 seul soit dans la disposition soit dans la condition, s'applique \u00e0 tous les descendants avec ou sans gradualit\u00e9 suivant la nature de l'acte.\nIl est important de signaler que le terme \"petits-enfants\" s'\u00e9tend aux \"arri\u00e8re petits-enfants\", quand il est employ\u00e9 seul, c'est-\u00e0-dire, comme le dit le texte anglais, sans qualification. Si on trouve dans la disposition quelque expression qui d\u00e9montre une intention contraire, il faut laisser au terme \"petits-enfants\" son sens ordinaire, et ne pas lui donner l'extension que le Code permet, quand il est employ\u00e9 seul.\nJe partage les vues du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et celles exprim\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel. Les mots \"petits-enfants\" ne sont pas employ\u00e9s seuls, et les expressions qui les accompagnent sont, je crois, suffisamment claires pour nous justifier d'exclure les \"arri\u00e8re petits-enfants\" de la disposition testamentaire. \"Aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants\", sont des mots qui pr\u00e9cisent l'intention du testateur et qui indiquent quels sont ceux, et ceux-l\u00e0 seuls qui devaient \u00eatre les appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement donner un sens aux mots \"c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants\". A moins de les consid\u00e9rer comme une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition inutile, ce que je ne puis faire, ils doivent qualifier les mots \"les enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants\". C'est \u00e0 eux, \u00e0 ses \"petits-enfants\" que le testateur me para\u00eet avoir limit\u00e9 l'\u00e9tendue de sa lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et qu'il a voulu l\u00e9guer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive de ses biens. En d'autres termes, le testateur a dit qu'il instituait comme appel\u00e9s ceux-l\u00e0 qui na\u00eetront du mariage de ses enfants, et il qualifie ces mots en disant que ce seront ses \"petits-enfants\".\nEn vertu de l'article 980 C.C, les mots \"enfants\" et \"petits-enfants\" s'appliquent \u00e0 tous les descendants, et comme le fait remarquer le juge au proc\u00e8s, si l'on substitue le mot \"descendants\" aux mots \"enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre\" et \"petits-enfants\" on arrive avec la disposition suivante, o\u00f9 la derni\u00e8re partie n'est plus l'explication de la premi\u00e8re que le testateur a voulu \u00e9videmment donner en employant les mots \"c'est-\u00e0-dire\": \"Je l\u00e8gue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes biens aux descendants \u00e0 na\u00eetre de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 leurs descendants\".\nJe ne crois pas que le testateur ait eu l'intention d'ins\u00e9rer dans son testament une clause qui comporterait une aussi inutile r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, et qui enl\u00e8verait tout sens aux mots \"c'est-\u00e0-dire\", employ\u00e9s \u00e9videmment pour pr\u00e9ciser sa volont\u00e9.\nJe crois que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nRand J. : The question in this appeal is the interpretation of a clause in a will which reads:\nEt quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes biens, je la donne et l\u00e8gue aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants; lesquels diviseront et partageront mes biens entre eux par parts et portions \u00e9gales par souches, apr\u00e8s l'extinction de l'usufruit par moi l\u00e9gu\u00e9 tant \u00e0 ma dite \u00e9pouse qu'\u00e0 mes enfants.\nArt. 980 of the Code provides:\nIn the prohibition to alienate, as in substitutions, and in gifts and legacies in general, the terms children or grandchildren, made use of without qualification either in the disposition or in the condition, apply to all the descendants, without the effect of extending to more than one degree according to the terms of the act.\nThe point is whether the words \"petits-enfants\" in the clause are used \"without qualification\" ; and in determining that, the meaning of the language as the expressed intention of the testator is to be ascertained before any resort is made to the Code.\nA qualification is said to be introduced by the expression \"c'est-\u00e0-dire\": this, it is argued, signifies an exclusiveness to the grandchildren and as if the word \"only\" had been added. I must confess to a difficulty in drawing any such meaning from the phrase. Its literal translation in English is the ordinary expression, \"that is to say\", and so far as I can gather it means the same thing in French: in other words, it is introductory to a form of statement equivalent in meaning to one already made, and its effect is the same as if the equivalent expression had been used alone in the first instance. This sense is objected to as producing tautology. No doubt we endeavour to give all words in an instrument effective meaning; but tautology is too universal a weakness or, as sometimes, strength, to give rise to a rule of interpretation that controls what would otherwise be the proper construction of the language used.\nThe will was made in 1875 and the testator died in the following year, and the instrument leaves no doubt of the general intention that the property should pass to the direct descendants by equal division between the family lines of the children. Why should we be astute to find a qualification that arbitrarily arrests that descent? As we are seeking what was in the mind of the testator from the words used, and what he would have declared to be his intention had the question been put to him, it is, I think, involving oneself in a wholly unnecessary verbal tangle to discover even doubt in the language here. On that view, the article of the Code disposes of the question.\nAgreeing, therefore, with Barclay and Pratte, JJ. in the court below, I would allow the appeal and direct a declaration accordingly, with costs in all courts.\nLocke J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of King's Bench by Mr. Justice Barclay 6 and would allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the terms of the will of the late Jean Baptiste Duford are set out in sufficient detail in the judgments of other members of the Court.\nI am in substantial agreement with the reasons of my brother Rand and with those of Barclay and Pratte JJ. and desire to add only a few words.\nIt is common ground that the capital of the testator's estate is to be distributed at the date of the death of his last surviving child, which occurred in October 1949, and the question to be determined on this appeal is whether the appellants, who are great-grandchildren of the testator whose parents died prior to the date of distribution, are entitled to the shares which such parents would have received had they survived. The question turns on the following words in the will:\n\u2026je la donne et l\u00e8gue aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 mes petits-enfants; lesquels diviseront et partageront mes biens entre eux par parts et portions \u00e9gales par souches,\u2026\nI do not understand that any of the learned judges in the courts below or counsel who argued the appeal before us disagreed with the following statement of Pratte J. 7:\nSi, dans la disposition sous examen, le testateur avait dit seulement: \"Je l\u00e8gue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes biens aux enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants\", il ne ferait pas de doute, \u00e0 mon avis, que les arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants seraient compris dans la disposition. De m\u00eame, s'il avait dit seulement qu'il l\u00e9guait ses biens \u00e0 ses petits-enfants, la m\u00eame solution s'imposerait n\u00e9cessairement, par application de l'art. 980 C.C.\nThe learned judge of first instance and the majority in the Court of Appeal were, however, of opinion that the two expressions \"enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants\" and \"mes petits-enfants\" coupled by the words \"c'est-\u00e0-dire\" qualify each other so as to change the meaning which either standing alone would have had to \"grandchildren excluding any remoter issue.\"\nThe will was prepared by a Notary who may safely be assumed to have been familiar with the terms of Article 980 of the Civil Code. I find it difficult to accept the view that if it was his intention to qualify or cut down the meaning ascribed by the Code to the words \"enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitime mariage de mes enfants\", i.e. \"descendants\" he would choose as words of qualification other words to which the same meaning is ascribed by the same article of the Code. Forced to choose between the two alternatives, I find it more reasonable to suppose that he used an unnecessary and repetitious phrase.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Rand.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

Baskerville [1916] 2 K.B. 658, it was held that, on a charge of theft, the jury were rightly told that the evidence as to a certain cheque was capable of being corroborative of the testimony of the accomplice who was the main witness against the appellant. Applying Hubin v. The King [1927] S.C.R. 442, it was also held that the jury should have been told that it was for them to decide if it was in fact corroborative. As it was impossible to state that no substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred, the appeal was allowed and a new trial directed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction on a charge of theft.\nA.E. Moloney for the appellant.\nW.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted in the Court of the General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of York on a charge that in the year 1950 he stole approximately $38,000 in money, the property of S.P. Ryan, A.D. McAlpine and J.M. Ryan, contrary to the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal from his conviction and sentence and, pursuant to section 1025 of the Code, he appealed to this Court in accordance with leave granted by Cartwright J. on the following grounds:\u2014\n(a) Was the alleged fact that a certain cheque was given by the appellant to one, Elsie Teasdale, in or about the month of April, 1950, capable in law of being corroboration of the testimony of the said Elsie Teasdale?\n(b) Did the learned trial judge usurp the functions of the jury in instructing them that the evidence concerning the said cheque was corroborative? In view of the conclusion reached, it is not advisable to refer to the evidence at the trial in detail. The substance of the charge against the appellant was that he had counselled and procured Elsie Teasdale to steal the money in question from her employers, the parties named in the indictment. Elsie Teasdale had already pleaded guilty to a charge of theft and had been sentenced. She was the main witness called against the appellant, and the trial judge charged the jury that as she was an accomplice they ought not to convict on her uncorroborated testimony. He also told the jury that the cheque given by the appellant to her in or about the month of April, 1950, was capable in law of being such corroboration. This cheque could not be found but, notwithstanding the argument of counsel for the appellant, we are satisfied that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that it had in fact been signed by the appellant and given to Elsie Teasdale.\nThen it was said that while on her own testimony the cheque was to repay the amounts she had given the appellant from her own funds and from the sums she had stolen from her employers up to that time, the amount of the cheque exceeded the total of all of these amounts down to the date of the cheque. However, the jury were entitled to accept Elsie Teasdale\u2019s evidence that the amount of the cheque represented the approximate total and that any excess was to be repaid by her to the appellant. In that view of the matter and considering all the other evidence, the cheque was capable in law of being corroborative as it falls within the classical statement as to what may be corroboration as found in Rex v. Baskerville[1]. The answer, therefore, to the first question must be in the affirmative.\nThe second question must also be answered in the affirmative. The charge to the jury must, of course, be read as a whole but it is necessary to refer only to the following portions of it. At one stage the trial judge told the jury:\u2014\nI will tell you here there is some evidence corroborative of her evidence and if you accept that evidence you may believe her evidence, accept the whole of her story. Later, after referring to the evidence as to the existence of the cheque given by the various bank officials, the trial judge continued:\u2014\nGentlemen, you may or may not accept that evidence. If you do, that is evidence corroborative in a material respect and you may believe the whole or necessary parts of Miss Teasdale\u2019s evidence to bring in a verdict. If you do not accept the evidence as corroborative of her story, as I told you, you ought not to convict and should bring in a verdict of not guilty.\nAfter considering the matter for over four hours, the jury returned and the foreman asked the following questions:\u2014\n... something was said about the fact that it was unusual to convict person based on or solely on the evidence of a convicted member or party to the offence. Could you perhaps go over that for us again and clarify it just to what extent?\nThe trial judge replied:\u2014\nI am very glad you asked about that because they are very important. You see, there is not enough evidence in this case, gentlemen, to convict the accused unless you accept the whole or important parts of the evidence of Miss Teasdale.\nNow, as I have told you as a matter of law, as I am supposed to tell you the law, she is in law what is known as an accomplice, that is, if you find the accused guilty the two of them were both in it, she is guilty anyway, she is what you call an accomplice. You realize when you have two people accused of something there might be a tendency to put the blame on the other so a person who is admittedly guilty of a crime may not be too reliable, so the law is laid down that the judge must tell the jury they ought not to convict the accused on the evidence of an accomplice alone, it must be corroborated, that is, there must be some other evidence which backs it up in some material particular.\nI have explained to you here that there is such evidence, which you accept it as corroboration, if you accept that evidence you may take her story, holus bolus if you want to. It is all in your hands; if there is no corroboration, I have to tell you there is not. Here I explained what the corroboration was; it was the evidence concerning this cheque which was signed by the accused which went through the bank. You heard the evidence about that and if you believe that evidence and accept it, it is open to you to accept the whole or any part of Miss Teasdale\u2019s evidence.\nParticularly bearing in mind this last quotation, we think the charge was defective and that the jury should have been told clearly that the evidence as to the cheque was capable of being corroboration but that it was for them to decide if it was in fact corroborative. In Hubin v. The King[2], this Court decided, at page 444, that \u201cwhether corroborative inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury.\u201d This rule was infringed in the present case and it is impossible to state that no substantial wrong or miscarriage has occurred. This appeal must therefore be allowed and a new trial directed.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Edmonds & Maloney.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.B.

Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld. [1951] A.C. 297; In re Compton [1945] Ch. 123; In re Hobourn Aero Components Ld.\u2019s Air Raid Distress Fund [1946] Ch. 194 and In re Drummond [1942] 2 Ch. 90.\nPer: Rand and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting)\u2014The residuary clause declares a general charitable intent and impresses upon the residue a trust for that purpose. The word \u201cdirectly\u201d restricts direct benefits to those mentioned and implies that all other benefits are to be indirect, but since the benefit to the specified class violates the rules laid down requiring that public quality in the recipients defined by the cases mentioned, it follows that only by indirect benefits to individuals as by grants to charitable agencies or objects are the funds to be dealt with by the trustees.\nRand J. was of opinion that failure of the benefits to the employees of the Assurance Company did not cause the appointment of the Board of Directors as the body to determine the distribution of the funds to also fail but rather that the absolute discretionary appropriation to charity of the property generally was conferred upon the Board.\nCartwright J. was of opinion that since the mode of carrying the testator\u2019s general charitable intention into effect could not be carried out, the matter should be referred back so that proper proceedings could be taken for the propounding and settlement of a scheme for the application cy-pr\u00e8s of the residuary estate.\nAPPEALS by the representative of the employees of The Canada Life Assurance Co. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] construing the residuary clause in the wills of the late Herbert Coplin Cox and his widow the late Louise Bogart Cox.

The Trust Fund is to be known as \u201cThe Cox Foundation\u201d in memory of the family whose name has been so long associated with the said Company.\nThe first point to be determined is the proper construction of this clause. If it consisted merely of the opening words \u201cTo pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only\u201d that would be a good charitable trust, and it is therefore argued that while in the latter part of the clause the only persons to benefit \u201cdirectly\u201d from the application of the income are the present and former employees (and their dependants) of The Canada Life Assurance Company, there is an area of indirect benefit untouched by such latter part but which falls within the opening words. As against this it might be suggested that, if that were so and assuming the latter direction would not fall within the scope of legal charity, the funds could be applied for either purpose. It might be also suggested that, in that event, the present case could not be distinguished from those where the fund could be diverted in the trustees\u2019 discretion to an object totally uncharitable in the legal sense with the result that the whole bequest would be void: Hunter v. A.G.[3]; Chichester Diocesan Fund and Board of Finance v. Simpson[4].\nThe point need not be determined on this appeal because the word \u201cdirectly\u201d does not operate in the manner suggested as I construe the clause to mean that the charitable purposes for which the income is to be paid in perpetuity are the employees and dependants. Members of that class must of necessity benefit directly as a trust for indirect benefits would be too vague for the Court to enforce. The word \u201cdirectly\u201d therefore adds nothing. On that construction it is not a case of there being a charitable intention with merely the particular mode of application failing for illegality or some other reason, and the cases cited on that branch of the matter have no application.\nUpon a consideration of the numerous decisions, it is clear that, if the objects of a trust are not charitable in themselves, it is not a charitable trust, and the fact that the donor thought his gift charitable is not relevant to the issue: Tudor on Charities, 5th edition, page 8. The circumstance, therefore, that the testator directed his trustees to pay the income for charitable purposes only does not determine the matter when, as I believe, the only purposes to which the moneys may be applied are not charitable. It has now been settled that the element of public benefit is essential for all charities no matter in which of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classifications in Income Tax Commissioners v. Pemsell[5], they fall. The only exception is the anomalous case of trusts for the relief of poverty and, here, that condition does not exist. Mr. Robinette contended that, granted the words \u201cto pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only\u201d would, by themselves, establish a valid charitable trust, it should be held that the succeeding part of the clause applied only to indigent or necessitous persons. However, this succeeding part permits the Board of Directors to choose employees and dependants who are not poor and the argument fails.\nAs pointed out by Lord Simonds in Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld.[6], when the trust is for the benefit of a class of persons, the question is whether that class can be regarded as such a \u201csection of the community\u201d as to satisfy the test of public benefit. He points out that these words, \u201csection of the community\u201d, have no special sanctity, \u201cbut they conveniently indicate first, that the possible (I emphasize the word \u201cpossible\u201d) beneficiaries must not be numerically negligible, and secondly, that the quality which distinguishes them from other members of the community, so that they form by themselves a section of it, must be a quality which does not depend on their relationship to a particular individual. It is for this reason that a trust for the education of members of a family or, as In re Compton[7], of a number of families cannot be regarded as charitable. A group of persons may be numerous but, if the nexus between them is their personal relationship to a single propositus or to several propositi, they are neither the community nor a section of the community for charitable purposes.\u201d\nThe House of Lords approved the judgments of Lord Greene as Master of the Rolls in In re Compton7, and of Lord Greene and of Lord Justice Morton (as he then was) in In re Hobourn Aero Components Ltd.\u2019s Air-raid Distress Fund[8]. The decision in In re Drummond[9] was also approved. That decided that trusts for the benefit of employees past, present or future of an employer are not public charities. In re Rayner[10], was regarded as of doubtful authority. As pointed out by Lord Morton of Henryton, the Court of Appeal in Gibson v. South American Stores (Gath and Chaves) Ld.[11], felt obliged because of the rule of stare decisis to follow an unreported decision of its own in 1935, In re Sir Robert Laidlaw, and to hold that a trust was valid which was for all persons who in the opinion of a Board of Directors are, or should be necessitous and deserving, and who had been in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary thereof, and dependants thereof. The element of poverty was present and it was held to be a valid charitable trust notwithstanding the limited nature of the class of beneficiaries. I have already pointed out that the element of poverty does not enter into the present matter and, in my opinion, the decision in Oppenheim is decisive.\nIt is decisive notwithstanding that at the date of the application to Wells J. the persons who would answer the description of employees, past or present, of the Company, and dependants of such employees, were estimated to be in excess of thirty thousand, and that some of these were in such circumstances as to require financial aid. Even if those facts satisfied the first test of a \u201csection of the community\u201d, the second requirement is a quality which does not depend on the relationship of the members thereof to a particular individual. When the Hobourn case came before the Court of Appeal, it was contended that the observations of that Court in Compton that a trust for the benefit of employees of a business was a purely private and personal trust were dicta only. At page 200, Lord Greene stated his belief in the correctness of those observations, and at page 208, Lord Justice Morton said quite plainly that he entirely approved of the Drummond decision. In the Hobourn case the Court was not dealing with a fund put up by outside persons but, at page 200, Lord Greene stated that \u201ceven if we were, I should on the authority of In re Compton feel constrained to hold that such a fund would not be a good charity.\u201d Lord Justice Morton was of the same opinion and Lord Justice Somervell agreed. In view of the approval by the House of Lords of the decisions in Compton and Hobourn, the matter would appear to be concluded.\nIt was argued that the law should not be the same for Ontario but even if the decision in Oppenheim had never been given, I would hold that its basis, as found in the judgments of Lord Greene in Compton and of Lord Greene and of Lord Justice Morton in Hobourn, is a complete and satisfactory method of disposing of the present issue. I adopt, if I may, the words of Lord Simonds in Oppenheim: \u201cIt must not I think be forgotten that charitable institutions enjoy rare and increasing privileges and that the claim to come within that privileged class should be clearly established.\u201d Those privileges, it might be added, are, of course, not confined to the receipt of benefits in perpetuity under a will.\nThe appeal should be dismissed subject to a variation to which Mr. Snider drew our attention. The testator\u2019s widow survived her husband, and paragraph 5 of the judgment of Wells J., as inserted in the Court of Appeal order, should be stricken out and the following substituted therefor:\u2014\n5. And there therefore being an intestacy as to such balance of the testator\u2019s residuary estate, THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that it be referred to the Master of this Court at Toronto to determine and report who were entitled thereto at the date of the death of the testator.\nThe costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate, those of the surviving administrator with the will annexed and trustee of the testator\u2019s will and codicil as between solicitor and client.\nThe residuary clause in the will of the testator\u2019s widow is the same as in her husband\u2019s and the same order should, therefore, go in the appeal in connection with her estate except that there is no necessity of any alteration in the order of the Court of Appeal. RAND J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the construction placed on the residuary clause by my brother Cartwright, that it declares a general charitable intent and impresses upon the residue a trust for that purpose; I agree, also, that the word \u201cdirectly\u201d is significant, that it restricts direct benefits to those mentioned and implies that all other benefits are to be indirect; I agree, finally, that the benefit to the specified class violates the rules laid down requiring that public quality in the recipients defined by the cases mentioned. It follows that only by indirect benefits to individuals, as by grants to charitable agencies or objects such as libraries, hospitals, schools, churches, works or institutions, are the funds to be dealt with by the Trustees.But I am unable to concur in the view that by reason of the failure of the benefits to the employees of the Assurance Company, the appointment of the Board of Directors as the body to determine the distribution of the funds, must be taken also to fail. The absolute discretionary appropriation to charity of the property generally was conferred upon the Board; benefits might or might not be awarded to the employee group: they might from time to time be bestowed exclusively on other objects. The reasons leading the testator to select the Board would, from the evidence, seem to be obvious. He, himself, as well as others of the Cox family, had long been associated with the Company, and he had come to know and, undoubtedly, appreciate the competency and character of those who constituted its Board. It may be also that that long family connection had, directly or indirectly, in some degree, enabled the accumulation of the wealth of which he was disposing, and it was an easy step to associating the Company with its distribution as a public benefaction.\nIn these circumstances I cannot take the designation of the Board to have been bound up with the intended benefits, to the employees. The discretion extended over the whole charitable field; and I find nothing to indicate that had there not been the special provision for the employees, that discretion would have been placed elsewhere. I should think, on the contrary, that, in his opinion, the perpetuation of the family name in the maintenance of a charitable Foundation would be uniquely served by such an intimate office on the part of the Board. I would therefore declare the bequest in both testaments to be a valid gift to charity, the income to be applied by the trustees to such charitable purposes with indirect personal benefits only as the Board in their discretion think proper.\nThe costs of all parties should be paid out of the estates as proposed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014As the question arising in these appeals is common to both, it will be convenient to deal with the will of the male deceased. The relevant paragraph reads as follows: (As to which see page 96).\nWells J., the judge of first instance, construed this disposition as a good charitable bequest confined to the relief of poverty among the class described. The Court of Appeal appears to have entertained the same view with respect to the question of construction, but reversed the judgment of Wells J. on the ground that a trust for the relief of poverty confined to such a class was not a valid trust. In the view of Roach J., who delivered the judgment of the court, such a trust lacked the necessary public character.\nThe appellant, while adopting the construction of the will accepted in the courts below, contends that the Court of Appeal erred in its view of the law. Appellant contends further that, while the class denned by the testator comprises the only persons who are to benefit \u201cdirectly\u201d from the trust, the testator has expressed a general charitable intention and has left his gift to operate in the field of \u201cindirect\u201d benefit.\nIn its popular sense, \u201ccharity\u201d does not coincide with its legal meaning but, as stated by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel\u2019s case[12], adopting the argument of Sir Samuel Romilly in Morice v. Bishop of Durham[13],\n\u201cCharity\u201d in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes, beneficial to the community, not falling under any of the preceding heads. In Verge v. Somerville[14], Lord Wrenbury said at p. 499:\nTo ascertain whether a gift constitutes a valid charitable trust so as to escape being void on the ground of perpetuity, a first inquiry must be whether it is public\u2014whether it is for the benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the community. The inhabitants of a parish or town, or any particular class of such inhabitants, may, for instance, be the objects of such a gift, but private individuals, or a fluctuating body of private individuals, cannot.\nLord Greene M.R. in Compton\u2019s case[15], said with reference to the above proposition that it is true with respect to all charitable gifts and is \u201cnot confined to the fourth class in Lord Macnaghten\u2019s well known statement in Pemsel\u2019s case.\u201d\nIn the submission of the appellant, any trust for the relief of poverty creates, per se, a public benefit. Accordingly, while admitting that the trust here in question cannot, on the law as stated by Lord Wrenbury, be upheld as applied to the last three heads of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classification, the appellant submits that if the language here in question may be construed as the appellant seeks to construe it, the trust is valid with respect to the first head, namely, for the relief of poverty within the group defined by the testator.\nThe initial question, therefore, is as to the true construction of the language which the testator used. Appellant says that the words \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d are to be construed as though the testator had said, \u201cfor such legal charitable purposes as the law recognizes\u201d within the class of beneficiaries defined.\nAs I have said, this construction of the testator\u2019s language found acceptance in the courts below, but I am regretfully unable to come to that conclusion. The word \u201ccharitable,\u201d construed in its legal sense, comprises all of the four heads already mentioned, and I find nothing in the language used which permits me to eliminate therefrom any of them. To put the matter more plainly, I see no escape from reading the words used as though the testator had set out seriatim the said four heads. This being so, the testator has empowered his trustees, even on the appellant\u2019s thesis, to apply the subject matter of the trust for charitable and non-charitable purposes, thereby empowering them to devote the whole, if they please, to the non-charitable. The \u201capplication of such income\u201d is left entirely to the discretion of the directors of the company and the bequest is therefore void; Morice v. Bishop of Durham[16]. In my view, therefore, the basis of the argument of the appellant fails on this branch of the case.\nIn 1938 when the will here in question was executed, a testator might not unreasonably have thought, in the state of the authorities at that time, that a valid trust for purposes embracing all of the four heads of charity could be created for the benefit of a class such as the employees of a particular company and their dependents. In 1881 the case of Spiller v. Maude[17], had come before Jessel M.R. That case dealt with a fund derived from subscriptions made by members of a company of actors and actresses for the benefit of the members and their dependents. The learned Master of the Rolls came to the conclusion that poverty was clearly an ingredient in the qualification of members who should receive benefits and that the fund was, accordingly, charitable. Again in 1896, in In Re Buck[18], Kekewich J. decided similarly with respect to the funds of a Friendly Society. In 1900, also, in In Re Gosling[19], Byrne J. upheld as a good charitable trust, a fund for the purpose of pensioning off old and worn-out clerks of a particular firm.\nIn 1914, the case of In Re Drummond[20], came before Eve J., who held that a trust for the purpose of providing holiday expenses for the employees of one department of a company was invalid as not being a trust for public purposes but for private individuals. But, in 1920 the same learned judge, in Re Rayner[21], had to consider the validity of a trust for the education of children of the employees of a particular company. Eve J. distinguished his decision in Drummond\u2019s case and held the trust then before him valid, being of opinion that the class of beneficiaries was sufficiently defined as a section of the public to support the gift. Although Lord Wrenbury\u2019s judgment in Verge v. Somerville[22] was delivered in 1924, it was not until 1945 that the decsion in Rayner\u2019s case was over-ruled by the Court of Appeal in In Re Compton, supra. In the meantime, the will of the testator here in question was executed.\nBy 1948 when the will of the testatrix was executed, In Re Hobourn[23], had been decided, although Gibson v. South American Stores[24], and Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust[25], had not. However, whatever may have been the view of the professional advisers of either the testator or the testatrix when the respective wills now in question were executed, the appellant does not argue now that the trusts here in question can be supported in law except as trusts for the relief of poverty. For the reason already given, the necessary foundation for such an argument does not exist upon the construction of the language used by the testators which, in my view, is the proper construction.\nWith respect to the argument that there is a whole field of \u201cindirect\u201d benefit left open within which the trust may validly operate, we have not the benefit of the view of either of the courts below, as this contention was for the first time put forward in this court. This argument is, of course, founded upon the use of the word \u201cdirectly\u201d.\nIt is contended that while the testator has prohibited the application of any part of the income for the direct benefit of an individual who does not fall within the specified class, the will permits the income to be applied to such objects as, for example, a hospital, as it is said, such a gift involves only indirect benefit, presumably, to the patients.\nHad the testator stopped with the words \u201cThe Canada Life Assurance Company\u201d where those words are used for the second time in the first limb of the paragraph, there might be considerable force in this contention. The testator, however, did not stop there, but went on to prescribe in the second limb that, \u201csubject to the foregoing restrictions\u201d, the application of the income, including\n(a) \u201cthe amounts to be expended\u201d and\n(b) \u201cthe persons to benefit therefrom\u201d (and here the word \u201cdirectly\u201d does not occur)\nshould be determined by the Board of Directors.\nIt is to be observed that while it is the trustees who are to disburse the income, it is the directors who are to control the application of the payments. The word \u201cpersons\u201d in (b) above certainly does not exclude individuals. It includes them. If, therefore, according to the appellant\u2019s contention, no individual may take a direct benefit, the directors could never, as the testator directs, determine the \u201cpersons\u201d to benefit but only at best, the \u201cclasses of persons\u201d who might be served by any particular institution or organization to which they might direct payments to be made. The Canada Life employees and their dependents are themselves a class but the testator has declared that even among that class, the selection of the actual beneficiaries is a matter for the directors.\nHaving imperatively prescribed that the \u201cpersons\u201d to benefit shall be determined by the directors, the testator has made it clear, in my opinion, that it is individuals and not institutions or organizations that he had in mind. Accordingly, as a gift to or for the benefit of an individual must benefit that individual directly, I think that in prescribing in the second limb of the paragraph that \u201cthe persons to benefit therefrom\u201d are to be determined by the directors, he has removed any ambiguity there might otherwise have arisen upon the phrase \u201cthe persons to benefit directly\u201d in the earlier language. The testator had in mind I think, in the employment of the earlier language that while a gift to or for the benefit of a member of the specified class would involve direct benefit to him, it might, in many cases, also involve indirect benefit to others, e.g., relatives of the beneficiary. In making their selections from that class, however, the directors will be concerned only with persons to be directly benefited.\nI therefore think that the testator has devoted the income for \u201ccharitable purposes\u201d among the persons of the class which he has himself described, to the exclusion of all others. Accordingly, while the opening language of the paragraph \u201cto pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only\u201d, taken alone, could not well be broader for the purpose of expressing a general charitable intention, the language which follows makes it clear, in my opinion, that the testator had no general charitable intention but an intention that the income should be used for charitable purposes for the benefit only of the persons he specifies and for no one else. If this be the true view, the court is not in a position to apply the gift in any other way upon the failure of the testator\u2019s gift.\nI think the case at bar is within the principle of In Re Wilson[26], rather than within In Re Monk[27]. In National Anti-vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[28], Lord Simonds, in dealing with the doctrine of general charitable intention, said at p. 64:\nIt would be very relevant, if the society, conceding that the campaign against vivisection was not a charitable purpose, argued that there was yet a general charitable intention and that its funds were applicable to some other charitable purpose. That is not the argument. If it were, I should not entertain it, though it might in an earlier age have succeeded.\nI would use the same language in the present case, and would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The late Herbert Coplin Cox provided in his will that the residue of his estate should be held by his trustees upon trust (As to which see p. 96).\nHis widow, the late Louise Bogart Cox, included an identical provision in her will and both have been considered in this litigation. As a matter of convenience only the will of Herbert Coplin Cox will be referred to hereafter.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the judgment of Mr. Justice Wells and held that the foregoing provision did not constitute a valid charitable trust or, as stated by Mr. Justice Roach, writing the judgment of the Court:\n... These trusts are not trusts for general public purposes; they are trusts for private individuals, a fluctuating body of private individuals but still private individuals. Because they are not for public purposes they are not charitable and are therefore void as offending the rule against perpetuities. Counsel for the appellant contends that the judgment of Mr. Justice Wells should be restored, declaring that the foregoing provision of the will constitutes a valid charitable bequest for the relief of poverty and, with respect to public benefit, he submits:\nThe rule is either that the element of public benefit must be present in every category of legal charity except in the case of trusts for relief of poverty; or that a trust for the relief of poverty of a class of persons per se creates a public benefit.\nIt is convenient first to consider how far public benefit is essential in the creation of a valid charitable trust. Charitable purposes and objects have been classified by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel\u2019s case[29], under four headings. These are trusts for (a) the relief of poverty; (b) the advancement of education; (c) the advancement of religion and (d) other purposes beneficial to the community not falling under any of the preceding heads.\nIn Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld.,[30], securities were left upon trust to apply the income\nin providing for or assisting in providing for the education of children of employees or former employees of British-American Tobacco Co. Ld. \u2026 or any of its subsidiary or allied companies in such manner and according to such schemes or rules or regulations as the acting trustees shall in their absolute discretion from time to time think fit\u2026\nIn the House of Lords it was held that this trust for educational purposes was invalid because the beneficiaries were limited to the children of employees of specified companies and, therefore, did not constitute a section of the community. Lord Simonds, at p. 306, stated:\nA group of persons may be numerous but, if the nexus between them is their personal relationship to a single propositus or to several propositi, they are neither the community nor a section of the community for charitable purposes.\nI come, then, to the present case where the class of beneficiaries is numerous but the difficulty arises in regard to their common and distinguishing quality. That quality is being children of employees of one or other of a group of companies. I can make no distinction between children of employees and the employees themselves. In both cases the common quality is found in employment by particular employers.\nIn the foregoing quotation Lord Simonds, with whom Lord Oaksey and Lord Morton of Henryton agree, makes it plain that it is not the number of beneficiaries that constitutes the test, but that however large the number, if the nexus between them is their personal relationship to a single propositus such as The Canada Life Assurance Company, they do not constitute a section of the community and, therefore, the trust is invalid, not being for a public benefit.\nIn Gilmour v. Coats[31], the House of Lords emphasized the same requirement of public benefit in order that a valid charitable trust for religious purposes may exist. The Privy Council emphasized the same requirement in relation to a trust falling under classification (d) (for other purposes beneficial to the community) in Verge v. Somerville[32], where Lord Wrenbury stated at p. 499:\nTo ascertain whether a gift constitutes a valid charitable trust so as to escape being void on the ground of perpetuity, a first inquiry must be whether it is public\u2014whether it is for the benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the community. The inhabitants of a parish or town, or any particular class of such inhabitants, may, for instance, be the objects of such a gift, but private individuals, or a fluctuating body of private individuals, cannot.\nThe Oppenheim, Gilmour and Verge cases make it clear that public benefit must at least be found in charities classified under (b), (c) and (d) of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classification; further that the Oppenheim case makes it equally plain that in specifying the employees of The Canada Life Assurance Company and their dependents the testator had not created a trust for public benefit.\nCounsel for the appellant, however, contends that public benefit is not essential to the creation of a trust under Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classification (a) (for the relief of poverty).\nTrusts for the relief of poor and needy relatives, usually described as the \u201cpoor relations\u201d cases, have at least since 1754 (Isaac v. de Friez[33]), been held to be valid in courts of first instance and the Court of Appeal in England. These have been treated, in the Court of Appeal and in so far as they have been referred to in the House of Lords, as exceptions to the general rule that public benefit must be found in order that a charitable trust may be valid. (See Lord Simonds in the Oppenheim case, supra, at 308). There is also, in the Court of Appeal in England, a second exception to this general rule, of which Gibson v. South American Stores Ld.[34], is an illustration. In that case the trust was for the benefit of those\nwho are or shall be necessitous and deserving and who, for the time being, are or have been in the company\u2019s employ ... and the wives, widows, husbands, widowers, children, parents, and other dependants of any person who, for the time being, is, or would if living have been, himself or herself a member of the class of beneficiaries.\nThe foregoing provision was held to be for the relief of poverty and the requirement of public benefit was raised by the Master of the Rolls at p. 191:\nUnder the law as it has now been established, and in the light of its several recent decisions both in this court and in the House of Lords, is a trust for a class of poor persons defined by reference to the fact that they are employed by some person, firm or company, a good charitable trust, or does it fail of that qualification through the absence of the necessary public element?\nThe Master of the Rolls, after recognizing the \u201cpoor relations\u201d cases as an exception or an anomaly, appeared to regard the decisions in Spiller v. Maude[35], In re Buck,[36], and In re Gosling[37], as constituting another exception to the rule requiring that in a valid trust public benefit must be found. In each of these cases the fund was held to have been created expressly for the benefit of poverty and the fact that the beneficiaries must be selected from an association or company did not prevent its being a valid charity. The learned Master of the Rolls, in appreciation of the fact that the issue in the foregoing oases had never been before the House of Lords, recognized the possibility that it might be otherwise decided in that House. He, however, without in any way discussing the principles involved, felt bound by the unreported judgment of the Court of Appeal in 1935, Re Sir Robert Laidlaw[38], of which no reasons were available. In his own words:\nI think that, so far as I am concerned, this question has been determined by In re Sir Robert Laidlaw, on grounds which are not apparent, and I loyally follow them without affirming or disaffirming any of the grounds relied on by Harman J.\nHe, therefore, held the trust valid and the same position was taken by that court in Re Coulthurst[39]. The case at bar, however, does not come within either of the foregoing exceptions. It could not, nor has it been suggested that it falls within the \u201cpoor relations\u201d group. Then, with respect to the second exception or group, illustrated by the Gibson case, supra, it must be observed that all of the cases that have been included thereunder were specifically created for the relief of poverty and no other charitable purpose. This is not such a case. The language here, without enumerating them, includes all the classifications as made by Lord Macnaghten, which, of course, would include poverty. Even if this exception should ultimately become established in the law, it ought not to be so far extended as to include a trust for all charitable purposes such as that here under consideration.\nThe fact that the \u201cpoor relations\u201d cases and the group illustrated by the Gibson case, supra, have been treated as exceptions to the general rule that a charitable trust must be not only charitable in character but for a public benefit indicates that the general rule requiring public benefit is applicable to trusts for the relief of poverty. Moreover, that such is the correct view is strengthened by the statements to be found in the authorities and text books, of which the following may be noted:\nLord Simonds:\n\u2026 the principle has been consistently maintained, that a trust in order to be charitable must be of a public character. It must not be merely for the benefit of particular private individuals: if it is, it will not be in law a charity though the benefit taken by those individuals is of the very character stated in the preamble. Williams\u2019 Trustees v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[40].\nLord Porter in National Anti-Vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[41], stated:\nOne must take it therefore that in whichever of the four classes the matter may fall, it cannot be a charity unless it is beneficial to the community or to some sufficiently defined portion of it.\nSee also Lord Wright at p. 42.\nThen (again the learned authors of Tudor on Charities, 5th Ed., p. 11, state:\nIn the first place it may be laid down as a universal rule that the law recognizes no purpose as charitable unless it is of a public character. That is to say, a purpose must, in order to be charitable, be directed to the benefit of the community or a section of the community. Whether public benefit exists in a given case is a question of fact. In National Anti\u2011Vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, supra, the House of Lords adopted the view expressed by Russell J. (as he then was) in Re Hummeltenberg[42]. Lord Wright, at p. 44, adopts the language of Russell J.:\nIn my opinion, the question whether a gift is or may be operative for the public benefit is a question to be answered by the court by forming an opinion upon the evidence before it.\nand expressly approves of it. At p. 42 Lord Wright states:\nThe test of benefit to the community goes through the whole of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classification, though as regards the first three heads, it may be prima facie assumed unless the contrary appears.\nLord Simonds stated at p. 65:\nI will readily concede that, if the purpose is within one of the heads of charity forming the first three classes in the classification which Lord Macnaghten borrowed from Sir Samuel Romilly\u2019s argument in Morice v. Bishop of Durham[43], the court will easily conclude that it is a charitable purpose. But even here to give the purpose the name of \u201creligious\u201d or \u201ceducation\u201d is not to conclude the matter. It may yet not be charitable, if the religious purpose is illegal or the educational purpose is contrary to public policy. Still there remains the overriding question: \u2018Is it pro bono publico? It would be another strange misreading of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s speech in Pemsel\u2019s case[44], (one was pointed out in In re Macduff[45]), to suggest that he intended anything to the contrary. I would rather say that, when a purpose appears broadly to fall within one of the familiar categories of charity, the court will assume it to be for the benefit of the community and, therefore, charitable, unless the contrary is shown, and further that the court will not be astute in such a case to defeat on doubtful evidence the avowed benevolent intention of a donor.\nIf, therefore, upon the face of the document, the purpose or object of the trust is charitable in character, public benefit may be assumed or prima facie established, but where, as here, upon the face of the document it is clear that the cestuis que trust are limited to those who are employees of a particular company and their dependents, public benefit is negatived and, therefore, that element essential to a valid charitable trust is absent.\nThe appellant further contends that the provision of the will above quoted should be construed to mean that the employees and their dependents were to benefit to the extent that the trust might be declared valid, or, as otherwise stated, the testator discloses an intention that the fund should be used for such charitable purpose or purposes as are legal within the named group. If, therefore, the absence of public benefit made the trust invalid under headings (b), (c) and (d) of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s classification, it would still remain a valid charitable trust under (a) for the relief of poverty. This contention, if maintained, would involve a consideration of the Gibson case, supra. However, in my view, the provision does not admit of such a construction. It would appear that the testator, in providing that the directors might expend the income for charitable purposes, included the relief of poverty, in the same sense that all other purposes and objects are included, and made it abundantly clear that the employees and their dependents should benefit, not only in case of financial need, but in any manner that might be included within the phrase \u201ccharitable purposes.\u201d Moreover, it cannot be concluded that the testator would not have been mindful of the fact that the directors would probably find it difficult to expend the fund for the relief of poverty only among the employees and their dependents.\nThere remains the further contention that, though the trust for the employees and their dependents may be invalid, the testator has, in the foregoing provision, disclosed a general charitable intention which should be administered cy-pr\u00e8s. This involves a difficult question of construction. As stated by Lord Davey in Hunter v. Attorney-General[46]:\nYou must construe the words of the will fairly, and if you can find a charitable purpose sufficiently clearly expressed the Court will give effect to it. If you do not find any such definite expression, you are not at liberty to supply it from more or less well-founded speculation of what the testator would probably have wished or intended if his attention had been drawn to the omission.\nAs Kay J. stated in Re Taylor; Martin v. Freeman,[47]:\nI take the line to be a very clear one; perhaps sometimes it is difficult to say on which side of the line a particular case comes; but the line, which we all very well understand, is one of this nature: if upon the whole scope and intent of the will you discern the paramount object of the testator was to benefit not a particular institution, but to effect a particular form of charity independently of any special institution or mode, then, although he may have indicated the mode in which he desires that to be carried out, you are to regard the primary paramount intention chiefly, and if the particular mode for any reason fails, the court, if it sees a sufficient expression of a general intention of charity, will, to use the phrase familiar to us, execute that cy-pr\u00e8s, that is, carry-out the general paramount intention in some way as nearly as possible the same as that which the testator has particularly indicated without which his intention itself cannot be effectuated.\nThe testator, under his will, provided for relatives and friends by way of legacies and annuities and then set up the foregoing trust for the employees of the company over which he presided as president and their dependents. When read as a whole, the will rather supports the view that the testator intended to benefit only these groups.\nIt is, however, contended that in the paragraph creating this trust he discloses a general charitable intention. The opening words \u201cTo pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only,\u201d if they stood alone, would disclose a charitable intention. However, these words are but a part of the sentence creating the trust which must be read and construed as a whole. The phrase \u201csubject to the foregoing restrictions\u201d refers to both the limitation \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d and the restriction of the benefit to the employees and their dependents. The testator appears here to place these two first portions of the provision upon an equal basis. Moreover, there is but one income and when, in that provision, he provides \u201cthe application of such income \u2026 shall be determined by the Board of Directors ... in their absolute discretion\u201d he uses the phrase \u201csuch income\u201d to refer back to the word \u201cincome\u201d as it is first used in this sentence. It would appear, therefore, that the testator contemplated the directors would expend the entire income upon charitable purposes, but for the benefit of the employees and their dependents.\nThe testator, throughout this paragraph, provides for the employees and their dependents in such a manner that they may benefit in any way that may be within the limits of charitable purposes. In a sentence so constructed it seems impossible to give to any part thereof a separate and distinct significance such as that here suggested.\nThe word \u201conly\u201d is twice used in this sentence and in both instances it adds nothing to the meaning except in so far as it may emphasize the intention of the testator. It is, however, stressed that the insertion of the word \u201cdirectly\u201d in the phrase \u201cthe persons to benefit directly in pursuance of such charitable purposes ...\u201d imports that the testator had in mind that the employees and their dependents would benefit directly but that some others or other groups might benefit indirectly, which could only be accomplished by interpreting the provision as disclosing a general charitable intention. Even if a general charitable intention be found, it does not follow that the beneficiaries would benefit indirectly. The word \u201cdirectly\u201d is not a word of art and, while in another context it might well support such a contention, as here used it merely emphasizes the testator\u2019s intention to directly benefit the employees and their dependents.\nWhile the word \u201cgeneral\u201d is not essential to disclose a general charitable intention, its absence in a provision by a testator given to using words of emphasis is significant where, as here, in the same sentence he sets forth his purpose, object and the names of the cestuis que trust. Further, the disposition of this residue, having regard to the variety of benefits and the number of beneficiaries, does not suggest any surplus and it cannot be assumed that the testator had any doubt as to the validity of the trust he was creating. The provision read as a whole does not disclose that the testator\u2019s paramount object was to benefit charity generally, but rather to benefit the employees and their dependents. In other words, in the language here used one cannot, to use the language of Lord Davey, \u201cfind a charitable purpose sufficiently clearly expressed.\u201d\nThe variation in para. 5 of the judgment of Wells J., relative to the will of Herbert Coplin Cox, as inserted in the Court of Appeal order, should be altered as set out by my brother Kerwin. The appeals should be dismissed. The costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate, those of the surviving administrator with the will annexed and trustee of the testator\u2019s will and codicil as between solicitor and client.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014These two appeals were argued together.\nThe late Herbert Coplin Cox died on September 17, 1947, leaving a will dated June 25, 1938. His widow, Louise Bogart Cox, died on November 18, 1948, leaving a will dated November 2, 1948. The questions to be determined arise out of the residuary clauses contained in these wills. These are substantially identical in wording and it was common ground that the result should be the same in both appeals. It will therefore be necessary to consider only the residuary clause contained in the will of Mr. Cox. It reads as follows:\u2014\nSUBJECT as hereinbefore provided, and with respect to the balance of my residuary estate which may remain in my Trustees\u2019 possession, my said Trustees shall hold same upon trust as follows: (The trust is set out at p. 96).\nThe trustees moved on originating notice for the determination of a number of questions, but it was agreed when the motion came on for hearing before Wells J. that he should deal only with the question whether the disposition made in the residuary clause quoted above is a valid charitable bequest, and that upon the final determination of that question the matter should be referred back to the Weekly Court for further consideration.\nEvidence was received of the following matters:\u2014(i) that the number of persons in existence at the date of the hearing before Wells J. who would answer the description of employees, past or present, of the Canada Life Assurance Company and dependents of such employees was estimated to be somewhat in excess of thirty thousand, (ii) that a number of these were in such straitened circumstances as to need financial aid, (iii) that the known next-of-kin of Mr. Cox were of the fourth degree, and (iv) that the known next-of-kin of Mrs. Cox were of the fifth degree. It is stated in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal that the residuary estate of Mr. Cox amounts to about $500,000 and that of Mrs. Cox to about $200,000.\nCounsel appeared for the trustees of the wills, for the directors of the Canada Life Assurance Company, for the known next-of-kin, for the present appellant who was appointed in each case to represent the employees of the Canada Life Assurance Company, for the Public Trustee who was appointed to represent such other persons as might benefit under the residuary clause in question and for the Official Guardian who was appointed to represent any unascertained persons who might be interested in the residue in the event of an intestacy.\nWells J. decided that the clause in question \u201cis a valid charitable bequest for the relief of poverty\u201d. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of Wells J., declared that the clause does not constitute a valid charitable bequest and that it is therefore void as offending the rule against perpetuities and ordered a reference to the Master at Toronto to determine and report as to who are the next\u2011of\u2011kin of Mr. Cox and Mrs. Cox respectively.\nOn appeal to this Court, counsel for the appellant asked that the judgment of Wells J. should be restored and alternatively supported the argument of counsel for the Public Trustee. Counsel for the Board of Directors of The Canada Life Assurance Company adopted the argument of counsel for the appellant. Counsel for the trustees of the wills submitted the rights of the trustees to the Court but \u201csuggested\u201d that the judgment of Wells J. should be restored. For the Public Trustee it was contended that the clause is a valid charitable bequest as it stands and is not restricted to the relief of poverty but that if this is not accepted there is a valid bequest for charitable purposes generally and if the particular mode prescribed for carrying such purposes into effect fails, in whole or in part, the general charitable intention should be executed cy-pr\u00e8s. Counsel for the next-of-kin and for the Official Guardian supported the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt will be convenient first to summarize the reasons which brought Wells J. and the Court of Appeal to their respective conclusions.\nEarly in his reasons Wells J. says:\u2014\nIn the case at bar, however, the payment of income is limited \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d and I think there can be no question that this gift must be deemed to be for any of the four purposes which the authorities have laid down as compendiously describing charitable trusts.\nLater, after quoting from the judgment in The Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax v. Pemsel[48], where Lord Macnaghten speaks of the four principal divisions which \u201cCharity\u201d in its legal sense comprises, the learned judge continues:\u2014\nAs I have said, I must assume that all these four heads were intended to be included by these two testators in the phrase used by them to denote the purpose for which the residue of their assets was to be left, that is \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d. He then proceeds to the inquiry whether the trust is public\u2014whether it is for the benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the community. After an examination of numerous authorities, including Gilmour v. Coats[49], In re Gosling[50], In re Drummond[51], In re Rayner[52], In re Compton[53], In re Hobourn Aero Components Limited\u2019s Air Raid Distress Fund[54], and Gibson v. South American Stores[55], the learned judge concludes that it has been decided by the Court of Appeal in England that a trust for the relief of poverty amongst the employees and ex-employees of a company and their families is a valid charitable trust. He proceeds:\u2014\n... The charitable objects which are roughly gathered together under the words \u201crelief of poverty\u201d and which include the various items originally set out in the statute of Elizabeth and those of a similar nature are included in my view in the general words used by the testators when they provided that the income from the residue of their estates was to be paid over for charitable purposes only. Despite the very cogent argument addressed to me on behalf of some of the next-of-kin I must find that these testators had a general charitable intent which they have expressed without any ambiguity and that included in this intent was the division of charitable trusts which has been described as trusts for the relief of poverty. Under the exception which I have noted in the decisions the fact that the group intended to be benefited is defined by and depends upon a personal relationship either at first or second hand to the Corporation in which both the testators have been interested in their lifetime, does not preclude me from holding as I think I should under the authorities that in each of the wills before me there is a valid charitable bequest for the relief of poverty. But I must hold that the bequest is limited to this head of charitable relief. I do so realizing that the result is not a satisfactory one in the particular circumstances of this case but I am bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal of England in a matter of this sort unless there are contrary decisions of our own Court of Appeal and none have been cited to me nor have I found any.\nThe unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Roach J.A.[56] who, after reviewing the authorities dealt with by Wells J. and the decision of the House of Lords in Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ltd.[57], decided after Wells J. had given judgment, says in part:\u2014\nThe trusts with which we are here concerned are \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d. That phrase necessarily includes all legal charities. The law is now definitely settled by as high authority as the House of Lords\u2014the Oppenheim case\u2014that to the extent that those purposes include the charities coming within the second, third and fourth divisions of charities as classified by Lord Macnaghten these trusts are not valid charitable trusts because the beneficiaries are limited to a group of individuals who are defined by reference to propositi named by the donor in each case. Wells J. reached that conclusion but he held that they were valid charitable trusts limited to the relief of poverty among the beneficiaries. In my opinion they are not legal charitable trusts even for that purpose.\nClearly they do not come within the \u201cpoor relations cases\u201d. Those cases constitute a class of anomalous decisions which are now regarded as good law only because of their respectable antiquity.\nIn the Oppenheim case Lord Morton of Henryton suggested that such a case as the Gibson case\u2014the case at bar resembles it to the extent that the purposes of the trusts here in question include the relief of poverty\u2014might be described as a descendant of the \u201cpoor relations cases\u201d. In this Province, at least, and I should think also in England the \u201cpoor relations cases\u201d as a class constitute a closed class and no other case not entirely identical with the poor relation cases should be legally adopted into that class.\nSince that class is closed then the trusts here in question can be valid charitable trusts only if there is a second exception to the general rule, namely, trusts for the relief of poverty among a group of private individuals who are chosen by the donor by reason of another type of personal relationship, namely, their relationship as employees or dependents of employees of a named employer.\nIn my opinion this Court should hold that in this Province there is not such an exception to the general rule. The test as laid down in In re Compton and approved and applied in the Oppenheim case to an educational trust should also be the test to be applied in a trust for the relief of poverty. I can see no reason why it should be applied in the one but not in the other.\nWhile the learned Justice of Appeal points out the distinction between the case at bar and Gibson v. South American Stores (supra), that in the former the relief of poverty is included in the purposes of the trust while in the latter poverty was a necessary element to qualify a person for benefit (vide Gibson v. South American Stores (supra) at 187), it would appear from the quotation from his reasons above, and particularly the last paragraph thereof, that even had the facts of the two cases been identical he would have refused to follow the Gibson case.\nRoach J.A. does not in his reasons examine the argument of the Public Trustee as to the application of the cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine. Early in his reasons, after stating the facts, he says:\u2014\nIf the trust in question in each estate is not a valid charitable trust, it is void as offending the rule against perpetuities and a partial intestacy will result. In my view, the first step to be taken in an endeavour to solve the problem presented to us is to construe the words of the clause in question, bearing in mind the rule that for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the testator the will is read, in the first place, without reference to or regard to the consequences of any rule of law, the rules of law being applied to the intention thus collected in order to see whether the court is at liberty to carry the intention into effect (vide Halsbury 2nd Edition, Volume 34, page 189 and cases there cited). The clause first directs that the trustees shall hold the residue upon trust:\u2014\u201cTo pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only;\u201d. Pausing here, I can not think of any words more apt to indicate a general charitable intention. The clause proceeds, not to prescribe in any detail the mode in which this charitable intention is to be carried into effect but to confer on the Board of Directors of the Canada Life Assurance Company, subject only to two restrictions, an absolute discretion as to the application of the income, \u201cincluding the amounts to be expended and the persons to benefit therefrom\u201d. The absolute discretion so given is stated to be \u201csubject to the foregoing restrictions\u201d. What then are these restrictions? They are, first, that the income is to be paid \u201cfor charitable purposes only\u201d and, second, that \u201cthe persons to benefit directly in pursuance of such charitable purposes are to be only such as shall be or shall have been employees of The Canada Life Assurance Company and\/or the dependents of such employees\u201d. The usual and ordinary meaning of the words of the clause does not appear to me to differ from their literal meaning and I can find no ambiguity in the clause. It provides (i) that the income is to be used forever for charitable purposes only (ii) subject to this and to one further restriction an unfettered discretion is given to the Board of Directors of the Canada Life Assurance Company to direct the manner of its application (iii) the further restriction referred to is that the charitable purposes selected by the Board shall be such that direct benefits shall be conferred only upon members of a class made up of the present and past employees of the Canada Life Assurance Company and the dependents of such employees. I can find nothing in the words used to suggest that poverty is a necessary element to qualify any member of the class mentioned for benefit. While the clause forbids the conferring of direct benefits upon persons outside the class it does not require that direct benefits shall be conferred upon any of its members. The Board is left free, if it sees fit, to devote all the income to charitable purposes which confer only indirect benefits. The discretion given to the Board is no doubt a fiduciary discretion which must be exercised bona fide (vide the observations of the Master of the Rolls in Gibson v. South American Stores (supra) at page 185) but apart from this it is subject only to the two restrictions above referred to.\nThe next, and, as it appears to me, more difficult question is whether the restriction referred to, i.e., \u201cthe persons to benefit directly in pursuance of such charitable purposes are to be only such as shall be or shall have been employees of The Canada Life Assurance Company and\/or the dependents of such employees\u201d, is valid.\nA considerable portion of the full and able arguments addressed to us on this branch of the matter proceeded as if the question were whether a perpetual trust to use the income of the fund for charitable purposes only and for the benefit only of members of the class mentioned would be a valid charitable trust. That is not the precise point before us, as, if my view as to the construction of the clause is correct, it is only in the case of direct benefits that the application of the income is confined to members of the class, but a consideration of it may be of assistance. I do not propose to attempt a review of the numerous authorities so fully discussed in the judgments below and in the recent decisions in England, above referred to. With respect, it appears to me that the present state of the law in England on this point is accurately summarized by Jenkins L.J. in In re Scarisbrick[58], at page 648 et seq, as follows:\n... (i) It is a general rule that a trust or gift in order to be charitable in the legal sense must be for the benefit of the public or some section of the public; See In re Compton[59], In re Hobourn Aero Components Ld.\u2019s. Air Raid Distress Fund,[60] and Gilmour v. Coats[61].\n(ii) An aggregate of individuals ascertained by reference to some personal tie (e.g. of blood or contract), such as the relations of a particular individual, the members of a particular family, the employees of a particular firm, the members of a particular association, does not amount to the public or a section thereof for the purposes of the general rule: see In re Drummond[62], In re Compton[63], In re Hobourn Aero Components Ld.\u2019s Air Raid Distress Fund[64], and Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld.[65]\n(iii) It follows that according to the general rule above stated a trust or gift under which the beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries are confined to some aggregate of individuals ascertained as above is not legally charitable even though its purposes are such that it would have been legally charitable if the range of potential beneficiaries had extended to the public at large or a section thereof (e.g., an educational trust confined as In re Compton, to the lawful descendants of three named persons, or, as in Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld. to the children of employees or former employees of a particular company).\n(iv) There is, however, an exception to the general rule, in that trusts or gifts for the relief of poverty have been held to be charitable even though they are limited in their application to some aggregate of individuals ascertained as above, and are therefore not trusts or gifts for the benefit of the public or a section thereof. This exception operates whether the personal tie is one of blood (as in the numerous so-called \u201cpoor relations\u201d cases, to some of which I will presently refer) or of contract (e.g., the relief of poverty amongst the members of a particular society, as in Spiller v. Maude[66], or amongst employees of a particular company or their dependants, as in Gibson v. South American Stores (Gath and Chaves) Ld.[67]\n(v) This exception cannot be accounted for by reference to any principle, but is established by a series of authorities of long standing, and must at the present date be accepted as valid, at all events as far as this court is concerned (see In re Compton63) though doubtless open to review in the House of Lords (as appears from the observations of Lords Simonds and Morton of Henryton) in Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust Co. Ld.65\nIf, in the case at bar, the clause in question required the income to be used for the relief of poverty among the class described it would fall within the fourth proposition stated by Jenkins L.J. and it would be necessary for us to decide whether we should accept this proposition, as Wells J. did, or reject it, as the Court of Appeal did; but, as I have already indicated, I am unable to so construe the clause.\nI should here mention one of Mr. Robinette\u2019s arguments in support of the view that the clause should be construed as limiting the application of the income to the relief of poverty. It is said that the clause imperatively requires the income to be devoted in perpetuity to charitable purposes, that this must mean charitable purposes in the legal sense, that the testator has not specified any particular charitable purposes but, insofar as direct benefits are concerned, has defined with precision the class for whose benefit the income is to be applied, and that it must therefore be taken that he intended the income to be used for such purposes only as the law recognizes as charitable in regard to the defined class. This argument is necessarily based on the assumption that we should accept and follow the decision in Gibson v. South American Stores (supra) and for the purpose of the argument I will assume, without deciding, that we should do so. The learned judge of first instance appears to have accepted this argument which provides a reconciliation of the passages first above quoted from his reasons, to the effect that all of the four principal divisions of charity were intended to be included by the testator in the purposes for which the income from the residue was to be applied, with the final conclusion, also quoted above, that the bequest is limited to the relief of poverty. Not without hesitation I have reached the conclusion that this argument should not prevail. In my opinion the exception to the general rule set out in the fourth proposition stated by Jenkins L.J. is restricted to trusts in which the quality of poverty is made an essential condition of eligibility for benefit and should not be extended to cases where the trust permits income to be applied to any of the four principal divisions of charity; nor should such an extension be effected by construing words in a trust instrument which in their ordinary and natural meaning in no way restrict the application of the income to the relief of poverty as if they imposed such a restriction merely by reason of the fact that there is a clear direction that the income is to be used for charitable purposes only.\nIn my opinion the restriction is invalid because the class to which direct benefits are restricted (in the words of Jenkins L.J., quoted above) \u201cdoes not amount to the public or a section thereof\u201d. The restriction is therefore ineffective to either require or permit the trustees to confine the direct benefits of the trust to the class defined, that is, such persons \u201cas shall be or shall have been employees of The Canada Life Assurance Company and\/or the dependents of such employees\u201d. It is next necessary to consider the effect of holding the restriction ineffective. In his reasons already quoted the learned judge of first instance says: \u201cI must find that these testators had a general charitable intent which they have expressed without any ambiguity.\u201d I have already indicated that I share this view. As is pointed out by Sargant L.J. in In re Monk, Giffen v. Wedd[68], it is now well settled that the question whether there is a general charitable intent is one depending on the construction of the particular will or other instrument. In the same case at page 204 Lord Hanworth M.R. says:\u2014\nThe authority of the judgment of Parker J. in In re Wilson[69] is invoked, where he defines broadly two categories into which the cases decided may be divided. The first where \u201cit is possible, taking the will as a whole, to say that, notwithstanding the form of the gift, the paramount intention, according to the true construction of the will, is to give the property in the first instance for a general charitable purpose rather than a particular charitable purpose, and to graft on to the general gift a direction as to the desires or intentions of the testator as to the manner in which the general gift is to be carried into effect.\u201d In such cases, even though the precise directions cannot be carried out, the gift for the general charitable purposes will remain, and be perfectly good, and the doctrine of cy-pr\u00e8s applied. The other category is, \u201cwhere, on the true construction of the will, no such paramount general intention can be inferred, and where the gift, being in the form a particular gift\u2014a gift for a particular purpose\u2014and it being impossible to carry out that particular purpose, the whole gift is held to fail.\u201d Parker J. concludes with the statement of his opinion that the question whether a particular case falls within the one or the other of the above categories is simply a question of the construction of the particular instrument.\nIn the case of In re Wilson, referred to by Lord Hanworth, Parker J. says that in this class of cases \u201cdifferent minds may very well take different views\u201d. To my mind it seems plain that in the case at bar the testator has indicated the paramount intention of giving the whole income from the residue of his estate to charity. This is expressed in the opening words of the clause:\u2014\u201cTo pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only.\u201d All that follows in the clause is, in my view, a direction as to the manner in which the testator intends \u201csuch charitable purposes\u201d to be carried into effect. The question being one of the construction of this particular will, only limited assistance can be derived from an examination of what Sargant L.J. refers to as \u201cthe long bead-roll of cases on the subject\u201d but I have not found a case in which a will contained an express direction that income should be used for charitable purposes only in which it was held that there was not a general charitable intention. If the matter were doubtful it would be necessary to remember, as is pointed out by Lord Hanworth in In re Monk[70] at page 207, \u201cthat the Court leans in favour of a charitable purpose.\u201d I wish to make it clear that my view that the will indicates a general charitable intention is not dependent on the effect which I think must be given to the word \u201cdirectly\u201d in construing the clause in question. If, contrary to my view, the words of the clause following the words \u201cTo pay the income thereof in perpetuity for charitable purposes only\u201d should be construed as confining all benefits from the trust to members of the defined class it would still be my opinion that the will read as a whole indicates a paramount intention to devote all the residue to charity. The impression which I gather from reading the whole of Mr. Cox\u2019s will (and the same is true as to the will of Mrs. Cox) is that the testator has, with care and in considerable detail, provided for all those persons whom he regarded as having a claim upon his bounty, that he has then addressed himself to the question of how he shall dispose of the considerable residue remaining, that he has decided to devote it in perpetuity to charitable purposes, that he has said so in the clearest terms, and then has gone on to direct the method of its application. That method failing, the general intention to devote the residue to charity remains.\nOnce it has been decided as a matter of construction that there is a general charitable intention it is clear that such intention will not be allowed to fail. The question arises, however, whether it should be left to the Trustees of the will to apply the income under the direction of the Board of Directors of The Canada Life Assurance Company in accordance with the clause with the invalid restriction deleted or whether the Court should direct the income to be applied cy-pr\u00e8s. While I think that the intention of the testator to confer direct benefits on members of the class mentioned, to be selected by the Board, to the exclusion, so far as direct benefits are concerned, of all who are not members of the class cannot be given effect, there would remain numerous ways in which the trust could be fully executed by applying the income to charitable purposes which, while highly beneficial to the public, produce indirect benefits only, such as, for example, reduction of the National Debt, the support of schools, or contribution to what are commonly termed \u201cCommunity Chests\u201d; but, reading the will as a whole, I find no reason to suppose that the testator would have forbidden the conferring of direct benefits except in furtherance of his intention to afford them to members of the defined class, which last-mentioned intention cannot be given effect. I do not think it can safely be assumed that the testator would have provided as the manner of carrying out his general charitable intention what would remain of the clause after the deletion of the restriction held to be invalid; and I am therefore of opinion that the proper course is to direct a scheme.\nI would allow the appeals, declare that each will discloses a general charitable intention as to the residuary estate but that the mode of carrying such intention into effect provided by the testator and testatrix respectively cannot be carried out, and direct that the matter be referred back to the Weekly Court so that the proper proceedings may be taken for the propounding and settlement of a scheme for the application cy-pr\u00e8s of such residuary estate.\nIn the particular circumstances of this case I would direct that the costs of all parties appearing on each appeal be paid out of the fund in question in each estate, those of the trustees as between solicitor and client, and that the orders as to costs made in the courts below should stand.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.J.
