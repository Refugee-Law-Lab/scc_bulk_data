The King, [1936] S.C.R. 1\nDate: 1936-01-24\nWilliam Fraser and others Appellants;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1936: January 24.\nPresent: Rinfret J. in chambers.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nAppeal\u2014Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Criminal law\u2014 Conflict of judgments\u2014Circumstantial evidence\u2014Rule as to inference of guilt\u2014Section 1025 Cr. C.\nWhen the conviction of an accused is grounded exclusively on circumstantial evidence, the rule acted upon by the decisions of several courts of appeal throughout Canada has been that \u201cin order to \u201cjustify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of any \u201cother reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt\u201d; and when that principle is compared with the principle expounded in this case by the reasons of judgment of the appellate court, it must be held that there exists, between the above decisions and the judgment appealed from, the conflict required by section 1025 of the Criminal Code; and, therefore, leave to appeal to this Court should be granted, as such rule of law is of sufficiently general importance to justify such leave.\nMOTION under section 1025 of the Criminal Code for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellants. Leave to appeal was granted by the judgment now reported\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellants.\nCharles Laurendeau K.C. and James Crankshaw K.C. contra. Rinfret J.\u2014Counsel for the appellants have moved for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), upholding the verdict against the appellants in this matter.\nMy duty is to decide whether the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case in Canada; and, if so, whether the importance of the case justifies the granting of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIt is common ground that the conviction of the appellants was grounded exclusively on circumstantial evidence. In such cases, the rule laid down by Baron Alderson in Hodge\u2019s case[1] may be said to have been generally adopted that\nthe jury must be satisfied not only that (the) circumstances were consistent with his (the prisoner) having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.\nCounsel for the appellants referred me to at least four judgments of other courts of appeal in like cases, where the rule so laid down was accepted and applied. They are: The King v. Jenkins (Court of Appeal for British Columbia)[2]; Rex v. Hyslop (Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta)[3]; Rex v. Yok Yuen (Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario)[4]; Rex v. Demetrio (Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario)[5].\nIt may be added that this Court has also adopted the rule, amongst other instances, in the cases of McLean v. The King[6] and Reinblatt v. The King[7].\nThe result of that rule and of the decisions where it was applied is that\nin order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. (Wills, On Circumstantial Evidence, at p. 262).\nNow, if we take the principle thus enunciated and acted upon by the several courts of appeal throughout Canada in the cases referred to, and if we compare it with the principle expounded in the present case by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), as it must be gathered from the reasons of judgment, it is difficult not to come to the conclusion that there exists between the two the conflict required by section 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nThe learned judge who gave the reasons for the Court expressed himself in the following way:\nAussi bien, les procureurs des appelants se sont-ils appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 mettre de l\u2019avant, pour le cas o\u00f9 le dossier montrerait encore que leurs clients ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, cette r\u00e8gle de droit bien connue qu\u2019une preuve circonstantielle ne doit conduire \u00e0 un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 que si les circonstances entrevues ne s\u2019adaptent pas de fa\u00e7on plausible \u00e0 une autre hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable.\nAs I read this sentence, I do not feel that it lays down the rule in the way in which it has been interpreted by the other courts of appeal in the judgments already mentioned. I think it was put down in a much stronger way than the words of the learned judge convey. The statement\nqu\u2019une preuve circonstantielle ne doit conduire \u00e0 un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 que si les circonstances entrevues ne s\u2019adaptent pas de fa\u00e7on plausible \u00e0 une autre hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable\nis not as favourable to the prisoner as the principle laid down by Baron Alderson[8] that the facts must be\nsuch as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person,\nwhich, by the other courts, have been understood and interpreted to mean that there should be\nno other possible explanation consistent with the evidence, except the guilt of the accused,\nor that the evidence believed by the jury\nmust exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence and justify the verdict.\nBut, if I read further in the reasons of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, my conviction is strengthened that the principle whereby the Court measured the validity of the jury\u2019s verdict in the present case was different from that laid down by Baron Alderson and accepted by the other courts of appeal, for the learned judge says:\nJe veux tenir compte de cette r\u00e8gle bien juste et bien logique, mais peut-on s\u2019y attarder encore, s\u2019il surgit un fait d\u00e9cisif et qui soit de nature \u00e0 dissiper tout doute quant \u00e0 la connaissance du but poursuivi et de l\u2019intention de l\u2019inculp\u00e9, et ainsi rendre incompatible l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019innocence.\nWhat the learned judge says there is that one fact in a chain of circumstances may be found conclusive of a man\u2019s guilt, which is directly contrary to The King v. Jenkins (1).\nThe difference between the two is made still wider when one reads the sentence immediately following, in the reasons of the Court of King\u2019s Bench:\nOn conviendra, je crois, qu\u2019un tel fait, lorsqu\u2019il se produit, doive mettre en \u00e9chec la r\u00e8gle de droit susmentionn\u00e9e.\nTo which may be added the following further statement in the reasons:\nIl est facile de dire qu\u2019il faut, pour convaincre de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 raison d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle, \u00e9carter d\u2019abord toute autre hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable * * * mais si la d\u00e9fense\u2014pas plus au proc\u00e8s qu\u2019en appel\u2014n\u2019a pu en imaginer, comment peut-elle se plaindre que le jury n\u2019en ait vu aucune;\nwhich apparently suggests that it was for the appellants to establish their innocence, and not for the Crown to prove their guilt.\nUnder the circumstances, I am respectfully of opinion that the appellants have proven the existence of the conflict; and the rule itself is of sufficiently general importance to justify me in granting leave to appeal.\nMotion granted.\n[1] (1838) 2 Lewin\u2019s Crown\u2019s Cas. 227.\n[2] (1908) 14 Can.

The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nR. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nF. Heap K.C. and J. R. Crawford for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The invention to which the patent relates, in respect of which the controversy on this appeal arises, is thus described in the appellant's factum:\u2014\nThe means and methods of underpinning buildings covered by the patent provide for the creation of reinforced concrete piers directly under the footings of buildings. This is accomplished by first making a limited excavation under the footing of a building, then by means of a boring tool fitted to a jointed rod and handle, boring a hole downward from such excavation to a firm foundation, and the use of the excavation and hole so created as a forming for the concrete. Reinforcing material is then placed in the hole and excavation as may be required and the whole filled with concrete, and a pier head formed by the filling of the excavation under the footing. When the concrete in the pier and pier head is set, the space of a few inches between the pier head and foundation is filled with concrete tamped in so as to effectually fill the space and take the weight of the foundation.\nThe operators are enabled thus to create such pier working from the side of the wall of the foundation and the shaft of the boring tool is equipped with a guiding member, thus insuring a perfectly vertical hole. This results in the creation of a solid concrete pier being placed vertically under an existing foundation by a means which is claimed to be much less expensive and more effective and can be constructed much faster than by the old methods heretofore in use, such as digging down and putting in caissons before attempting to create a pier.\nI have come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge and the three judges of the Court of Appeal who agreed with him were right in their view that, having regard to the state of the art at the date of the patent, the methods and devices in respect of which protection is claimed involved no patentable improvement. The learned trial judge in a short judgment expressed his findings and conclusions in these words:\u2014\nThere is nothing new or novel about underpinning foundation walls by making a hole by digging or boring and filling it with concrete or other substance. There is nothing novel in using a boring tool with a guiding member to make such a hole. There is nothing new in using an operating line in sections where there is not plenty of headroom. The only thing in this patent which was relied on as being patentable was the use of an \u201coperating line comprising a number of similar detachable sections connected one to the other by universal joints.\u201d It would seem to me that this is one of the very things which the universal joint itself is designed for and intended to do. A guiding member has been used with a boring tool driven by an operating line in sections. As shown in \u201cModern Underpinning\u201d by White and Prentis (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, and Chapman & Hall, Ltd., London) the universal joint has been used with augers to muck out sectional steel pipe piles when being put-in place to underpin old walls. Can this be said to be an invention simply because concrete or cement is put in the hole instead of a driven steel pipe? The method described in this patent is simply doing exactly what has been done before except that the power is not applied or transmitted in a direct line. Now, this is the universal joint itself which was invented long ago.\nI quote this passage in full because, it is very clear, I think, that there is ample evidence to support these findings; and, looking at the matter in a reasonable and practical way, they seem to be virtually conclusive against the appellant.\nWhat was done, apparently, was to apply for the first time successfully in Winnipeg a very convenient procedure for underpinning buildings. The three most important features of this method consisted in the use of the universal joint, in the use of a guiding member to direct a boring tool, and in the use of the walls of an excavation sunk by the boring tool for the purpose of moulding a concrete pillar. As the learned trial judge points out, all the essential features of this system were in common use in New York for the same purpose, subject to this, viz., that, owing to the composition of the soil there, it is necessary, as a rule, first to drive down a casing in order to sustain the walls of the excavation while the concrete is introduced and is settling, and in order to prevent invasion by matter from the surrounding soil which might weaken the concrete structure. But, it was not disputed that the idea of using the walls of the excavation where the soil is suitable for the purpose of moulding the concrete pillar was no new idea. That is admitted and the learned trial judge has found it as a fact.\nThe procedure explained in the text book which was put in evidence, to which the learned trial judge refers, consists first in boring a hole, \u201cmucking out,\u201d as the phrase is, then the sinking of a casing, and after that, the introduction of concrete. Under the patentee's system the casing is dispensed with. That, as I have said, admittedly was not a new idea. To a skilled person having an adequate knowledge of the state of the arts involved, no exercise of inventive faculty would be required in devising the methods or the appliances, or the arrangements thereof, in respect of which protection is claimed, or in the application of them for the purpose defined. In other words, when the state of the art at the date of the patent is properly understood, it is clear, as it appears to me, that these things constituted no improvement proceeding from invention as contemplated by the patent law.\nI express no opinion, however, upon the issue raised on behalf of the respondent as to the proof of infringement in fact. After the conclusion of the argument, a communication was addressed to the Court on behalf of the appellant in which it was suggested that, even if infringement had not been proved, there was sufficient evidence of threats of infringement. The communication was, in effect, a request for a reargument on the point which, in the circumstances, could not have been granted, even if it could properly (which it could not) be considered in the form in which it was presented. Apart from this, the plaintiff's case was not put upon that basis either at the trial, or in the Court of Appeal, or in the appellant's factum. In such circumstances, the Court could not, at this stage, (as matter of substance), permit such a contention to be advanced by an appellant.\nNor do I express any opinion upon another contention put forward by the respondent's counsel to the effect that there is no claim in respect of the patentee's procedure as a whole, but only claims in respect of method and separate claims in respect of devices. Nor do I pronounce upon the contention that, since, admittedly, the patentee's procedure would only be operable in soil of suitable consistency and condition, and since there is nothing in the patent defining, either by reference to soil composition or by reference to locality, the places in which it would be operable, the patent is void for want of sufficient disclosure. I express, as I say, no opinion upon this point, but there does appear to be some force in the suggestion that if the operability of the patentee's procedure in the soil found in Winnipeg were a circumstance, the discovery of which involved invention, then the patent, which makes no reference to Winnipeg or any other locality, or to the matter of soil composition, stops short of a disclosure which would enable a person of ordinary skill to work the invention usefully without the necessity of the exercise of inventive ingenuity.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O'Grady & O'Grady.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. R. Crawford.\n[1] 43 Man. R. 245; [1935] 2 W.W.R. 593; [1935] 4 D.L.R. 160.\n[2] 43 Man. R. 245, at 245-248.\n",

From dismissal by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (9 M.P.R. 437) of an appeal from the order of interim injunction, defendants appealed to this Court. Held: Appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction. It was clear that the ground of the judgment appealed from was that plaintiff, in support of his application for an interim injunction, had produced a prima facie case sufficient to satisfy the court that it was \u201cjust or convenient\u201d to hold matters in statu quo until final determination of the issue. There was no final determination of any substantive right in issue in the action, and, therefore, the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment within the contemplation of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe court pointed out that an interim injunction, like all interlocutory orders, bears in gremio a reservation of leave to apply; and, further, that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has full control over the course of the proceedings; has full power, if convenience or justice so demand, to direct that the issue concerning the holding of a meeting for the specified purpose shall be tried and determined before the issue arising on the claim for repayment is finally disposed of.\nAPPEAL by the defendants (by leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] dismissing (Chisholm C.J. and Ross J. dissenting) their appeal from an order of Doull J.[2] granting an interim injunction to the effect as stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was quashed with costs, on the ground of want of jurisdiction.\nW. G. Ernst K.C. for the appellant.\nE. T. Parker K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014After fully considering the able argument of Mr. Ernst, we are forced to the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nThe judgment appealed from is a judgment dismissing an appeal from an order by Mr. Justice Doull granting an interim injunction restraining the Shelburne Shipbuilders Ltd. from holding a meeting of the company for the purpose of ratifying or confirming certain withdrawals or payments to the late Alfred D. Bruce, the president or manager in his lifetime of the defendant company, alleged to be in excess of his salary.\nThe claims endorsed upon the writ are, first, for repayment and reimbursement by the executrix and executor of the deceased Alfred D. Bruce of certain moneys alleged to have been \u201cwrongfully, improperly and illegally\u201d withdrawn and paid to the said deceased, Alfred D. Bruce, in compliance with an invalid resolution alleged to have been passed at a general meeting of the company; and, second, for an injunction restraining the company from holding or allowing to be held the annual general meeting of the company on the 6th November, 1934, or holding any meeting of the company for the purpose of attempting to ratify or confirm such allegal illegal withdrawals or payments to the said Alfred D. Bruce.\nIt is clear, from the judgment of the majority of the court, that the appeal from Mr. Justice Doull was dismissed on the ground that, in support of their application for an interim injunction, the plaintiffs in the action had produced a prima facie case sufficient to satisfy the court-that it was \u201cjust or convenient\u201d to hold matters in statu quo until the final determination of the issue.\nThere is no final determination of any substantive right in issue in the action, and, therefore, the judgment is not a final judgment within the contemplation of the Supreme Court Act. The argument chiefly emphasized in support of the appeal was that the appellants are, by the restraining order, deprived of the opportunity to avail themselves of their voting rights as shareholders in order to strengthen their defence against the respondents\u2019 claim for the repayment of moneys alleged to have been illegally paid to the deceased, Alfred D. Bruce. This is an argument which goes to the merits of the matter, and not to the question of jurisdiction.\nIt should be observed, however, that an interim injunction, like all interlocutory orders, bears in gremio a reservation of leave to apply; and, further, that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has full control over the course of the proceedings; has full power, if convenience or justice so demand, to direct that the issue concerning the holding of a meeting for the specified purpose shall be tried and determined before the issue arising on the claim for repayment is finally disposed of.\nThe appeal will be quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: V.

That company, on November 30, 1928, transferred the Ontario portion of the business to an Ontario company which S. and M. had organized and of which they were high officials and directors. The Dominion company owned practically all the shares of the Ontario company.\nOn October 16, 1929, plaintiff employed the Ontario company (hereinafter called the company) as his agent and broker to buy 7,000 shares of a certain stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange at market prices on margin, and deposited, at varying intervals, in all, 14,000 shares of the same stock (hereinafter called the collateral) as security to maintain the margin. This Court found, or accepted findings of, the following facts: The company, while it did go upon the Exchange and buy 7,000 shares, virtually nullified that purchase by selling shares on its own account, the effect of this, under the Stock Exchange practice, being that the company took delivery of few, if any, of the shares so bought, and it did not get or carry shares from which it could make delivery to plaintiff if and when required. Though any asserted marginal requirement was always met by plaintiff promptly, the collateral was disposed of, in most instances, immediately it was deposited; in all, 11,800 of said 14,000 shares were disposed of for about $65,320. On January 13, 1930, plaintiff called for delivery of the 7,000 shares. The company bought upon the market (which had fallen) 7,000 shares for about $25,000 and delivered them to plaintiff as and for the shares which he had ordered in October. Plaintiff accepted the shares and paid the amount demanded ($50,334.92 for price, brokerage and interest), believing that the shares were those which he had ordered in October. The company also repurchased upon the market 11,800 shares for about $32,000, and these, along with the 2,200 shares which it had not sold, it delivered to plaintiff as the collateral, retaining the secret profit of about $33,320 which it had made on the sale and repurchase. The company\u2019s conduct, both as to the 7,000 shares and the collateral, was in pursuance of a general system, which had been inaugurated by S. and M. when partners as aforesaid, and which had been carried on continuously since by the successive owners and operators of the business. S. and M. controlled and directed all the business and practices of the company.\nA judgment against the company and S. and M. (for the difference between what the company charged plaintiff for the 7,000 shares and what it acquired them for when delivery was requested, and for the difference between what the company received and paid for the collateral; with adjustment for interest and brokerage) was, as to S. and M. reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action as against S. and M. Plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: (1) As to the 7,000 shares: Under the terms of the accepted order to buy and the representations regarding its execution, there was a legal duty on the company to get delivery of the shares bought and to carry always a sufficient number of shares available for delivery to plaintiff when demanded (Conmee v. Securities Holding Co., 38 Can. S.C.R. 601; Solloway v. Blumberger, [1933] Can. S.C.R. 163, at 167); which duty was not fulfilled. The October order to buy was never fully executed and so came to naught. This relieved plaintiff of any contractual obligation to take any shares at any price. He was not obliged to take or retain the shares bought in January, but he had by his conduct after discovering the facts elected to retain the shares, thereby adopting the company\u2019s action in buying the shares as his agent, and defeating his claim, which he might otherwise have had, for conversion (his retention of the shares being a denial that they had passed to anyone else, and, further, the retention after election amounting in law to waiver of the conversion, not only against the converting company, but against all who participated\u2014the waiver extending to the entire cause of action, absolving all the joint tortfeasors\u2014Buckland v. Johnson, 15 C.B. 145). Plaintiff\u2019s remedy was for a strict accounting as agent. On the pleadings (and rejecting any claim for conversion) plaintiff\u2019s claim must be taken as based on agency, the purchase adopted as that of January, and the claim as being for the overcharge against him for the shares then bought by the company. This claim plaintiff was entitled to recover from the company, and was now merged in his judgment against it. Although that judgment stood unchallenged, it could not be regarded as the measure of the directors\u2019 liability in respect of the frauds (Solloway v. Johnson, [1934] A.C. 193, at 206). Before a director can be held liable for the acts of his company there must be established, (1) fraud of the company, and (2) loss or damage to the customer attributable to that fraud, or benefit accruing to the director from the fraud (Solloway v. Johnson, supra, at 207-8). In the present case, both fraud of the company and loss or damage (consisting in the excess or overcharge paid by plaintiff as aforesaid, the return of which he had been unable to secure) were established. Plaintiff should have judgment against S. and M. (and the company) to the extent of the moneys paid by him to the company for the 7,000 shares in excess of the actual market price as paid by the company for them on January 13, 1930, and the proper brokerage charges based on that price; and interest on that excess from January 13, 1930.\n(2) As to the collateral: Plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages for conversion was defeated by his retention of the shares delivered to him as return of the collateral. As to a claim based on agency: Judgment, obtained against the company, for the profits, could be obtained against the directors only on proof of the two elements aforesaid, fraud and loss, \u201closs\u201d including benefit accruing to the directors attributable to the fraud. By retaining the shares plaintiff had elected to treat them as being the very shares that he deposited as collateral. Securing their return had not cost him anything. The withholding of the profits from him was not in itself a loss to him, because any right he might have to recover them was based, not upon a theory that they belonged to him or that he had lost what the agent had gained, but rather upon the broader doctrine of morality,\u2014that good faith and honest dealing forbid an agent to make secret profits and require him to account for any made. (Parker v. McKenna, L.R. 10 Ch. App. 96, at 118; Hutchinson v. Fleming, 40 Can. S.C.R. 134). Therefore plaintiff could not be said to have suffered \u201closs or damage\u201d in respect of the collateral. His claim for the secret profits (necessarily, for reasons aforesaid, based on assumption of agency, and precluding all ground partaking of the nature of tort) could only be allowed against the directors on proof that they had either received the profits or derived some benefit attributable to the fraud. They could not have made profit directly, because they were not, the company alone being, the plaintiff\u2019s agent. While plaintiff had a right to sue them for profit (as inferentially appears from Solloway v. Johnson, supra, at 207), yet no foundation was laid, either in the pleadings or evidence, upon which a conclusion could be based that they secured profits, or any benefit to themselves attributable to fraud. On this branch, therefore, plaintiff\u2019s appeal failed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1934] O.R. 464, reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which (Macdonnell J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal of Solloway and Mills, the present respondents (defendants), from the judgment of Kerwin J.[2], who (subject to a correction in the amount for which judgment should be entered) dismissed their appeal from the report of the Assistant Master (by whom the action was tried, pursuant to an order that the action be referred to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Toronto for trial, under s. 67 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 88), in favour of the plaintiff (as against Solloway, Mills & Co. Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, and the said Solloway and Mills, for the difference between what the plaintiff was charged by said company for certain 7,000 shares in question and what the said company acquired them for when delivery was requested, and for the difference between what the said company received when it disposed of certain collateral and what it paid for it when required for delivery to plaintiff; with adjustment for interest and brokerage).\nBy the said judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the action was dismissed as against the present respondents, Solloway and Mills.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ.C. McRuer K.C. for the appellant.\nA.G. Slaght K.C. and R.I. Ferguson for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDYSART J. (ad hoc)\u2014This appeal from the Court of Appeal of Ontario has to do with claims made by a customer against directors of a stock brokerage company, arising out of fraudulent dealings by the company, instigated by the directors, in connection with, (1) shares which the company bought, and delivered to the customer in professed execution of the customer\u2019s previous order to buy such shares for him on margin, and (2) shares which the customer deposited with the company to secure that margin. For convenience, the two groups will be considered separately.\nThe action, as commenced by the customer, was against four defendants,\u2014Solloway, Mills & Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Dominion Company), Solloway, Mills & Co. Ltd. (to be called the Ontario Company), Isaac W.C. Solloway and Harvey Mills. Before trial, the Dominion Company, being then in bankruptcy, was eliminated as a defendant because leave to proceed against it had not been obtained as required by the Bankruptcy Act. The trial took place before the Assistant Master of the Court on a reference, and judgment was obtained for a large sum in favour of the plaintiff against the Ontario Company and the two individual defendants. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed by Kerwin J. for the sum of $55,922.98, but was subsequently reversed as to the two individual defendants by the Court of Appeal, Macdonnell J.A. dissenting. From that reversal this appeal is taken by the customer. Dealing with the first group of shares: On October 16, 1929, the Ontario Company agreed to act as the agent and broker of the customer in purchasing for him 7,000 shares of the Sudbury Basin Mines Ltd. on the Toronto Stock Exchange at market prices on margin. In due course, the company, by a series of \u201cbought notes,\u201d notified the customer that it had bought for his \u201caccount and risk\u201d the ordered shares, and had charged his account with the price thereof, namely, $48,937.50, plus brokerage fees. The bought notes also stated that the purchases were\nmade subject in all respects to the rules, by-laws and customs existing at the time at the Exchange * * *\nand\nwith the distinct understanding that the actual delivery is contemplated,\nand that\nall securities * * * may be loaned * * * or * * * pledged * * * for the sum due thereon or for a greater sum * * * without further notice to the customer.\nThe company thereafter rendered periodical accounts showing the customer\u2019s indebtedness for the above sums together with interest thereon, and showing nothing to suggest that the marginal securities were in any degree inadequate to satisfy the marginal requirements. This state of things continued until the transaction was closed in January, 1930.\nUnder the terms of the accepted order for purchase, and the representations regarding its execution, there was a legal duty upon the company to get delivery of the shares so bought for its customer, and to carry them ready for delivery to him whenever that delivery might be demanded (Conmee v. Securities Holding Company[3]); or, at least, bearing in mind that, in contemplation of law, one share of stock is as good as another share of the same denomination, and that physical certificates themselves are merely evidence of the shares, the company was bound to have and to keep on hand at all times a sufficient number of such shares available for that delivery (Solloway et al. v. Blumberger[4]).\nContrary to its contractual duty and to its representations, the company did not fully execute the customer\u2019s order. True, it did go upon the Exchange and buy 7,000 shares of the ordered stock, but at the same time it virtually nullified that purchase by selling shares of the same denomination on its own account. The consequence of this selling was that, in accordance with the Stock Exchange practice, the company\u2019s sales of each day were set off pro tanto against its purchases of the day, and only the excess, if any, of the purchased shares over the sold shares were, at the close of the day\u2019s trading, delivered to the company. In the result, the company took delivery of few, if any, of the shares so bought for the customer. Nor did it have on hand or carry other such shares from which it could make delivery if and when required. Thus the company did not fully execute the customer\u2019s order in that, although it bought, it did not get or carry, the shares so ordered.\nOn January 13, 1930, the customer called for delivery of the 7,000 shares. He was then told that the total amount owing for price, brokerage and interest, was $50,334.92. The company at the same time went upon the market and bought 7,000 shares of the stock for approximately $25,000 and delivered them to the customer as and for the shares which he had ordered on October 16, 1929. The customer accepted the shares, and paid the amount demanded, believing that the shares were those which he had ordered on October 16, 1929, and that he was contractually bound to accept and pay for them.\nAll that the company did in connection with these shares in breach of its duty, was done in pursuance of a general scheme or system whereby the company sold shares when its customers bought, using the customers\u2019 shares to make delivery of its own sales. This system was so extensively practised that the company was at times \u201cshort\u201d 100,000 shares of this particular stock. The system had been inaugurated by these two individual defendants some years before when as partners under the name of Solloway, Mills & Co. they conducted the brokerage business which in substance was continued through successive transfers down to the date of the transactions now under review. The first of these transfers took place on May 31, 1928, when the partners turned their Dominion-wide business over to the Dominion Company, which they had organized to take over the business; and the second was on November 30, 1928, when the Dominion Company transferred the Ontario portion of the business to the Ontario Company which the original partners had likewise organized to accept this transfer. There is some question as to the completeness of these transfers, but there is no doubt that the \u201csystem\u201d was carried on without change or interruption by the successive owners and operators of the business.\nThe active participation of the individual defendants in the fraudulent scheme or system as conducted by the Ontario Company was made possible and probable by the facts that, as officers and almost the sole shareholders of the Dominion Company, which in turn owned practically all the shares of the Ontario Company, they stood to benefit substantially from all profits or gains made by the Ontario Company; and that, as high officials and directors of the Ontario Company, they controlled and directed all the business and practices of that company, including this system of making profit. Positive evidence was given at the trial that the directors did take an active part in directing the operations of the system, and, although available at the trial, they did not give testimony in denial\u2014a reticence on their part from which strong inferences may properly be drawn. The Assistant Master has expressly found as a fact that the fraud was the concerted action of the Ontario Company and the two directors\u2014a finding that is amply supported by the evidence, and has not been questioned in any of the appeal judgments.\nBefore examining the claims put forward in this action, it will be helpful to consider briefly what remedies were open to the customer, and how far they were affected or circumscribed by his own conduct. In the first place, it is clear that on discovering the fraud, the customer had the choice either of retaining the shares or of rejecting them. If he retained them he would thereby ratify or adopt the action of the company; in other words, would acknowledge that in so buying the shares the company acted as agent for him under some authority which, if not previously given, would then be conferred so as to relate back to the time of the purchase; and the only remedy open to him would be to hold the company to a strict accounting as his agent. The customer here did elect to retain the shares\u2014he had previously taken delivery of them, and he never afterwards returned them, nor offered to return them. A further consequence of his retention of the shares would be to deprive him of the right which he otherwise would have had to sue for the conversion of the shares, because conversion presupposes that title to the shares had passed from him to someone else, whereas his retention of them was a denial of that supposition. Further, retention after election amounts in law to a waiver of the conversion, not only against the converting company, but against all who participated in the conversion, including the two directors; because the waiver extends to the entire cause of action, absolving all the joint tort-feasors; Buckland v. Johnson[5].\nThe purchase which was adopted must have been either that of October 16, 1929, or that of January 13, 1930. It could not possibly be both, because there could not in this transaction be more than one purchase of these shares by the company for the customer. The adoption of one purchase necessarily means that the other was not adopted, and so was left on the company\u2019s hands as its own, and disappears from the case. If the October purchase were adopted, it would have to be on the assumption that, contrary to the facts, but consistent with the company\u2019s representations, the company acquired the shares in October, and thereafter carried them until it delivered them on January 13; if, on the other hand, the purchase of January were adopted, it would assume that the shares had not been purchased for the customer prior to January. In either case, the customer\u2019s remedy would be based not on conversion but on agency, and would seek to recover from the agent all secret profits made during the agency.\nWe shall now see how the customer framed his action. In his statement of claim he alleges, inter alia, that on October 16, 1929, he employed the company as his agent and broker to buy for him 7,000 shares; that the company repeatedly represented that it had executed the order; that in fact the company never fully executed the order; that on January 13, 1930, the company, without knowledge or acquiescence of customer, bought 7,000 shares and delivered them to him; that the company then by false representations induced him to pay for these shares a sum far greater than the actual price it had paid for them; and that the company so acted in pursuance of a system of fraud in which the directors actively participated. In his prayer for relief he asks for,\u2014\n(b) The recovery of $28,637.50 paid by the plaintiff to the defendant company upon the representation that the defendant company had paid for the account of the plaintiff the sum of $48,937.50 for 7,000 shares of Sudbury Basin Mines Limited purchased for the account of the plaintiff, when in fact it paid $20,300.\nThis pleading also contains averments that the company \u201cconverted and sold\u201d the shares in October, and asks for general damages.\nIt is to be observed that the customer here seeks to pursue two divergent courses, one based on agency, the other on tort. The conversion claimed is stated only in a secondary way, and at any rate is defeated by the retention of the shares; and if the agency claim, which is stated more explicitly, is to stand, the conversion claim must be rejected, because no one may on the same set of facts sue in tort and agency at the same time, such causes of action being so different, if not opposite in their natures, as to be incompatible with each other: Smith v. Baker[6]; Rice v. Reed[7].\nThe action must therefore be considered as having been laid in agency. It is also clear that the purchase which has been adopted is that of January, and the claim is for the overcharge made on that day. As thus regarded, the claim is entirely consistent with the retention of the shares, as well as with the adoption of the agency, and entitles the customer on proof submitted in support thereof to recover from the company all moneys which on January 13 he paid in excess of the actual price, plus proper brokerage fees. That claim is now merged in the judgment which stands against the company, and which to that extent is hereby affirmed.\nAlthough the judgment against the company stands unchallenged, it cannot be regarded as the measure of the directors\u2019 liability in respect of the frauds, because, as stated by Lord Blanesburgh in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Solloway v. Johnson[8], a case in which similar questions were under consideration, and in which the appellant was a director,\nSo far their Lordships have been dealing with the case as it affects indifferently both the defendant company and the appellant. But the actual liability of the appellant is a thing distinct and apart from that of the company, and the judgment, even if well founded as against the company, may be incapable of support as against him.\nBefore a director can be held liable for the acts of his company two facts must be established: (1) fraud of the company, and (2) loss or damage to the customer attributable to that fraud, or benefit accruing to the director from the fraud (Solloway v. Johnson, supra, at pp. 207-8).\nIn the case under review the fraud of the company is clearly established. The loss would seem to be no less clear. The customer was induced by misrepresentations of his agent to part with a large sum of money (over and above the actual amount which he should have paid), and has not since been able to secure the return of that excess. Surely that sum represents loss or damage to him. In the Court of Appeal it was said that the customer suffered no damage because \u201che got the shares that he purchased at the price at which he agreed to purchase them.\u201d With this view I cannot agree. The shares which the customer got and retained had not been purchased by him, nor at any agreed price. The order of October to buy at October prices was never fully executed and so came to naught, and relieved the customer of any contractual obligation to take any shares at any price; and no order for purchase was subsequently given by him. The January purchase by the company was at January prices; but here again there was no order, and so no obligation on the customer to take or retain the shares at even January prices,\u2014certainly not at October prices. By electing to retain these shares after discovering the facts, the customer bound himself to recoup his agent for the actual price it had paid for the shares, and to compensate it for its brokerage services. That is the position he now takes. The excess or overcharge, as collected by the agent, resulted in something to the cus- tomer that cannot be designated as anything less than direct loss or damage.\nThe customer is therefore entitled to recover from the director in respect of this first group of shares.\nTurning now to the second group, namely, the 14,000 shares of Sudbury Basin Mines Limited deposited as security to maintain the margin: The plaintiff deposited 3,500 of these shares with the company on October 16, 1929, when placing his order to buy, and thereafter, keeping pace with the company\u2019s calls for additional margin in a falling market, he deposited at varying intervals other shares of the same stock in smaller lots, until by December 16th he had put up a total of 14,000 shares. This collateral, in the language of the Assistant Master, \u201cwas disposed of, in most instances, immediately it was deposited.\u201d In all 11,800 of the shares were so disposed of for sums approximating $65,320. Then on January 13, 1930, in order to satisfy the customer\u2019s demand for the return of his securities when closing out his account, the company went upon the market and repurchased 11,800 of the shares for about $32,000, and these, along with the 2,200 shares which it had not sold, it delivered to him as and for the shares which it had received from him on deposit. The company retained the secret illegal profit of about $33,320 which it had made on the sale and repurchase of this collateral.\nThere never was at any time the slightest possible right in the company to sell the collateral shares, because (1) there was no margin to sustain where the October order to buy had not been fully executed; and (2) even apart from that, the falsely asserted marginal requirements had always been met by the customer promptly and fully and to the satisfaction of the company.\nThe sale and repurchase of these shares had been carried out in pursuance of another branch of the same general scheme or system which has already been described, and were, in the finding of the Assistant Master, fraudulently perpetrated by the concerted action of the company and the directors.\nThe discussion in regard to the first group of shares will serve to shorten the consideration of this group. On dis- covering the fraud the customer had the right to (1) reject and return the 11,800 shares, and sue the company and its directors as tort feasors for converting his shares, claiming the proceeds of the conversion sale or the value of the shares; or (2) to retain the shares and sue the company as his agent for the profits secretly made by it in the course of the agency and to include as parties to the action the directors who benefited from the fraud.\nIn his statement of claim on this branch of the case, the customer alleges only that the company \u201cwrongfully converted and sold\u201d the shares in pursuance of a conspiracy existing between itself and its directors, and claims generally for damages. The pleading also lays some indirect foundation for the specific prayer in which he asks for secret profits in these terms:\u2014\n28. (a) The sum of $33,320, being the profit made by the defendants on the sale of 11,800 shares of Sudbury Basin Mines Limited stock delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant company, and sold by it and repurchased for delivery to the plaintiff at a lesser price.\nThe claim for damages for conversion is defeated by the retention of the shares, and must be rejected. The specific claim for \u201cprofit\u201d remains alone for consideration; and although direct allegations in support of the claim are wanting in the pleading, there are, it would seem, sufficient indirect allegations which, when coupled with the retention of the shares and the general evidence offered, may serve to form a basis for dealing with this group of shares upon an agency footing.\nThe judgment obtained against the company for the profits, although not challenged by the bankrupt company, can be upheld as against the directors only upon proof of the two elements already discussed, namely, fraud and loss. Loss, as we have seen, includes benefit accruing to the directors attributable to the fraud. By retaining the shares the customer has elected to treat them as being the very shares that he deposited as collateral. But, in order to secure their return, he did not, as he did in the case of the 7,000 shares, pay any money, nor part with anything else, nor enter into any obligation to give or do anything. Assuming that he is entitled to the profits, the withholding of the profits from him is not in itself a loss to him, because any right that he may have to recover those profits is based upon the theory, not that they belong to him, nor that he has lost what the agent has gained, but rather is based upon the broader doctrine of morality,\u2014that good faith and honest dealing forbid an agent to make secret profits out of the agency, or, if he has made profits, demand that he account for them to his principal: Parker v. McKenna[9]; Hutchinson v. Fleming[10]. On no ground, therefore, is it conceivable that the customer can be said to have suffered \u201closs or damage\u201d in respect of these shares.\nHe is, however, entitled to the secret profits, but only by proving that the directors have either received the profits, or have derived some benefit attributable to the fraud. This claim for profits, it may be repeated, is based on the assumption of agency, and precludes all ground partaking of the nature of tort. In his prayer, the customer asks for \u201cthe profit made by the defendants\u201d; and this may be taken as an indirect allegation that the directors derived benefit through the company, and not that they made profit directly. They could not have made profit directly, because they were not the agent of the customer\u2014their company alone was the agent, as the customer alleges. If they directly participated in making the illegal profit, they might have been guilty of tort, but that has been waived. The right to sue them for such profit is very well established. In Solloway v. Johnson, supra[11], a case in which the customer claimed profit against a director, the claim was refused, because, in the language of Lord Blanesburgh, at p. 207,\nas has already been pointed out, no loss or damage attributable to the fraud is here proved: no benefit from any proved fraud is shown to have accrued to the appellant.\nInferentially, if proof had been furnished in that case, the claim would have been allowed. In the case before us no foundation is laid, either in the pleadings or in the evidence, upon which a conclusion could be based that the directors secured any benefit to themselves attributable to fraud; least of all that they have secured profits. If a contrary conclusion were drawn, it would be solely upon the assumption that the profits made by the Ontario Company found their way through the Dominion Company to the directors, but that is not shown; in the absence of the Dominion Company as a party to this action, it would not be feasible or possible to establish that as a fact.\nOn this branch of the case, therefore, the appeal must fail.\nThe general result, therefore, is:\u2014\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Kerwin restored with respect to the group of 7,000 shares, but only to the extent of the moneys paid by the customer to the Ontario Company in excess of the actual market price as paid by that company for the shares on January 13, 1930, and the proper brokerage charges based on that price. Interest on this excess is allowed to the customer from January 13, 1930.\nIn respect of the group of 14,000 shares, the appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to costs: The appellant should have the costs of the action against the respondents, Isaac W.C. Solloway and Harvey Mills, except the costs exclusively attributable to the issue on which the appellant fails. The appellant should pay to the respondents the costs of the appeal to Mr. Justice Kerwin and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal. The appellant should have his costs of the appeal to this Court.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McRuer, Mason, Cameron & Brewin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Slaght & Cowan.\n[1] [1934] O.R. 464; [1934] 4 D.L.R. 36.\n[2] [1934] O.R. 464, at 466-469.\n[3] (1907) 38 Can.

C.J.[3]) that, upon the facts established in this case, the respondent company had only one business, that of Theatre Controller and Operator (and, to give its proper description as such, the assessment roll should be amended), in respect of which business it was liable to business assessment, and that all its investments and all income derived therefrom (in 1932, the year in question) were made and received in connection with that business, and could not, therefore, be assessed for income (except in the sum of $3,586.40, admittedly received from investment of surplus funds in public securities).\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing the argument of counsel for the appellant, the members of the Court retired for consultation and, after their return to the Bench, the Court, without calling on counsel for the respondent, delivered judgment orally, dismissing the appeal with costs. The Chief Justice stated that the Court had considered fully the useful arguments of Mr. Colquhoun and Mr. Kent, and had reached the conclusion that it would be impossible to set aside the findings of the Board on the ground that, on the evidence, they were legally inadmissible; and considered it equally impossible to hold that, given the findings, the order of the Board was wrong in law.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nC.M.

Cronin, [1936] S.C.R. 142\nDate: 1936-03-13\nJohn H. Rodd (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nArthur D. Cronin and Irene E. Cronin (Defendants) Respondents.\n1936: March 12, 13.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Sale of land\u2014Objection to title\u2014Purchaser terminating contract\u2014Vendor claiming specific performance\u2014Extent of title agreed to be conveyed\u2014Vendor claiming rectification of formal contract\u2014Alternative claim for specific performance of formal contract, with reference as to title.\nPlaintiff sued for specific performance of an agreement of sale of land and land covered with water from him to defendant. Shortly after the agreement, the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada had asserted a claim to a part of the land as having passed to it at Confederation, under s. 108 of the B.N.A. Act, as part of a public harbour, and, on plaintiff\u2019s refusal to remove this objection to title, defendant had purported to terminate the agreement. The trial judge found (sustaining plaintiff\u2019s claim) that, under the agreement, plaintiff was selling only such title as he had in the lands, and granted specific performance. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which found that plaintiff had agreed to convey a good and sufficient title to the lands, and dismissed his action. Plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Appeal dismissed. A certain executed formal document, under which plaintiff was bound to convey a good and sufficient title to the lands, constituted the only binding agreement, and plaintiff had established no adequate case for reformation in the sense claimed. The trial judge apparently failed to appreciate the evidentiary weight which must be ascribed to the fact of execution of that document and the legal consequences of that fact. As to defendant\u2019s objection to title because of said claim of the Crown\u2014the evidence tended to show that part at least of the westerly portion of the lands was used as a public harbour before Confederation, and warranted the court in refusing to force such a doubtful title on defendant.\nThe court refused to plaintiff a decree of specific performance of the agreement as it stood, with a reference as to title, because, (1) when plaintiff took the stand that defendant was bound to accept such title as he had, he was virtually repudiating his obligations under the formal agreement, and defendant, in view of the situation created by the Crown\u2019s claim, had just and solid grounds for his action in terminating the agreement, which thereupon ceased to have any virtue as a foundation for any claim by plaintiff; (2) no such claim or offer to accept such a decree (alternatively to rectification of the formal agreement) had been made by plaintiff until argument at trial after completion of the evidence, and, in view of plaintiff\u2019s persistent attitude up to that time, such claim should not be allowed in the appellate courts.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, reversing the judgment of Jeffrey J., dismissed the action, which was brought, by plaintiff as vendor, for specific performance of an agreement for sale of lands. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nR.S. Rodd K.C. for the appellant.\nE.C. Awrey K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, we considered that no grounds had been shown upon which this Court could interfere with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and it was therefore unnecessary to call upon counsel for the respondents.\nIn his statement of claim, the appellant asked specific performance of what he alleged was the agreement between himself and the respondent, Arthur D. Cronin, but made no reference to a formal written document executed by the parties on June 27th, 1933. The said respondent, in his statement of defence, alleged that the contract between himself and the appellant was embodied in this formal document, in which the lands that were the subject of the sale were described by metes and bounds, to which the appellant agreed to give a good and sufficient title; that, the title to a large part of the lands described being still in the Crown, it was understood that the respondent should proceed with the necessary application to the Public Works Department under the Navigable Waters\u2019 Protection Act for approval of the construction of a dock for the purpose of which the respondent was acquiring the pro- perty; that, the application of the respondent to the Public Works Department having been brought to the attention of the Department of Marine, that Department asserted a claim to the site of the proposed structure as part of a public harbour which had passed to the Dominion at Confederation by force of section 108 of the British North America Act; that the respondent, having ascertained that the appellant had neither a title in himself nor power to require conveyance of the title, and the appellant having \u201cnotified the respondent that he would not clear up the title,\u201d rescinded the contract.\nBy paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim, the appellant averred:\u2014\nAlthough the said defendant was to take the title as patented he subsequently desired a definite patent carrying the lands to the harbour line, and after some negotiation the plaintiff undertook to obtain the patent from the Department of Lands and Forests of the Province of Ontario, each of the parties, however, to pay half of the fee to be charged by the Department for such patent.\nand by paragraph 3 of the reply:\n* * * the fact is that this defendant was to accept the title to the lands as patented by the Crown, but subsequently at his request, and to hasten the closing of the sale, the plaintiff did undertake to and did obtain a confirmatory and extended grant from the Crown in the right of the Province of Ontario, but at the joint expense of both as the agreement shows. No other or different agreement or understanding in respect thereto was ever made or come to.\nBy his amended reply the appellant set up a claim for reformation of \u201cthe agreement sued upon herein\u201d to bring it into conformity with the agreement so alleged in paragraph 3 of his various pleadings.\nAt the trial, the appellant maintained the position he had assumed in his pleadings, namely, that the respondent had agreed to purchase from the appellant such title as he had under the patents in existence on May 11th. His counsel is thus reported at page 208 of the case:\u2014\nMr. RODD: We say with regard to that in the first place there was no agreement at all to give more than the lands which were covered by the patent, and if you should find that is the case then no matter of defence\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: YOU mean the position you take, under a proper interpretation of the agreement you agree to convey to him only such interest as you have in the land.\nMr. RODD: That is it. All the correspondence fully bears that out.\nHis LORDSHIP: Only such interest as you in fact had, or you purport to have.\nMr. RODD: NO matter how serious it might become that is the first step. On this issue the appellant obtained from the learned trial judge a finding in his favour. \u201cI am of opinion,\u201d the learned judge said, \u201cas before expressed, that the defendant purchased from the plaintiff such title as he, the plaintiff, had in the property.\u201d It was of this agreement that specific performance was granted at the trial.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge. They took the view that the document executed by the parties on June 27th (under which the appellant was bound to convey a good and sufficient title to the lands described) constituted the only binding agreement, and that the appellant had established no adequate case for reformation in the sense in which it was claimed by him. With this we agree. The learned judge failed, it would appear, to appreciate the evidentiary weight which must be ascribed to the fact of the execution of the document of June 27th and the legal consequences of that fact.\nUnder that agreement, the appellant was bound to establish a title in himself in fee simple to all the lands described therein. He contends that he has done so, but, in connection with the various objections raised against such contention by the respondents, it is necessary to refer only to the claim made by the Department of Marine on behalf of His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada to that part of the lands described in the agreement that had not been patented before Confederation. This claim arises under section 108 of the British North America Act: \u201cThe Public Works and Property of each Province enumerated in the Third Schedule to this Act, shall be the Property of Canada.\u201d Item two of the third schedule is \u201cPublic Harbours.\u201d The evidence tends to show that part at least of the westerly portion of the lands in question was used as a public harbour before July 1st, 1867, and warrants the court in refusing to force such a doubtful title on the purchaser.\nIt was also stated that, even if the formal agreement be not rectified, the appellant was willing to accept a decree for specific performance of it as it stands, with a reference as to title. We were informed by his counsel that this position was taken on behalf of the appellant for the first time in argument before the trial judge after the comple- tion of the evidence. He repeated this offer in the Court of Appeal.\nThere are two distinct grounds on which this indulgence must be refused. First, the respondent was justified in putting an end to the agreement. The appellant, in taking the stand that the respondent was bound to accept such title as he had, was virtually repudiating his obligations under the agreement of the 27th of June. And the respondent was in no sense taking advantage of a mere technical situation. The claim of the Dominion Government, so long as it was pressed, constituted a real cloud upon the title. When the appellant repudiated any obligation to convey any title other than that which he possessed, the respondent, in view of the situation created by the Government\u2019s claim, had just and solid grounds for his action in terminating the agreement, which thereupon ceased to have any virtue as a foundation for any claim by the appellant.\nMoreover, we agree with the Court of Appeal, that in view of the appellant\u2019s persistent assertion of his right to force upon the respondent his own title, whatever its defects might be, down to the trial, and at the trial with success, he could not with justice be allowed in the Court of Appeal to claim relief by way of the specific enforcement of the agreement which he had all along repudiated. The claim has no place in the pleadings; no hint of it was given during the course of the trial until, as already observed, after all the evidence\u2014which had not been directed to issues that might have been raised by such a claim\u2014had been presented. Further comment is superfluous; the appellant cannot be allowed to play fast and loose.\nA minor point raised by the appellant is that he should be recompensed for the repairs made by him to the summer cottage which was to be given him in exchange, and which his son\u2011in\u2011law occupied for one season. In taking possession of and making repairs to the cottage, before consummation of the agreement, the appellant took the risk of the matter not being completed. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the respondent Cronin had counter\u2011claimed for an occupation rent of these premises. This counter-claim was dismissed without costs by the trial judge and no appeal was taken by Cronin. While there is no evidence as to the rental value of the property, one claim might very-well be taken to offset the other.\nIn view of the result we need not consider the position of the respondent, Irene E. Cronin, the wife of the respondent, Arthur D. Cronin.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rodd, Wigle, Whiteside & Jasperson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Furlong, Furlong, Awrey & St. Aubin.\n",

At the trial, before Adamson J. with a jury, the jury found the defendant guilty of negligence\nto the extent that the bus was not drawn into the curb to allow the plaintiff to alight. Taking into consideration where the bus did stop and where the plaintiff did alight, the road was in a dangerous and slippery condition. They found damages in the sum of $2,500. They found the plaintiff not guilty of contributory negligence. The trial judge[3] held that there was no evidence \u201cthat the motorman acted unreasonably or otherwise than as a prudent man would have acted,\u201d that \u201cthere was no known or obvious danger at this landing place,\u201d that \u201cthere was nothing to indicate that there was more danger here than at any other place where he might have stopped,\u201d that the case fell fairly within Brunstermann v. Winnipeg Electric Ry. Co.[4], that s. 66 of The King\u2019s Bench Act, Statutes of Manitoba, 1931, c. 6, does not preclude the trial judge from entering a proper verdict, and one in accordance with the law, and one that will be the final judgment, that upon the jury\u2019s finding of fact there was no legal liability; and he accordingly dismissed the action with costs. The Court of Appeal[5] (Dennistoun and True-man JJ.A. dissenting) allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal with costs and ordered that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff for $2,500 and costs.\nOn the defendant\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing argument of counsel for the appellant, the members of the Court retired for consultation, and on their returning to the Bench, the Court, without calling on counsel for the respondent, delivered judgment orally, dismissing the appeal with costs. The Chief Justice stated that Mr. Schroeder had argued the appeal with his accustomed earnestness and thoroughness; that the members of the Court had considered the matter and were quite satisfied that the majority of the Court of Appeal were right; that there was evidence to go to the jury, that the verdict of the jury was sufficient and that there was no ground upon which it could properly be set aside.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nW.

His application therefor, attached to the policy, was for a \u201cnon-cancelable income policy,\u201d and designated his wife as beneficiary. By provisions of the policy, it expired one year from date except as it might be continued by renewal for terms of one year each (or by a certain period of grace), and until the insured became 60 years of age he should have the right to renew the policy from year to year by payment of premium. The policy was kept alive by payment of annual premiums. In 1934, G. was declared, under R.S.O. 1927, c. 98, to be incapable of managing his affairs, and a committee of his estate was appointed. The main question in dispute was whether the monthly payments made by the insurance company under the policy during G.\u2019s disability belonged to the committee or to G.\u2019s wife. Sec. 178 of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 183, in force when the policy was issued, provided that where the contract of insurance or declaration provided that the insurance money should be for the benefit of a \u201cpreferred beneficiary\u201d (that term including a wife), such contract or declaration should (subject as therein provided) create a trust in favour of such beneficiary and that \u201cso long as any object of the trust remains the money payable under the contract shall not be subject to the control of the assured, or of his creditors, or form part of his estate.\u201d The committee contended that any trust thereby created in respect of the policy in question had been destroyed by subsequent statutory enactments.\nHeld: G.\u2019s wife was entitled to the proceeds of the policy. By said designation of her as beneficiary and the operation of said s. 178, a trust was created in her favour; and it was impossible, on the general language of the subsequent amendments, to conclude that the legislature thereby destroyed or intended to destroy said trust or the operation and effect of the above quoted provision in said s. 178. (The subsequent enactments dealt with in the judgment included, inter alia, 1924, c. 50, ss. 114, 134, 135, 136, 139, 177 (3), 180; 1928, c. 35, ss. 4, 6 (2), and new statutory condition 19 substituted for that introduced in 1922 (c. 61); 1931, c. 49, s. 11 (2)). The policy in question was not an annual renewal policy, but a continuous policy, and the distinction (discussed) becomes of importance in considering changes in a general statute governing policies of insurance. Where, as in this case, the contract is of continuous insurance, kept alive, merely by payment of the stipulated annual premium, it requires very clear and precise language in general amendments to destroy a statutory trust created in favour of a named beneficiary at the time the policy was taken out. The subsequent amendments in question may have been intended to have, to a certain extent, retrospective effect, but when the language is not plain the new law ought to be construed so as to interfere as little as possible with vested rights and should not be given a larger retrospective power than one can plainly see the legislature intended (Reid v. Reid, 31 Ch. D. 402, at 408-409).\nHeld, further: The wife was entitled, as between her and the committee, to recover the insurance moneys direct from the insurance company without the intervention of the committee. (National Life Assur. Co. of Canada v. McCoubrey, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 277).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1935] 2 D.L.R. 329, affirmed in the result, with a variation declaring the wife\u2019s rights lastly above mentioned.\nAPPEAL by the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, Committee of the estate of Henry F. Gooderham (who was, by an order in the Supreme Court of Ontario, declared to be a person incapable of managing his affairs), from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal by Mildred Gooderham, wife of the said Henry F. Gooderham, from the order of Kerwin J. declaring that the said committee was entitled to the moneys theretofore paid and thereafter payable under a certain policy insuring the said Henry F. Gooderham against total disability from sickness. The judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside the order of Kerwin J. and declared that the said committee held the insurance moneys paid and would hold those thereafter payable under the policy in trust for the said Mildred Gooderham, the present respondent. The latter cross-appealed for variation of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, to provide that the moneys theretofore paid and thereafter to be paid under the policy should be declared to be payable and should be directed to be paid to her (i.e., that she was entitled to recover direct from the insurance company without the intervention of the committee). The material facts of the case, the material provisions of the policy, and the relevant statutory enactments, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed, with costs throughout.\nJ.C. McRuer K.C. and F.A. Brewin for the appellant.\nJ. Jennings K.C. and G. Lovatt for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014On June 24, 1920, Henry F. Gooderham, a barrister residing in the city of Toronto, then 44 years of age, applied to the Continental Casualty Company, incorporated by the State of Indiana, one of the United States of America, for a policy of insurance against total disability, and in pursuance thereof the company duly issued its policy on August 21, 1920, to Mr. Gooderham insuring him\nagainst disability resulting either from accidental bodily injury or from sickness, if such disability from either cause originates while this policy is in force and results in continuous total loss of business time.\nThe indemnity payable for loss of business time as so defined was $500 per month and the annual premium was $100. The written application for the insurance designated Mildred Gooderham, wife of the insured, as beneficiary under the policy applied for. The policy was kept alive by payment of the annual premiums when, on January 8, 1934, a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of chapter 98 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1927, declared Mr. Gooderham to be a person incapable of managing his affairs, appointed the Toronto General Trusts Corporation to be Committee of his estate and ordered that it be referred to the Master of the said Court to propound and report a scheme for the management of the estate and for the maintenance of Mr. Gooderham.\nThe Continental Casualty Company did not dispute liability upon the policy and monthly payments of $500 as from the 26th of December, 1933 (being the day fixed by an order of a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, dated March 22, 1934, for the commencement of the monthly payments), have been paid regularly by the company to the Committee. The question raised in these proceedings is whether or not these moneys belong to the Toronto General Trusts Corporation (appellant) as such Committee or to Mildred Gooderham (respondent), the wife of the insured, as the designated beneficiary. The company is not a party to the proceedings. The Trust Company moved before a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, on notice to the wife and to the Public Trustee, for an order declaring it, as Committee of Mr. Gooderham\u2019s estate, entitled to the moneys payable under the policy in question. The learned Judge who heard the motion, declared in favour of the Committee; the wife appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario who reversed the order and declared in favour of the wife; and from that order the Committee appealed to this Court. It is only fair to the wife to say that her claim is not in fact an effort to deprive her husband of the fruits of the policy during the unfortunate period of his total disability but is an obvious effort to avoid these moneys becoming available to her husband\u2019s creditors who appear to have reached out for the moneys.\nThe appeal raises an interesting and important question as to the effect of the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act in respect of this policy of accident or sickness insurance. Before considering the relevant provisions of the Insurance Act it is advisable that some observations be made upon the exact wording of the particular policy. The application made by Mr. Gooderham to the company, which was attached to the policy, was for a \u201cnon-cancellable income policy\u201d to provide \u201c$500 per month for disability.\u201d To one of several printed questions set out on the form of application,\n9. Whom do you designate as beneficiary under policy applied for, and what relationship is such beneficiary to you?\nMr. Gooderham filled in the answer opposite the printed word \u201cname:\u201d \u201cMildred,\u201d and opposite the printed word \u201cRelationship:\u201d \u201cWife.\u201d The application contained an agreement by Mr. Gooderham to pay an annual premium of $100. The policy issued pursuant to this application states that\nAfter one year from its date this policy shall be incontestable as to the time of origin of any disability commencing thereafter.\nand\nThe indemnity payable for loss of business time as before defined and as hereinafter made payable is Five Hundred Dollars per month to be paid in monthly instalments during the Company\u2019s liability on any claim.\nThe policy further states that\nIts annual premium is One Hundred Dollars, to be paid in advance.\nand provides that\nThe Company will pay said indemnity for loss of business time during the continuance of disability as defined above, until such time as the Insured engages in a gainful occupation; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be paid for the first month of any period of disability.\nThen follow in the policy what are termed \u201cStatutory Provisions.\u201d There were no such statutory provisions, at the date of the issue of the policy, in the Ontario Insurance Act and these provisions in the policy were substantially taken from the then Dominion Insurance Act. They have, of course, the force of contract between the parties. It is necessary to refer specifically to a few of these provisions or parts of them.\n1. This policy, including the endorsements and attached papers, if any, contains the entire contract of insurance except as it may be modified by the Company\u2019s classification of risks and premium rates as provided in paragraph 6 of these statutory provisions.\n2. All statements made by the Insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties. No such statement shall be used in defense to a claim under this policy unless it is contained in the copy of the application for this policy which is endorsed hereon or attached hereto.\n5. Upon request of the Insured and subject to due proof of loss all accrued indemnity for loss of time on account of disability will be paid at the expiration of each thirty days during the continuance of the period for which the Company is liable, and any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of such period will be paid immediately upon receipt of due proof.\n7. Written notice of injury or sickness on which claim may be based must be given to the Company within thirty days after the date of the accident causing such injury or within fifteen days after the commencement of disability from such sickness.\n8. Such notice given by or in behalf of the Insured or beneficiary, as the case may be, to the Company at its Head Office, in Toronto, Canada, or to any authorized agent of the Company, with particulars sufficient to identify the Insured, shall be deemed to be notice to the Company. Failure to give notice within the time provided in this policy shall not invalidate any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.\n9. The Company upon receipt of such notice, will furnish to the Claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss. * * *\nFollowing the statutory provisions in the policy are certain provisions termed \u201cMiscellaneous Provisions,\u201d to several of which reference should be made. 1. This policy is issued in consideration of the statements and agreements contained in the application therefor and the payment of an annual premium as therein provided. The falsity of any statement in the application, materially affecting either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed hereunder, shall bar all right to recovery under this policy.\n2. This policy becomes effective upon its issue and delivery, if said annual premium has then been paid in full, but otherwise it does not become effective until said premium has been so paid. It expires at 12 o\u2019clock noon (Standard time at residence of Insured) one year from date except as it may be continued by renewal for terms of one year each or by the period of grace hereinafter given.\n4. Until the Insured becomes sixty years of age, he shall have the right to renew this policy from year to year by the payment of premium as herein provided. * * *\n6. The Company shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the Insured when and so often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of claim hereunder.\n8. All indemnities of the policy are payable to the insured at the Head Office of the Company in Canada. Upon the payment of claim hereunder any premium then due or unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.\n11. Strict compliance on the part of the Insured with all the provisions of this policy is a condition precedent to recovery hereunder and any failure in this respect shall forfeit to the Company all right to any indemnity.\nIt is plain that neither the application nor the policy-covered indemnity for accidental loss of life, but only indemnity against disability.\nBefore departing from the exact language of the policy and the application therefor, it is to be noted that the policy itself does not specifically say to whom the proceeds of the policy are to be paid. The policy merely states that it \u201chereby insures\u201d Mr. Gooderham \u201chereinafter called the Insured\u201d against disability. But the application for the policy specifically designated the wife as the beneficiary and nos. 7 and 8 of the Statutory Provisions provide that written notice of injury or sickness on which claim may be based may be given \u201cby or in behalf of the Insured or beneficiary, as the case may be, to the Company.\u201d No. 2 of the Statutory Provisions expressly states that \u201cthe application for this policy\u201d is \u201cendorsed hereon or attached hereto.\u201d And by no. 1 of the Statutory Provisions, \u201cThis policy, including the endorsements and attached papers, if any, contains the entire contract of insurance.\u201d Then as to the right of renewal, no. 2 of the Miscellaneous Provisions provides that the policy expires one year from its date \u201cexcept as it may be continued by renewal for terms of one year each or by the period of grace hereinafter given.\u201d And by no. 4 of the Miscellaneous Provisions, \u201cUntil the Insured becomes sixty years of age, he shall have the right to renew this policy from year to year by the payment of premium as herein provided.\u201d Further, the application was for a \u201cnon-cancelable income policy\u201d on the basis of an annual premium of $100.\nAt the date of the issue of the policy, the Ontario Insurance Act then in force was that contained in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, Ch. 183, and amendments thereto. By sec. 2 (6) \u201cbeneficiary\u201d included every person entitled to insurance money; by sec. 2 (19) \u201cdeclaration\u201d included any mode of designating in writing a, beneficiary; and by sec. 2 (35) \u201cinsurance of the person\u201d included insurance against death, sickness, infirmity, casualty, accident, disability, or against any change of physical or mental condition. Sec. 171 (3) provided that,\nThe assured may designate the beneficiary by the contract of insurance or by an instrument in writing attached to or endorsed on it or by an instrument in writing, including a will, otherwise in any way identifying the contract, * * *\nSec. 178 defined the rights of preferred beneficiaries, and, the first two subsections being vital to the question in issue in this appeal, I shall set them out in full:\n(1) Preferred beneficiaries shall constitute a class and shall include the husband, wife, children, grand-children and mother of the assured, and the provisions of this and the following three sections shall apply to contracts of insurance for the benefit of preferred beneficiaries.\n(2) Where the contract of insurance or declaration provides that the insurance money or part thereof, or the interest thereof, shall be for the benefit of a preferred beneficiary or preferred beneficiaries such contract or declaration shall, subject to the right of the assured to apportion or alter as hereinafter provided, create a trust in favour of such beneficiary or beneficiaries, and so long as any object of the trust remains the money payable under the contract shall not be subject to the control of the assured, or of his creditors, or form part of his estate, but this shall not interfere with any transfer or pledge of the contract to any person prior to such declaration.\nSections 171 and 178 were by sec. 170 made applicable to all contracts of insurance of the person and declarations whether made before or after the passing of the Act.\nThe contract which the insured himself made with the insurance company was in favour of his wife, and as a wife was one of the class of preferred beneficiaries named in the statute at the time of the making of the contract, the statute operated upon the contract which the insured made and gave effect to the contract as a statutory trust in favour of the wife as beneficiary, and the statute provided that the moneys payable under the contract should not be subject to the control of the insured or of his creditors or form part of his estate. The contention of the appellant, as Committee of the insured, is that this trust has been destroyed by subsequent statutory enactments. Clearly it would require very plain and precise language in a subsequent statute to destroy the trust created at the time of the issue of the policy. It becomes necessary, therefore, for us to examine carefully the subsequent statutory provisions upon which counsel for the appellant relies.\nIn 1922, by 12-13 Geo. V, ch. 61, certain amendments were made to the Ontario Insurance Act. Accident and sickness insurance were defined by sec. 2 as follows:\u2014\n2. (1a) \u201cAccident Insurance\u201d shall mean insurance against loss arising from accident to the person of the insured.\n(51a) \u201cSickness Insurance\u201d shall mean insurance other than Life insurance against loss through sickness or disability of the insured not arising from accident or old age.\nThe Act of 1922 introduced by sec. 12 statutory provisions relating to accident and sickness insurance by adding certain sections, of which 190a (1) and 190c (1) and (2) are material to the question involved in this appeal.\n190a. (1) Sections 190a to 190h inclusive shall apply to accident and sickness insurance and to an insurer undertaking accident and sickness insurance in the Province but shall not apply to any fraternal society or to its contracts.\n190c. (1) The conditions set forth in this section shall be deemed, subject to the provisions of sections 190d, 190e, and 190f, to be part of every contract of accident and of sickness insurance in force in Ontario, and shall be printed on every policy hereafter issued under the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions.\u201d\n(2) An insurer may renew an existing contract of insurance by issue of a renewal receipt on which is printed in conspicuous type, \u201cThis policy is subject to the Statutory Conditions respecting contracts of Accident and Sickness Insurance contained in Section 190c of The Ontario Insurance Act.\nOnly one of the statutory conditions referred to in sec. 190c appears to be material and is as follows:\u2014\nSTATUTORY CONDITION 19\nSubject to the laws of the Province in which this contract is made, the insured may, without the consent of the beneficiary assign the policy and may, from time to time, change the beneficiary or revoke the benefits thereof, or make it entirely payable to himself or to his estate, pro- vided that if the beneficiary is a preferred beneficiary under the statutes of the Province in which the contract is made, the rights of the insured and the beneficiaries hereunder shall be subject to such statutes.\nIt is admitted by counsel for the appellant that the amendments made in 1922 did not affect the trust declared by the statute in respect of the policy in question, but reference is made to these amendments for the purpose of better understanding subsequent amendments which, it is argued, have a destructive effect upon the trust created in favour of the wife as preferred beneficiary by the statute as it stood at the date of the issue of the policy. It may be observed in passing that while sec. 190c of the 1922 amendments provided that the conditions set forth in that section shall be deemed to be part of every contract of accident and of sickness insurance \u201cin force\u201d in Ontario, the section specifically states that the conditions shall be printed on every policy \u201chereafter issued\u201d and that\nan insurer may renew an existing contract of insurance by issue of a renewal receipt on which is printed in conspicuous type \u201cThis policy is subject to the Statutory Conditions respecting contracts of Accident and Sickness Insurance contained in section 190c of The Ontario Insurance Act.\u201d\nIt is admitted that in this case no renewal receipts were issued; the policy continued in force from year to year merely by virtue of the payment of the annual premium of $100. It should be observed further that statutory condition 19 carefully preserved the rights of preferred beneficiaries.\nThen in 1924, by 14 Geo. V, Ch. 50, the Ontario Insurance Act separated the provisions relating to life insurance from the provisions relating to accident and sickness insurance, the former being put under Part V and the latter under Part VII of the Act. Under Part VII we find by sec. 177 (3) that, except where inconsistent with the provisions of Part VII or with any statutory policy condition required to be inserted in contracts of accident and sickness insurance, the provisions of Part V relating to contracts of life insurance, except subsection 2 of sec. 122 and sec. 123 (not here material), shall apply mutatis mutandis to contracts of accident and sickness insurance. Sec. 180 under Part VII sets forth certain conditions which \u201cshall be deemed, subject to the provisions of secs. 181 to 185, to be part of every contract of accident and of sickness insurance in force in Ontario\u201d and shall be printed on every policy \u201chereafter issued\u201d under the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions.\u201d Sections 181 to 185 do not affect this case. Statutory condition no. 19 remained the same as in the 1922 Act. By sec. 275 of the 1924 statute the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act, being Ch. 183 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, were repealed.\nCounsel for the appellant contends that sec. 114, which comes under Part V, applies to accident and sickness insurance by virtue of sec. 177 (3). The material portions of sec. 114 are as follows:\u2014\n114. (1) Notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary, this Part shall apply to every contract of life insurance made in the Province after the coming into force of this Part, and any term in any such contract inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall be null and void.\n(2) Unless hereinafter otherwise specifically provided, this Part shall apply to the unmatured obligations of every contract of life insurance made in the Province before the coming into force of this Part.\nBut the provisions of Part V are not made to apply to contracts of accident and sickness insurance where they are \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the provisions of Part VII (sec. 177 (3)). It seems to me doubtful if sec. 114 relating to every contract of life insurance made in the province after the coming into force of Part V can be said to be consistent with the provisions of Part VII which relate to accident and sickness insurance, but in any event sec. 114 (1) clearly refers only to contracts made \u201cafter the coming into force\u201d of Part V (i.e., 1924) and cannot apply to the contract with which we are concerned that was made in 1920. Sec. 114 (2) presents some difficulty in that it provides that Part V shall apply \u201cto the unmatured obligations\u201d of every contract of life insurance made in the province \u201cbefore the coming into force\u201d of this Part. Again it seems doubtful to me if that subsection, limited to contracts of life insurance made before the coming into force of the section, can be read to apply to the accident or sickness policy with which we are concerned, and what is the exact import of the words \u201cunmatured obligations\u201d is not plain. There is, at any rate, no such precise language used in any of the changes made in the 1924 statute as would destroy the plain statutory trust created in favour of the wife as beneficiary of the policy in question, particularly when the provisions relating to preferred beneficiaries (secs. 134, 135, 136 and 139) remained substantially the same as in the prior legislation, definitely creating a trust in favour of the designated beneficiary and providing that the insurance money shall not be subject to the control of the insured or of his creditors or form part of the estate of the insured.\nIn 1928, by 18 Geo. V, Chap. 35, further amendments were made to the Ontario Insurance Act, and counsel for the appellant particularly points to these amendments as effective to extinguish any statutory trust or trusts created in relation to policies of sickness or accident insurance such as we are concerned with in this appeal. The Ontario statutes had been revised in 1927, the Insurance Act being Chap. 222. Section 177 of the 1924 Act became sec. 184 in the revised statute. By sec. 4 of the 1928 statute, subsections 2 and 3 of sec. 184 were repealed and others substituted therefor. New subsection 4 of sec. 184 reads:\u2014\n(4) Sections 122, 133 to 138 and 161 shall apply to contracts to which this Part applies.\nThe effect was that the provision found in the 1924 Act whereby, except where inconsistent with the provisions of Part VII or with any statutory policy condition required to be inserted in contracts of accident and sickness insurance, the provisions of Part V relating to contracts of life insurance, except subsection 2 of sec. 122 and sec. 123, should apply mutatis mutandis to contracts of accident and sickness insurance, was stricken out. By new sec. 184 (4), only sections 122, 133 to 138 and 161 under Part V remained applicable to contracts to which Part VII applies, and none of these sections is material here. The 1928 statute, moreover, repealed (by sec. 6 (2) thereof) condition 19 and substituted the following therefor:\n19. Where moneys are payable under this policy upon the death of the insured by accident, the insured may from time to time designate a beneficiary, appoint, appropriate or apportion such moneys and alter or revoke any prior designation, appointment, appropriation or apportionment.\nThis change in the wording of statutory condition 19 is the real point of emphasis made by counsel for the appellant. The contention is that the former right to designate preferred beneficiaries of sickness and accident policies was expressly taken away except where moneys under such policies are payable in the event of the death of the insured by accident. Upon the language of this amendment it is argued that the wife in the policy we have to consider is no longer a beneficiary within the statute, and this argument is based upon the contention that there is now no right by statute, the policy not providing for the death of the insured by accident, to designate a beneficiary. It is further argued that we must read new condition 19, as it appears in the 1928 statute, with the provisions of sec. 180 in the 1924 statute (now sec. 187 of the Revised Statutes) as a condition which \u201cshall be deemed, subject to the provisions of sections 181 to 185, to be part of every contract of accident and of sickness insurance in force in Ontario.\u201d Sections 181 to 185 in the 1924 statute are now sections 188 to 192 of the Revised Statutes of 1927 and are not material here. We have observed, however, that the words \u201cin force in Ontario\u201d in sec. 180 (now sec. 187) are immediately followed by the words \u201cand shall be printed on every policy hereafter issued under the heading \u2018Statutory Conditions\u2019.\u201d\nIn 1931 (21 Geo. V, Ch. 49) the Insurance Act was further amended and sec. 11 (2) added the words \u201cand no other provisions contained in Part V,\u201d after the figures 161 in subsection 4 of sec. 184 as enacted by sec. 4 of The Insurance Act, 1928. The subsection now reads:\u2014\nSections 122, 133 to 138 and 161 and no other provisions contained in Part V shall apply to contracts to which this Part applies.\nThe insertion of the words \u201cand no other provisions contained in Part V\u201d did not add anything to the amendment of 1928; it was plain enough that only sections 122, 133 to 138 and 161 under Part V thereafter should apply to contracts to which Part VII applied.\nIt is impossible, on the general language of the subsequent amendments relied upon by counsel for the appellant, to reach the conclusion that the Legislature by such amendments destroyed or intended to destroy the statutory trust created in 1920 in favour of the wife as the designated preferred beneficiary of the policy in question and the statutory provision that \u201cso long as any object of the trust remains the money payable under the contract shall not be subject to the control of the assured, or of his creditors, or form part of his estate.\u201d There might be some support for such a contention were the policy an annual renewal policy rather than a continuous policy. The distinction between what is regarded as a continuous policy and what is regarded as a renewal policy in insurance law is clearly established. For instance, a policy of life insurance usually contemplates the insurance continuing until death; consequently, stipulations giving an absolute right of renewal are in the main confined to life policies, but the accident or sickness policy with which we have to deal in this appeal gives an absolute right of renewal until the insured is sixty years of age and contemplates the continuance of the insurance from year to year merely by the payment of the stipulated annual premium. Except in such cases of continuous insurance, policies are renewable only by mutual consent. The assured, if he wishes to renew the policy, may apply to the insurers for renewal and tender the renewal premium, but they are not bound to accept the renewal premium or renew the policy. Under the former type of policy, the contract is a continuing contract, inasmuch as it is made once and for all at the commencement of the insurance and is kept in force by the renewal. There is not a fresh contract on each renewal. On the other hand, where the policy is renewable only by mutual consent at the expiration of a stipulated period of time, the position is different. On each renewal there must be an agreement between the parties to renew the policy, and each renewal constitutes a fresh contract. See Halsbury (2nd ed.), Vol. XVIII, pp. 455-457. The distinction between continuing insurance and a renewal policy becomes of importance in considering changes in a general statute governing policies of insurance. One can quite understand that, where you have in law a fresh contract with each renewal, the statutory provisions in force at the date of each renewal may operate upon the contract made at the time, but where you have, as in this case, a contract of continuous insurance made in 1920 and kept alive merely by the payment of the stipulated annual premium until the date of the event insured against, it requires very clear and precise language in general amendments to destroy a statutory trust created in favour of a named beneficiary at the time the policy was taken out. There is a good deal of difficulty in determining exactly what is the full effect to be given to the amendments to the Ontario Insurance Act discussed before us. To a certain extent they may have been intended to have retrospective effect, but when the language is not plain the new law ought to be construed so as to interfere as little as possible with vested rights and should not be given a larger retrospective power than one can plainly see the legislature intended. This was the view taken by Lord Bowen in Reid v. Reid[2], where he said:\u2014\nNow the particular rule of construction which has been referred to, but which is valuable only when the words of an Act of Parliament are not plain, is embodied in the well\u2011known trite maxim omnis nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non pr\u0153teritis, that is, that except in special cases the new law ought to be construed so as to interfere as little as possible with vested rights. It seems to me that even in construing an Act which is to a certain extent retrospective, and in construing a section which is to a certain extent retrospective, we ought nevertheless to bear in mind that maxim as applicable whenever we reach the line at which the words of the section cease to be plain. That is a necessary and logical corollary of the general proposition that you ought not to give a larger retrospective power to a section, even in an Act which is to some extent intended to be retrospective, than you can plainly see the legislature meant.\nThere is no such language in the amendments to the Ontario Insurance Act upon which counsel for the appellant relies to justify the contention that the statutory trust in respect of the policy before us has been extinguished.\nThat is sufficient to dispose of the appeal and to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the wife is entitled to the proceeds of the policy. But the Court of Appeal rested its judgment, not only upon the ground that the subsequent amendments to the statute did not destroy the trust, but also upon the ground that\nwhatever may have been the case before the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, since that Act when such a policy as this is issued with the wife named as the beneficiary, while she may not sue the insurer in her own name, the insurance money when received by the husband or his representatives is held in trust for her.\nIt must be observed, however, that sec. 11 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, Imperial Statutes (1882) 45-46 Vic., ch. 75, was limited to \u201ca policy of assurance effected by any man on his own life\u201d and did not extend to a policy of sickness or accident insurance. Further, when the Married Women\u2019s Property Act was carried into the Ontario Statutes in 1884 (by 47 Vic, ch. 19), sec 11 of the Imperial Act was not reproduced. A similar provision appeared, however, in the 1884 Statutes of Ontario, ch. 20 thereof being \u201cAn Act to Secure to Wives and Children the Benefit of Life Insurance,\u201d but here again the statute was limited to life insurance. This latter Act was repealed in 1897 by 60 Vic, ch. 36, and thereafter became part of the Insurance Act, and as such was carried forward in the Insurance Acts from time to time until 1912 when, by omitting the preliminary words \u201cwhen a person effects insurance on his or her own life * * * \u201d, the preferred beneficiary provisions first became applicable to accident and sickness insurance policies. It was not, then, by virtue of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, but by virtue of the 1912 Ontario Insurance Act, that a husband could effect accident or sickness insurance for the benefit of his wife.\nIt becomes unnecessary for us to consider the further interesting and rather difficult point raised during the argument as to whether or not, apart from the statute, the insurance moneys, to the extent to which they have reached the hands of the Committee, are impressed with a trust in favour of the wife by reason of the terms of the application of the insured to the company for the policy. In the Maybrick case[3], the moneys had never reached the insured or his legal representative and the point was not really in issue.\nThere is a cross-appeal by the wife from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as the judgment treats the Committee as the person lawfully entitled to enforce and collect upon the policy. The wife contends that, as designated preferred beneficiary, she is entitled herself under the statute to recover these insurance moneys direct from the insurance company without the intervention of the Committee. She obviously fears an abstraction from the monthly payments of the regular fees and disbursements of the Committee as a trustee, if the judgment remains whereby the trust company as Committee is declared not only to have been the proper recipient of the moneys already paid but the person entitled to collect all future payments, though bound upon receipt thereof to turn them over to the wife.\nThis Court decided in National Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. McCoubrey[4] that the widow, as preferred beneficiary of a life policy, was entitled to payment of the insurance moneys from the insurance company without the appointment of a legal representative of her\n[Page164]\ndeceased husband where there was no notice or knowledge on the part of the company of any change of beneficiary. The insurance company there insisted that the will of the deceased should be probated before payment could be made to the widow. Having determined in the present case that the wife as designated preferred beneficiary is entitled under the statute to the moneys under the policy with which we are now dealing, it follows that she is entitled to the moneys direct from the company and the order below should be varied accordingly. The insurance company not being a party to these proceedings, our judgment is, of course, only a declaration of right as between the Committee and the wife.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, and the cross-appeal allowed by varying the judgment appealed from to provide for payment over by the appellant to the respondent, without deduction, of the total amount received by the appellant as proceeds of the policy in question, and by declaring that the respondent is entitled, as between her and the appellant, to enforce the policy. The appellant must pay the respondent all her costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McRuer, Mason, Cameron & Brewin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Jennings & Clute.\n[1] [1935] 2 D.L.R. 329; [1935] Ont.

On December 15, 1909, the Calgary Y.M.C.A. mortgaged its leasehold of certain lands to the Standard Trusts Company to secure the payment of a loan of $25,000, the terms of payment and interest being set out in the mortgage indenture. As an added security, the respondent Hutchings, the deceased Hugh Neilson and 13 other individuals executed a bond, on the same date, in favour of the mortgagee, for due payment and performance by the Y.M.C.A. It was stipulated in the bond that if the Y.M.C.A. \"shall pay * * * to the said The Standard Trusts Company * * * the sum of $25,000 * * * with interest thereon the days and times and in the manner called for in the mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof provided and shall further fully perform all covenants and conditions contained in the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof, no matter what dealings the said company may have had with the mortgagors or any one interested in the said lands (the intention being that the above obligation shall remain in full force and virtue as long as any money remains unpaid under the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof) then the above bond or obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\" The mortgage moneys were repayable with interest at 7 per cent per annum and the final payment of principal and interest was due and payable on January 2, 1915. The mortgage and moneys secured thereby were assigned and transferred to the appellant company. The Y.M.C.A. defaulted a number of its payments and negotiated with the appellant for an extension of time and eventually an agreement was reached and reduced to writing on June 29, 1915, whereby time for final payment under the mortgage was extended to April 1, 1918, and the rate of interest was increased from 7 per cent. to 8 per cent.; and a renewal agreement with similar clauses was also negotiated. The sureties were not consulted in the negotiations for the extension and renewal agreements and were not parties to them; but the appellant company prepared a document which was signed by 13 of the 15 bondsmen, among whom were the respondents Hutchings and Neilson, but not until late November or December, 1915. This document purported to acknowledge notice of the assignment of the mortgage and the bond and also notice of the extension agreement. No proceedings upon the mortgage, upon the agreements or upon the bond were taken by the appellant company until March 27, 1934, when an action was brought against the respondent Hutchings and later, on April 9, 1934, a similar action was taken against the legal representatives of the deceased Neilson.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division, ([1935] 2 W.W.R. 338), that the respondents Hutchings and Neilson were not liable. The change in the rate of interest was a material variation in the original contract, the performance of which the sureties had guaranteed by their bond, and operated in law in extinguishment of their liability. A renewal or extension with an increased rate of interest was not a renewal or extension within the contemplation of the parties to the bond.\nAs to the appellant's contention that the words in the bond \"no matter what dealings the said company may have had with the mortgagors * * \" permitted the change of the rate of interest and that the respondents cannot complain of the alteration, reading the instrument as a whole, those words must be confined in their meaning and effect to dealings with matter collateral to the contract and cannot be extended to matters inconsistent with or repugnant to the very contract, the performance of which the sureties have guaranteed: an increase in the rate of interest is not something collateral to but a definite alteration of a material part of the original contract. The parties expressed in that clause their intention that the obligation of the bond shall remain as long as any money remains unpaid under the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof. The words of that clause cannot be construed to entitle the creditor to make a new contract with the principal debtor and still hold the sureties on the bond given in respect of the original contract.\nAs to the written acknowledgments signed by the respondents Hutchings and Neilson, it is settled law that a surety is not discharged by a variation to which he assents afterwards, even though there may be no fresh consideration for the assent, where it is not the creation of a new debt but the revival of an old debt; but, whether the assent is given previous to or subsequent to a variation, the creditor must put the surety in possession of all the facts likely to affect the degree of his responsibility, and if he neglects to do so, it is at his peril; and the evidence in this case does not establish that the sureties ever knew the real facts and circumstances surrounding the making of what are described as the extension and renewal agreements, or that they knew that two of their co-sureties had not assented to the variation in the contract; the original bond was the joint and several obligation of the 15 sureties and each surety had a contractual right of contribution against the others apart altogether from his equitable right as a surety; that discharge of these co-sureties was something that those who were asked to remain in the bond were entitled to know.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J.[2] and dismissing the appellant company's action.\nE. D. Arnold, for the appellant.\nH. G. Nolan K.C. for the respondent The Royal Trust Company.\nL. H. Mayhood for the respondent Hutchings.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This appeal arises out of consolidated actions brought by a mortgagee against certain sureties upon a bond given to secure the payment of the mortgage debt and interest. The appellant, Holland-Canada Mortgage Company Limited, acting at the time through its investment agent, The Standard Trusts Company, made a loan on or about December 15, 1909, to the Calgary Young Men's Christian Association (hereafter for convenience called the Association) of the sum of $25,000 repayable $2,000 on January 2 in each of the years 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914 and the balance thereof on January 2, 1915, with interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum half-yearly on the 2nd days of January and July of each year. To secure repayment of the moneys the Association mortgaged to the said Standard Trusts Company its leasehold lands in the city of Calgary and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, which was the owner of the lands, joined in the mortgage to perfect the security but expressly exempted itself from the covenant to pay.\nConcurrently with the giving of the mortgage fifteen citizens of the city of Calgary executed and delivered to The Standard Trusts Company a bond guaranteeing the repayment by the Association of the moneys borrowed and interest thereon. As early as January 2, 1914, the Association became definitely in default under the mortgage. The Standard Trusts Company transferred the mortgage to the appellant on June 3, 1915, and assigned the bond to the appellant on August 20, 1915. Subsequently (the exact date is for the moment unimportant) two agreements were made between the appellant, the Association and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. One of these agreements, described as an extension agreement, was dated June 29, 1915, and the other agreement, described as a renewal agreement, was dated June 30, 1915, but the evidence shews that it was not until Sept. 22, 1915, that these agreements became finally executed by all parties and completed. The sureties were not consulted in the negotiations for these agreements and were not parties to them. A form of document, described as an acknowledgment, to which I shall later refer was subsequently circulated among the sureties and ultimately thirteen out of the fifteen sureties signed separate documents of like effect.\nBy the extension agreement it was recited that the Association on January 2, 1915, owed the appellant $19,000 principal and $467.30 interest and that the said sums with interest thereon remained unpaid. The agreement provided that the said $19,000 should be repayable as follows: $500 on the first days of April and October in each of the years 1916 and 1917 and the balance on the first day of April, 1918, with interest thereon from the second day of January, 1915, at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum payable half-yearly on the first days of April and October in each year. It was declared and agreed that all the covenants, clauses, conditions, powers, matters and things contained in the mortgage should apply and relate to the extended dates of payment as fully and in the same manner as if the same had been the dates of payment fixed in and by the said mortgage, excepting that there should be no right of premature repayment except as in the agreement stated and that any statutory right in that behalf should take effect as if the said mortgage had been dated on the date of the agreement. It was further expressly declared and agreed that these presents\nshall not create any merger or alter or prejudice the rights and priorities of the company as against any surety, subsequent encumbrancer or other person interested in the said lands or liable in whole or in part for the moneys secured by said mortgage and not a party hereto, or the rights of any such surety, subsequent encumbrancer or other person, all of which rights are hereby reserved.\nBy the renewal agreement dated one day after the date of the extension agreement, the principal of the mortgage is recited to be $19,500 instead of $19,000. The evidence shews that that sum was arrived at by taking $500 of the arrears of interest and treating it henceforth as principal, making the new principal $19,500, which sum was by the terms of this agreement made payable $500 on the first days of April and October in each of the years 1916 and 1917 and the balance on the first day of April, 1918, with interest from January 2, 1915, at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum payable half-yearly on the first days of April and October in each year. The Association expressly covenanted with the appellant \"to pay the said principal money and interest on the days and in the manner above set out.\" Then followed in this agreement the exact language used in the extension agreement relating the covenants in the mortgage to the extended dates of payment and reserving the rights of the appellant against any surety. The somewhat cumbersome procedure adopted in making two agreements appears to have been first to extend payment of the principal and interest, both in arrears, and then to create a new principal sum and provide new terms for repayment. One of the contentions of counsel for the respondents was that the second agreement with its express covenant to pay, taken in the light of the appellant's letters referring to the \"new loan,\" operated to extinguish the original debt and gave place to a new debt. I shall not stop at the moment to consider that contention.\nNo proceedings upon the mortgage or upon either of these agreements or upon the bond appear to have been taken by the appellant until March 27, 1934, when the appellant commenced an action against the respondent Hutchings, one of the signatories to the bond given by the fifteen citizens of Calgary in 1909 to secure the payment of the mortgage indebtedness then incurred. On April 9, 1934, the appellant commenced a similar action against the legal representatives of one Neilson, deceased, who had died in 1918, and who, with Hutchings, had been one of the fifteen signatories to the bond. No action has been taken against any of the other signatories to the bond. During the nineteen years intervening between the date of the renewal agreement and the commencement of these actions the matter seems to have been allowed to drift along without any one taking any definite action to enforce payment by the Association. The Association obviously had faced a good deal of difficulty in raising money from time to time to pay upon the mortgage and the mortgagee seems to have kept nursing the account from year to year.\nBy order of the Court the Hutchings action was stayed, on April 23, 1934, until the appellant should commence action on the mortgage against the Association and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to enforce the security. The appellant then amended its statement of claim in the Hutchings action to include a mortgage action and the Hutchings and the Neilson actions were consolidated. Subsequently on November 19, 1934, the appellant obtained an order nisi against the Association and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company upon the mortgage with a six months' period for redemption. The consolidated actions then proceeded to trial against Hutchings and the Neilson estate upon the bond.\nBefore discussing the judgments in the courts below it is well to understand the issues involved. Much turns upon the exact language of the bond itself and it is convenient now to set out the bond in full:\nKnow all men by these presents, that we, William George Hunt, manager; Robert John Hutchings, manager; Absalom Judson Sayre, manager; Archibald John McArthur, gentleman; George Thomas Calendar Robinson, merchant; Albert William Ward, merchant; George Allan Anderson, physician; John Niblock, superintendent; John Edward Irvine, agent; Charles Allan Stuart, judge; John Henry Hannah, merchant; Alfred Price, superintendent; Thomas Underwood, contractor; Hugh Neilson, merchant; Fred Fishenden Higgs, merchant, all of the city of Calgary, in the province of Alberta, are jointly and severally held and firmly bound unto The Standard Trusts Company, in the penal sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, to be paid to the said Standard Trusts Company, their successors or assigns, for which payment well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves our and each of our heirs, executors and administrators and every one of them firmly by these presents.\nSealed with our seals and dated this 15th day of December, A.D. 1909.\nWhereas that the Calgary Young Men's Christian Association have given a mortgage for the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, dated 15th day of December, 1909, and registered in the Calgary Land Titles Office as no. 2431, to The Standard Trusts Company, on the following property in the city of Calgary in the province of Alberta, and being all that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's station grounds described as follows: Commencing at the southeast corner of First street East and Ninth avenue, thence easterly along the south limit of Ninth avenue one hundred and fifty feet thence southerly at right angles to the first mentioned course one hundred feet, thence westerly parallel to and one hundred feet distant from the first mentioned course one hundred and fifty feet to the east limit of First street East, thence northerly along the east limit of First street East one hundred feet to the point of commencement containing 0\u00b734 acre.\nNow the condition of the above obligation is such that if the said Calgary Young Men's Christian Association, their successors or assigns shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said The Standard Trusts Company, their successors or assigns the just and full sum of twenty-five thousand dollars of lawful money of Canada with interest thereon the days and times and in the manner called for in said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof provided and shall further fully perform all covenants, provisoes and conditions contained in the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof, no matter what dealings the said company may have had with the mortgagors, or any one interested in the said lands (the intention being that the above obligation shall remain in full force and virtue as long as any money remains unpaid under the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof) then the above bond or obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\nIt is significant that the full names and descriptions of each of the fifteen signatories are set out in the opening words of the bond. Obviously each one of those who signed the bond knew exactly how many sureties were joining with him and who they were. It is not unreasonable to infer that each undertook the obligation because the other fourteen joined with him. It was a joint as well as a several obligation.\nThe bond expressly provided for a renewal or extension of the mortgage. It is unnecessary it seems to me to discuss the rather technical point raised by counsel for the respondents that the use of the singular rather than the plural, i.e., \"any renewal or extension thereof,\" confined the right of renewal or extension to one and only one such transaction. The vital point is that the rate of interest, originally fixed by the mortgage at 7 per cent. per annum, was by the said agreements increased to 8 per cent. per annum. Apart from the questions raised by certain acknowledgments in writing alleged to have been given by the sureties, or some of them, to the appellant at or about the time of the making of the extension and renewal agreements and subject to the question of the effect of the particular language of the bond, the change in the rate of interest was a material variation in the original contract, the performance of which the sureties had guaranteed by their bond, and operated in law in extinguishment of the liability of the sureties. Counsel for the appellant relied upon the Woodcrafts case, Egbert v. Northern Crown Bank[3], for his proposition that a mere change of the rate of interest does not discharge the sureties but in so far as interest charges have been increased they do not bind the sureties. In the Woodcrafts case3, however, Lord Dunedin pointed out that the Bank had imposed a rate of interest that was prohibited by the Bank Act and the agreement betwen the Bank and its customer for payment of the increased rate was \"statutorily invalid and of no effect.\" A surety has always been a favoured creditor in the eyes of the law. His obligation is strictly examined and strictly enforced. \"It must always be recollected,\" said Lord Westbury in Blest v. Brown[4],\nin what manner a surety is bound. You bind him to the letter of his engagement. Beyond the proper interpretation of that engagement you have no hold upon him. He receives no benefit and no consideration. He is bound, therefore, merely according to the proper meaning and effect of the written engagement that he entered into. If that written engagement is altered in a single line, no matter whether it be altered for his benefit, no matter whether the alteration be innocently made, he has a right to say, \"The contract is no longer that for which I engaged to be surety: you have put an end to the contract that I guaranteed, and my obligation, therefore, is at an end.\"\nApart from any express stipulation to the contrary, where the change is in respect of a matter that cannot \"plainly be seen without inquiry to be unsubstantial or necessarily beneficial to the surety,\" to use the language of Rowlatt, The Law of Principal and Surety, 2nd ed. (1926) p. 102, the surety, if he has not consented to remain liable notwithstanding the alteration, will be discharged whether he is in fact prejudiced or not. Holme v. Brunskill[5]. It cannot be said to be self-evident that a change of the rate of interest on a debt of some $19,000 from 7 per cent. to 8 per cent. is unsubstantial or necessarily beneficial to the surety. This is not really disputed by the appellant. What is said is that a particular stipulation in the bond permitted this change and that the respondents cannot complain of the alteration. Our attention is directed by counsel for the appellant to the particular language of the particular bond where in the condition it is expressly stipulated,\nno matter what dealings the said company (i.e., the appellant) may have had with the mortgagors or anyone interested in the said lands. Counsel for the respondents observe that immediately following these words appear in brackets the further words\nthe intention being that the above obligation shall remain in full force and virtue as long as any money remains unpaid under the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof.\nWhat then is the meaning and effect to be given to the words \"no matter what dealings the company may have had with the mortgagors?\" They cannot be disregarded as meaningless. The parties expressed their intention, however, that the obligation of the bond shall remain as long as any money remains unpaid under the said mortgage or any renewal or extension thereof. The words in controversy cannot be construed to entitle the creditor to make a new contract with the principal debtor and still hold the sureties on the bond given in respect of the original contract.\nA renewal or extension with an increased rate of interest is not a renewal or extension within the contemplation of the parties to the bond. The peculiar language relied upon to hold the sureties notwithstanding a material alteration of the original contract, is not susceptible of the interpretation put upon it by counsel for the appellant. Reading the instrument as a whole, the particular phrase must be confined in its meaning and effect to dealings with matters collateral to the contract, and cannot fairly be extended to matters inconsistent with or repugnant to the very contract, the performance of which the sureties have guaranteed. One can well appreciate collateral dealings between mortgagor and mortgagee that leave the contract itself alone; matters either contemplated by the parties in the original mortgage transaction or incidentally arising throughout the currency of the mortgage. It is sufficient for the purpose of this case to say that an increase in the rate of interest is not something collateral to but a definite alteration of a material part of the original contract.\nBut the appellant, in any event, relies upon written acknowledgments from Hutchings and Neilson which, it is contended, constitute assent by them to the alteration. It is not proved, however, that either of their acknowledgments was given before Sept. 22, 1915, the date of the completion and delivery of the extension and renewal agreements, and the respondents argue that such an acknowledge- ment or assent given without consideration subsequent to a change that operated to discharge the surety cannot revive the debt.\nBut it has long been settled law that a surety is not discharged by a variation to which he assents afterwards, even though there may be no fresh consideration for the assent, where it is not the creation of a new debt but the revival of an old debt. Mayhew v. Crickett[6]; Smith v. Winter[7]; Rowlatt, 2nd ed., 118. And yet whether the assent be given previous to or subsequent to a variation, the creditor must put the surety in possession of all the facts likely to affect the degree of his responsibility and if he neglects to do so, it is at his peril: Pidcock v. Bishop[8]. Lord Loughborough, in Rees v. Berrington[9] stated the rule thus:\nIt is the clearest and most evident equity not to carry on any transaction without the privity of him (the surety) who must necessarily have a concern in every transaction with the principal debtor. You cannot keep him bound and transact his affairs (for they are as much his as your own) without consulting him.\nLord Hanworth, in Smith v. Wood[10] pointed out that this rule stated by Lord Loughborough was followed in Holme v. Brunskill[11] and he applied it to the facts of the case before him. Now what were the special facts of the arrangement made between the mortgagor and the mortgagee in September, 1915, in the case before us? Five hundred dollars of arrears of interest were capitalized so as to fix the capital amount at $19,500; the rate of interest was increased from 7 per cent. to 8 per cent. per annum and made retroactive to January 2, 1915; the interest dates were changed from January and July to April and October; the instalments of principal were made payable thereafter $500 half-yearly instead of $2,000 yearly; and the whole debt and interest was to be paid off by April 1, 1918. This transaction, which was described by the mortgagee in its correspondence as \"the new loan,\" cannot be treated as a mere renewal or extension; it involved, if not a new loan, a substantial variation or alteration of the original contract.\nWhile I cannot accept the contention of counsel for the respondents that there was the creation of a new debt and the extinguishment of the old debt, there were such material changes in the original contract as to call for full disclosure to the sureties and assent to such changes if the sureties were to be rendered liable for the contract as varied. It is not suggested, much less proved, in evidence that the sureties ever knew the real facts and circumstances surrounding the making of what are described as the extension and renewal agreements. Two of the fifteen sureties never gave any acknowledgment and the authority of the agent who purported to sign for Hutchings is denied by Hutchings. But in any event the acknowledgment is merely this, that\nI have received notice that said Holland-Canada Mortgage Company Limited has entered into an agreement with the said Young Men's Christian Association whereby the time for repayment for the said mortgage has been extended for a term of five years at the rate of interest of 8 per cent per annum, and I agree that said bond so executed by me shall be and remain binding on me notwithstanding said extension or said increase of rate of interest.\nIt is not established by the evidence that either Hutchings or Neilson knew of the real transaction between the mortgagor and the mortgagee and assented to it, nor is it attempted to be shewn that Hutchings or Neilson knew that two of their co-sureties, Niblock and Irvine, had not assented to the variation in the contract. The original bond was the joint and several obligation of the fifteen sureties and each surety had a contractual right of contribution against the others apart altogether from his equitable right as a surety. The discharge of these two co-sureties was something that those who were asked to remain on the bond were entitled to know.\nBut it is said that both the extension and renewal agreements reserved the rights of the sureties by express language in the instruments. It is quite a different matter, however, to reserve the rights against the surety in an agreement merely extending the time for payment and to reserve the rights against the surety in an agreement materially altering the old contract. This was clearly pointed out by Street J. in Bristol and West of England Land Mortgage and Investment Company v. Taylor[12] where he said at p. 296 that\nthe words reserving the creditor's rights against the surety, however effectual they may be in so far as the extension of time is concerned, are mere \"idle words\" in so far as any effect upon the stipulation for an increased rate of interest is concerned. We were asked by counsel for the appellant to decline to follow that case upon the ground that it was not rightly decided. That was a decision of the Queen's Bench Division in Ontario over forty years ago. We entirely agree with the views expressed in that case by Street J. and the decision may well be regarded as settled law.\nA great deal of correspondence between the parties to the original transaction was put in at the trial and the appellant endeavoured to shew from some of it that Hutchings and Neilson had, quite independently of the form of acknowledgment, by later correspondence acknowledged their liability on the bond. I have read carefully the correspondence put in at the trial and having regard to all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions as hereinbefore related I do not find any such admission of liability as to entitle the appellant to judgment against either Hutchings or the estate of Neilson. This was the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge and was affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nIt is unnecessary therefore to consider the questions raised during the argument on the defence that the actions were barred by the running of time. It is obvious that the appellant would encounter a good deal of difficulty in this respect having regard to the facts that the bond was given on October 15, 1909, default on the mortgage occurred as early as January, 1914, and suit was not entered till March, 1934. Had we considered the appropriate statutory provisions of Alberta governing the limitation of time for the commencement of these actions, the appellant might well have been found to have been barred but we have thought it better to consider and discuss the appeal upon the broad ground of liability without reference to any statutory bar of the actions.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1935] 2 W.W.R. 338.\n[2] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 133.\n[3] [1918] A.C. 903.\n3 [1918] A.C. 903.\n[4] (1862) 4 De G.

(Arts. 1600 and seq. C.C.). Therefore the intention of the legislature and of the Civil Code in using the words \u201ctacit renewal\u201d in connection with the lease and hire of work or personal services in article 1667 C.C., was that it should convey the same meaning, carry the same effect and be governed by the same rules, mutatis mutandis, as tacit renewal operating in the case of a contract for lease or hire of things. Accordingly, under article 1667 C.C., as under article 1609 C.C., tacit renewal will operate in the case of lease or hire of work or personal services if the lessee continues to give his services beyond the expiration of the term originally fixed, without any opposition or notice on the part of the lessor; and applying the terms of article 1609 C.C., in such a case, the lessor, or servant, will not have the right thereafter to leave the service of the master, or the master will not have the right to dismiss the servant unless notice has been given within the delay required by law.\nAs to the length of such notice, the provisions of article 1657 and 1642 C.C. relating to lease or hire of things, may be made applicable to the lease or hire of work or personal services.\nAsbestos Corporation Ltd. v. Cook, ([1933] S.C.R. 86) has no application to the present litigation. That case was not dealing with the question of tacit renewal, but with a contract of lease for personal services for an undetermined period of time. Even that contract could not be terminated without giving a notice of a reasonable delay.\nAlso: although it had been held in the Asbestos case that article 1642 C.C. was not applicable to a lease of personal services for the purpose of determining the length of the contract, it has not been decided in that case that article 1642 C.C. could not be applied to leases of personal services, in so far as it is referred to in article 1657 C.C., for the purpose of computing the delay of the notice required to terminate a contract prolonged by tacit renewal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Greenshields C.J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action for damages for wrongful dismissal from the respondent company\u2019s employ.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nF. P. Brais K.C. for the appellant.\nC. A. Hale K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant was manager for Canada, chief agent and chief attorney of the respondent company. He had assumed this office on or about the end of October, 1928, under an agreement entered into between the parties in Montreal. Under the terms of the agreement, the services of the appellant were retained for one year from December 1, 1928, at a salary of $6,500 per annum; but it was understood that, both sides being satisfied with the results obtained, the salary for the year 1930 would be $7,500.\nIt was also then and there expressly agreed that the appellant would receive an additional compensation of 10 per cent, based on certain items of \u201cincome and outgo,\u201d more particularly described in the memorandum accepted and initialed by the appellant and also by the respondent through its president and secretary.\nAt the end of the year 1929, both parties were apparently satisfied of the results obtained, for the appellant continued in the service of the respondent at the higher salary of $7,500 per annum.\nThe contract was silent as to the terms of payment of the salary. It can be said, however, with certainty that during the time the appellant was in the employ of the respondent he received his payment in fortnightly amounts.\nAs a matter of fact, at the trial, the secretary of the respondent testified that this arrangement as to the period at which the appellant should receive his salary was made when the contract was first entered into. There was a controversy on that point, the appellant swearing that the drawing of his salary was entirely left to himself, although, as a matter of convenience, he usually drew it every two weeks. The trial judge, interpreting this evidence, held that the appellant\u2019s salary was\npayable by the year and only at the expiration of a year of services.\nOn the contrary, the Court of King\u2019s Bench found\nque, d\u2019apr\u00e9s la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9i faite \u00e0 ce sujet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu d\u00e9s le debut que le salaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui serait payable tous les quinze jours.\nIn the result, the divergence of views on this question of fact is the true basis of the difference in the conclusion reached by each court in this case.\nBut before we discuss them, we must complete our statement of the facts.\nAs already mentioned, at the expiration of the first year of services, to wit, on December 1, 1929, the appellant continued in the employ of the respondent. For the year 1930, the appellant was paid at the rate of $7,500 per annum, the contract in other respects remaining the same, in full force and effect.\nAt the expiration of the second year (December 1, 1930), and again at the expiration of the third year (December 1, 1931), the relations between the parties continued as they were; when, on October 21, 1932, the respondent company, through its secretary, notified the appellant that his services would no longer be required, at the same time informing him that his salary would be paid until December 1, 1932.\nThe appellant took exception to the respondent\u2019s action, expressed his willingness to continue in his position and to abide by and carry out his contract until December 1, 1933. But the respondent having persisted in the stand already taken, the appellant left the employ of the respondent; and, in due course, brought this action to recover the sum of $7,012.50, for what he alleged to be an illegal and an unjustified cancellation of his contract of engagement.\nThe defence was that the contract, under its terms and by force of law, expired on December 1, 1932; and that the respondent had refused to renew it and had expressly notified the appellant accordingly on October 21, 1932, a prior notice which was usual, reasonable and lawful. Moreover, the refusal to renew the contract for another year had been accepted and acquiesced in by the appellant. But, in addition to these formal grounds of defence, the respondent alleged it had refused to renew the contract for good, valid and sufficient cause the particulars of which were given in the plea.\nBoth courts in the province of Quebec refused to entertain the alleged grounds of acquiescence on the part of the appellant and of dismissal for cause. They were not renewed at bar in this Court and they may be taken for abandoned to all intents and purposes.\nThe Superior Court maintained the appellant\u2019s action to the amount of $5,312.50 for the reason mainly that, in the view that the Court took of the contract, the appellant\u2019s salary was payable by the year and, consequently, a notice of at least three months was necessary and required to put an end to the contract and relieve the respondent from a claim in damages.\nOn the other hand, the Court of King\u2019s Bench thought the evidence clearly showed that the salary was payable fortnightly and, accordingly, a notice of fifteen days prior to the 1st December, 1932, was amply sufficient to prevent the tacit renewal of the contract for another year. Moreover, the Court expressed the opinion it might even be held that no notice whatsoever was required, since, in the state of the law in the province of Quebec, the contract expired of its own terms on the 1st December, 1932. The appeal was, therefore, allowed and the action of the appellant dismissed.\nThe appellant now seeks to have the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nAs will have been noticed, the judgments submitted to us turned practically on the question whether the salary of the appellant was legally payable yearly or fortnightly.\nAn admission was made, at the trial, by the respondent in the following terms:\nThe defendant admits in open court that the contract between the parties was an annual contract for one year, tacitly renewed from year to year and was in full force and effect.\nIn a special factum filed in the trial court, the respondent stated:\nThe defendants agree with the plaintiff\u2019s (now appellant) statement that he had an original contract for one year and that it was renewed. They contend, however, that the notice of termination of between five and six weeks, given on October 21, 1932, was ample to terminate their contract on December 1, 1932. The whole case, therefore, centers around the sufficiency of the notice.\nThe above admission and the above statement were referred to by the trial judge and by the Court of King\u2019s Bench in their respective judgments; and each treated the litigation as being limited to the question of the sufficiency of the notice.\nThe contract now under discussion is called in the Quebec Civil Code a contract for the \u201clease and hire of work.\u201d It is governed by arts. 1666 & seq. contained in chapter 3rd of the general title (seventh) concerning lease and hire; the first chapter of the title dealing with general provisions, and the second chapter thereof dealing with the lease or hire of things.\nThe material articles of the third chapter having to do with the present case are:\n1667. The contract of lease or hire of personal services can only be for a limited term, or for a determinate undertaking. It may be prolonged by tacit renewal.\n1670. The rights and obligations arising from the lease or hire of personal services are subject to the rules common to contracts.\n(N.B. The balance of the article is immaterial here).\nAs a result of the admissions, we have it in this case:\n1. That the contract between the parties was originally for one year;\n2. That it was tacitly renewed from year to year;\n3. That the notice of termination was given on October 21, 1932, to terminate the contract with the appellant on December 1, 1932; and\n4. That the whole case centres around the sufficiency of the notice.\nThe consequence is, as very properly held by the Superior Court, that the present case is taken out of the application of the decision of this Court in Asbestos Corporation Ltd. v. Cook[2].\nIn that case, the whole discussion turned upon the length of a contract of lease and hire of work, the duration of which was not fixed, and the salary being stipulated at \u201c$6,000 per annum, dating from the 1st May, 1927, payable $500 a month.\u201d It was held that, according to its literal meaning, a contract of lease or hire of personal ser- vices at so much per year, or per month, is not a contract for a fixed period, but one for an indeterminate period; and that there was no provision in the Civil Code to the effect that the contract of hire of personal services whose duration has not been agreed upon will be deemed to have been made for one year when the salary has been fixed at so much per year.\nOn the precise point herein involved, Asbestos Corporation Ltd. v. Cook[3] has no application to the present litigation. There exists here no dispute with regard to the length of the original contract, since the parties agree that it was made for one year.\nThe engagement of the appellant under the terms of the contract would, therefore, have ended on the 1st of December, 1929, without there being any necessity for a notice from one side or the other.\nBut the parties agree that the contract was prolonged by tacit renewal. And although article 1667 of the Civil Code enacts that this may be done, it is absolutely silent on the terms and conditions whereby the tacit renewal is to be governed.\nContrary to what was said in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, this Court, in the Asbestos case3, did not decide that\nla tacite reconduction n\u2019avait pas eu lieu pour une autre ann\u00e9e mais plut\u00f4t pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, mais cela pour le motif que le contrat d\u2019en-gagement originaire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour un an, comme l\u2019avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019Appel, mais pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9.\nThe view expressed by us was that in the Asbestos case3 the question of tacit renewal did not arise:\nEt si le contrat \u00e9tait, comme nous le d\u00e9cidons, pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il ne pouvait \u00eatre question de tacite reconduction. En effet, comme le fait remarquer Mignault, Droit civil canadien, vol. 7, p. 371: \u201cPour qu\u2019il y ait lieu \u00e0 tacite reconduction, il faut qu\u2019il y ait un terme convenu ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 pour la dur\u00e9e du service.\u201d\nLa tacite reconduction n\u2019a lieu que si les relations des parties persistent apr\u00e9s l\u2019expiration de la date fix\u00e9e au bail de services; dans le cas d\u2019un louage pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9terminee, le cas ne saurait se pr\u00e9senter.\nThe question now submitted is, therefore, fully open in this Court. Of course, as was pointed out, both parties appear to agree that tacit renewal of a contract of lease or hire of personal services originally made for a year prolongs that contract for another year. Such is the contention put forward by the appellant in his declaration; and such is also the effect of the admission made by the respondent and already referred to: that the contract * * * was * * * tacitly renewed from year to year and was in full force and effect\nat the time when the notice was given.\nOur view of the law agrees with the admission. Might it be said at once that, on this subject, no guidance can be found in the jurisprudence of the courts of France or in the doctrine of the French writers, because the law is not the same.\nUnder what terms and conditions is the lease and hire of work prolonged by tacit renewal in the province of Quebec?\nThe words \u201ctacit renewal\u201d are employed in the Civil Code in articles 579, 1608, 1609, 1610, 1611, 1667, and nowhere else.\nIn all these articles, they are used exclusively in connection with leases. Every one of these articles is contained within the title of \u201cLease and Hire,\u201d except art, 579 dealing with emphyteutic lease and which refers to it only to provide that \u201cemphyteusis is not subject to tacit renewal.\u201d\nOtherwise, the Civil Code treats the lease or hire of personal services as coming under the subject and general provisions of lease and hire; and both contracts, that having things for its object or that having work for its object, are dealt with by the Code under the same general title (Arts. 1600 & seq. C.C.).\nIt is, therefore, strictly in conformity with the usual rules of interpretation that the same words, used in the same legislation, will, unless the context compels a different construction, be interpreted as having the same meaning.\nIt would follow that, in the minds of the codifiers and of the legislature, the words \u201ctacit renewal,\u201d in art. 1667 C.C., in connection with the lease and hire of work, must have been used for the same purpose and within the same meaning as the identical words in another chapter of the same title of the Civil Code dealing with the lease or hire of things.\nAs a matter of fact, \u201ctacit renewal,\u201d as expressed in articles 1608, 1609, 1610 and 1611 C.C., is used for the same purpose and with the same effect as in article 1667 C.C., to wit: the tacit prolongation of a contract of lease originally made for a fixed period and which is allowed by the parties to last beyond the length of time originally agreed upon.\nUnder the circumstances, our view is that the intention of the legislature and of the Civil Code in using the words \u201ctacit renewal\u201d in connection with the lease and hire of personal services, in article 1667 C.C., was that it should convey the same meaning, carry the same effect and be governed by the same rules, mutatis mutandis, as tacit renewal operating in the case of a contract for lease or hire of things.\nIn the case of things, tacit renewal operates\nif the lessee remain in possession more than eight days after the expiration of the lease, without any opposition or notice on the part of the lessor (Art. 1609 C.C.).\nIn a similar way, under article 1667 C.C., will tacit renewal operate in the case of personal services (provided, of course, they were not leased for a determinate undertaking), if the lessor continues to give his services beyond the expiration of the term originally fixed, without any opposition or notice on the part of the lessee.\nBy force of article 1609 C.C., tacit renewal of the lease of things\ntakes place for another year, or the term for which such lease was made, if less than a year.\nLikewise, tacit renewal of a lease of personal services will take place for another year, unless the term for which such lease was made is less than a year.\nBut, alike in the lease of things or real property, where \u201cthe lessee cannot thereafter (i.e., after tacit renewal) leave the premises or be ejected from them, unless notice has been given within the delay required by law\u201d (Article 1609 C.C.), in the lease of work prolonged by tacit renewal, the lessor; or servant, will not have the right thereafter to leave the service of the master, or the master will not have the right to dismiss the servant, unless notice has been given within the delay required by law.\nApplying this view of the law to the contract between the appellant and the respondent, it means that when the original lease of the personal services of the appellant (which was made for one year) was prolonged by tacit renewal, it was prolonged for another year from December 1, 1929, to December 1, 1930.\nBut it also means that, once having been prolonged beyond the term originally fixed in the contract (\u201cterme conventionnel\u201d), it was no longer a contract which, by its very terms, was to terminate at a fixed date mutually agreed upon; it became a contract which, by law, was presumed to be prolonged for another period of time fixed by the law itself, and with the proviso that it would terminate upon one or the other party giving a notice \u201cwithin the delay required by law.\u201d\nWe cannot acquiesce, therefore, to the somewhat novel suggestion made by the Court of King\u2019s Bench that a contract of lease prolonged by tacit renewal ought to be considered as a contract for a fixed period of time terminating at the expiration of that time without any notice being required from one party or the other. This new doctrine would have the effect of applying to the tacit renewal of leases of work the provision of article 1609 C.C. in part only, without the qualification that there must be a notice to put an end to a lease so renewed. We can see no reason why, if the tacit renewal provided for in article 1667 C.C. is to be assimilated to the tacit renewal in article 1609 C.C., the provisions of the latter article should not apply in full.\nWe may add that counsel for the respondent was utterly unable to find any precedent in the jurisprudence of the province of Quebec in support of such a proposition. So far as we have been able to ascertain, the decisions in the province of Quebec have consistently been in the other direction.\nMay we part with this point by referring to the following passage of Mr. Mignault, in his Droit Civil Canadien (vol. 7, p. 348), with which we completely agree:\nCe qui est abondamment clair c\u2019est que le cong\u00e9 est requis pour mettre fin \u00e0 tout bail, \u00e9crit ou verbal, dont la dur\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, ainsi qu\u2019au bail presume de l\u2019article 1608 et au bail continu\u00e9 par tacite reconduction.\nArticle 1609 C.C., by its clear terms, requires a notice to be given in order to terminate a lease which has been tacitly renewed; but the article itself does not contain any provision as to the length of the notice required to be given. In the case of lease of things, the rule invariably followed, and which in our view is the right one, is, for the requirements of the law in respect to notice, to look to article 1657 C.C. To use the words of Planiol and Ripert (vol. 11, no. 859):\nD\u2019une mani\u00e9re g\u00e9n\u00e9rate la dur\u00e9e du d\u00e9lai est en rapport avec les \u00e9poques de paiement du salaire. * * *\nWe see no difficulty in accepting this guidance equally for the delay with which a notice ought to be given in order to terminate a contract for the lease or hire of work prolonged by tacit renewal. In fact, this would seem to be in accordance with the principles of good sense; and, unless we are greatly mistaken, we think it is also in accordance with the regular practice of the courts in the province of Quebec. At least, this would appear to be the effect of the numerous cases cited to us by counsel on both sides in the present case.\nNo disapproval of that practice can be found in our judgment in Asbestos Corporation Ltd. v. Cook[4], contrary to what seemed to have been the impression of counsel for the respondent, both in his factum and in his argument.\nIt should be emphasized, as already pointed out at the beginning of this judgment, that the Asbestos case4 had nothing to do with the question of tacit renewal. Our judgment in that case was dealing with a contract of lease for an undetermined period of time.\nBut, even in a case of that character, this court decided that the contract could not be terminated without giving a notice of a reasonable delay; and that, on this point,\nParticle 1657 du Code pose une r\u00e9gie qui peut servir de guide[5].\nNow, article 1657 C.C. requires a notice of three months prior to the expiration of the contract prolonged by tacit renewal, if the rent be payable at terms of three or more months; if, however, the rent be payable at terms of less than three months, the delay is to be regulated according to article 1642; which means that if the rent be payable at terms of a month, the notice must be given with a delay of one month; if for a day, then the notice must be with a delay of one day.\nIn the Asbestos case4, we discussed the question of the application of article 1642 C.C. to a lease of personal services, and we held that it was not applicable to such a lease for the purpose of determining the length or the duration of the contract, since it was clear that the article was, by its very terms, a rule peculiar to the lease or hire of houses. There was, however, no intention of extending the principle beyond the subject-matter in discussion in that case, or, in other words, beyond the question of the length of the lease. The words of The Earl of Halsbury, L.C., in Quinn v. Leathern[6] are apposite:\nEvery judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be an exposition of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found * * * , a case is only an authority for what it actually decided.\nWe did not decide in the Asbestos case[7] that article 1642 C.C. could not be applied to leases of personal services, in so far as it is referred to in article 1657 C.C. for the purpose of computing the delay of the notice required to terminate a contract prolonged by tacit renewal. That is an entirely different question from the question in issue in that case.\nWe thought we would make the above statement so as to remove any misapprehension in that regard; but in the view we take of the present case, it is not necessary to rely on article 1642 C.C., for article 1657 C.C. is sufficient for our decision.\nThe appellant, it is true, under the terms of his contract with the respondent, was being paid a salary of $7,500 per annum. The contract itself was silent as to the time of payment of the salary. There was a question whether it was part of the contract that the salary should be paid fortnightly. The trial judge held that it was payable yearly. Under all circumstances, this would be a question of fact as to which due consideration would have to be given to the finding of the court of first instance.\nBut a point which seems to have been overlooked by the Court of King\u2019s Bench and as to which considerable argument was offered to this Court is that the salary of $7,500 per annum was not the only, nor the whole compensation which the appellant was entitled to receive under his contract. There was provision for an \u201cadditional compensation\u201d in the form of a commission of 10% based on certain specified items of income and outgo to be computed at the end of the year. The \u201crent\u201d in respect to the payment of which the delay for the giving of the notice is to be computed under article 1657 C.C. evidently, in the case of the present appellant, includes both the salary and the commission.\nEven if it should be held that the salary was payable fortnightly, it is quite clear that the commissions were payable only at the end of the year. Under the circumstances, it seems to us that it cannot be said of the appellant that the \u201crent\u201d due to him, or his salary and item-mission together were payable \u201cat terms of less than three months\u201d; and it follows that, having regard to the provisions of article 1657 C.C., and to all the circumstances, this is not a case where the lease of personal services, prolonged as it was by tacit renewal, could be terminated by a notice of less than three months.\nFor the reasons above stated, the appeal ought to be allowed; and, in the result, the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brais, L\u00e9tourneau & Campbell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laverty, Hale & Laverty.\n[1] (1935) Q.R. 59 K.B. 175.\n[2] [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n[3] [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n3 [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n3 [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n[4] [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n4 [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n[5] [1933] S.C.R. 86, at 100.\n4 [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n[6] [1901] A.C. 495, at 506.\n[7] [1933] S.C.R. 86.\n",

C., which enacts an imperative requirement (\"shall contain\"), there must be in the charge a statement that the accused has committed an indictable offence; and such offence must be \"specified.\" It will be sufficient if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must contain such statement \"in substance.\" It will not be sufficient to merely classify or characterize the offence; it is necessary to specify time, place and matter and to state the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence. The statement \"may be made in popular language, without any tech\u00adnical averments\" or allegations; or it \"may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence\"; but the statement must contain the allegations of matter \"essential to be proved\" and must be in. \"words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged\" (ss. 2 and 3 of section 852 Cr. C.) : the main object of such legislation being that an accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, indentify with reasonable precision the act or acts with which he is charged in order that he may be advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the appellants, on their trial before Belleau J. and a jury, on a charge of having been parties to a seditious conspiracy. The grounds of appeal, and the. material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, the indictment and the conviction were quashed.\nR. L. Calder K.C. and Louis Lemay for the appellants.\nG\u00e9rard Lacroix K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellants were found guilty and con\u00advicted in the province of Quebec of having been parties to a seditious conspiracy. Upon appeal, the verdict and conviction thereon were unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side).\nIn the province of Quebec (as well as in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Colum\u00adbia), it is no longer necessary to prefer a bill of indictment before a grand jury; but it is sufficient that the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged (Cr. Code, subs. 5 of sec. 873).\nIn the present case, the charge was preferred by the Attorney-General and read as follows:\nThe Attorney-General of the province of Quebec charges that: during the months of September and October in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three, at the city of Quebec, in the district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec, George H. Brodie, of Toronto, and G. C. Barrett, of Belleville, Ontario, were party to a seditious conspiracy, in conspiring together and with one W. F. Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons unknown, thereby committing the crime of seditious conspiracy.\nOne of the grounds of appeal to the Court of King's Bench was that this indictment was, on the face of it, insufficient. That court, however, refused to entertain the objection and to quash the indictment.\nThe appellants, thereupon, alleging that the judgment appealed from conflicted with the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in a like case (to wit: Rex v. Buck[1]), were granted leave to appeal to this Court under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nThere can be no question of the existence of the con\u00adflict.\nIn the present case, the whole indictment, and in the Buck case, the count objected to in the indictment, charged the accused with being parties to a seditious con\u00adspiracy. In both cases, the time and place were mentioned, the accused were named and all that was charged was that, at such time and place, the accused were \"parties to a seditious conspiracy.\" In the present case, the indictment adds:\nin conspiring together and with one W. F. Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs, A. M. Rose and also with other persons unknown. It does not appear in the report of the Buck case that the count there in issue contained a similar mention. But otherwise the form of the charge was identical. In the Quebec court of appeal, the indictment was held valid; in the Ontario Court of Appeal, the count in the indictment was held invalid. It is evident that the condition required by section 1025 of the Criminal Code is met; and, leave having been granted, an appeal lies to this Court.\nIt remains for us to decide whether or not a charge pre\u00adferred in the form stated is sufficient under the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nThe general provisions as to counts and indictments are contained in ss. 852 & seq. of the Code; and the funda\u00admental rule is laid down in s. 852 itself, which reads as follows:\n852. Every count of an indictment shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused has committed some indictable offence therein specified.\n2. Such statement may be made in popular language without any technical averments or any allegations of matter not essential to be proved.\n3. Such statement may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged.\n4. Form 64 affords examples of the manner of stating offences.\nThis section has given rise to a diversity of interpreta\u00adtions, not only in the case immediately under discussion and in the judgment of the Ontario court in Rex v. Buck[2] already adverted to, but also in other decisions through-out the country. It has been stated by one court that the requirement that a count shall state in substance that the accused has committed some indictable offence therein specified has reference to the particular kind of offence, such as distinguished from other kinds of offences recog\u00adnized by the law; that it was not directed to the specific acts and things which constitute the offence alleged to have been committed (Prendergast, J., in Rex. v. Kelly[3]); while another court (Rex v. Trainor[4]) Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta) thought it was clear the enactment did not mean that it is sufficient to say that the accused did, on such a day, \" commit theft,\" or \"steal,\" or \" did commit an assault with intent to rob,\" without specifying the thing stolen, or identifying the person assaulted, not necessarily by name, but in some way or other.\nSuch was decidedly the view of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, as expressed in its judg\u00adment in Rex v. Bainbridge[5], where Magee, J.A., said (p. 222):\nIt is evident from subsec. 2 (of sec. 852) that matter which is essential to be proved is not to be omitted, and from subsec. 3 that the accused is to have notice of the offence and not merely of the character or class of the offence; while subsec. 1 requires that there is to be a substantial statement of an offence which, not the class of which, is specified, and which must be an indictable one.\nIn the same case, elute, J. said:\nThis (subsec. 1 of sec. 852) does not mean merely naming an offence, as \"murder\" or \"theft,\" but the offence itself must be specified.\nAnd a little further:\nThe indictment must contain a valid count identifying the charge.\nThe other judges of the court agreed either with Magee, J.A., or with Clute, J.\nFollowing the same principle, the Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the Court of Appeal in the Buck case[6] and, as already mentioned, with reference to an indictment preferred in precisely the same wording as in the present case, said that the count failed for insufficiency; and the insufficiency was not cured by the furnishing of particulars showing matter which, if embodied in the count, would have rendered the count adequate. He expressed the view that the true functions of particulars was to give further information to the accused of that which it was intended to prove against him, so that he may have a fair trial; but it was not intended to be, in effect, the supple\u00admenting of a defective indictment by supplying that which ought to have appeared in the indictment itself. He added:\nThis is very plain from the reading of sec. 859 of the Code (later to be referred to).\nOn the other hand, in the judgment now appealed from, Bernier, J., thought\nqu'il suffit que l'acte d'accusation contienne en substance une d\u00e9claration que le pr\u00e9venu a commis quelque acte criminel et sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 * * * chaque chef d'accusation doit d\u00e9crire les circonstances de l'infraction imput\u00e9e, afin de permettre l'accus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre ce \u00e0 quoi il se rapporte; n\u00e9anmoins, ajoute l'article, l'absence ou l'insuffisance de ces d\u00e9tails ne vicie pas le chef d'accusation.\nHe further said, it is true:\nIl est possible que l'acte d'accusation aurait pu d\u00e9crire en d\u00e9tails la conspiration s\u00e9ditieuse reproch\u00e9e aux appelants; chose bien certain e cependant, c'est que cette omission ne leur a caus\u00e9, et n.e pouvait leur causer aucun pr\u00e9judice, aucun .substantial wrong; ils savaient parfaite-ment ce dont ils \u00e9taient accus\u00e9s et ce pourquoi ils allaient subir une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire suivie d'un proc\u00e8s.\nAnd it is not possible exactly to surmise how far the latter consideration influenced the decision of the learned judge.\nAs for Walsh, J., who spoke on behalf of the other members of the Court, he held the indictment sufficient as the appellants were \"charged in the words of the Criminal Code.\" The Crown had submitted and produced certain pamphlets distributed by the accused, expressive of the seditious intention, and although no specific passage in those pamphlets had been indicated by the Crown, this, in the learned judge's view, was not necessary in this case\nbecause no particular, but an ensemble constituted the offence.\nThe differences in the legal interpretation of sec. 852 might also be traced in, among other cases: The Queen v. Weir (No. 5)[7], Wurtele, J.; Rex. v. Lemelin[8], King's Bench (Quebec) appeal side; Le Roi v. Beauvais & Mon-tour[9]; Hatem v. Rex[10].\nIt has now become our duty to decide the question.\nIf section 852 be analysed, it will be noticed the impera\u00adtive requirement (\" shall contain \") is that there must be a statement that the accused has committed an indictable offence; and such offence must be \"specified.\" It will be sufficient if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must contain such statement \"in substance.\" In our view, this does not mean merely classifying or char\u00adacterizing the offence; it calls for the necessity of specifying time, place and matter (Compare dictum of Channel, J., in Smith v. Moody[11]), of stating the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.\nThe manner of stating the matter is of no absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3. The statement may be made in popular language, without any technical averments or allegations; or it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the latter parts of subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of Parliament: the statement must contain the allegations of matter \" essential to be proved,\" and must be in \" words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged.\" Those are the very words of the section; and they were put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable pre\u00adcision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.\nWhat Parliament intended by using the words \"a statement * * * (of) some indictable offence therein speci\u00adfied,\" in subsection 1 of section 852 is, to our mind, clearly illustrated by the \"examples of the manner of stating offences\" given in Form 64, referred to in subsection 4 of section 852.\nUnder the Interpretation Act (Ch. 1 of R.S.C., 1927), by force of sec. 31 (d):\nwherever forms are prescribed, slight deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead, shall not invalidate them;\nwhich obviously means that any substantial deviation might be sufficient to invalidate the form used. Now, a perusal of the examples given in Form 64 will be sufficient to indicate that in no case is the manner of stating offences limited to the mere naming of them, but in each case the act charged against the accused, though described in the words of the enactment, is identified by specifying the time, the place and the matter. We think the examples in Form 64 are referred to for the purpose of indicating that they ought to be followed in substance. It is not sufficient in a count to charge an indictable offence in the abstract. Con\u00adcrete facts of a nature to identify the particular act which is charged and to give the accused notice of it are necessary ingredients of the indictment. An accused person may not be charged merely of having committed murder; the statement must specify the matter. In the same way, in the present case, the appellants could not be charged merely with having been \"parties to a seditious conspiracy,\" or having \"committed the crime of seditious conspiracy.\" The particular agreement between each of them and \" with one W. F. Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons unknown\" into which they are alleged to have entered and to which the Attorney-General gave the appellation of \" seditious conspiracy \" ought to have been specified in the charge prepared, either in popular language or in the words of the code, in such a way as to show on its face that \" the matter charged \" (subsection 2 of sec. 852) was an indict-able offence and as to apprise the accused of the acts com\u00admitted by them for which they were called upon to answer.\nAs a matter of fact, this requirement of an indictment is further embodied in sec. 853 of the Criminal Code, which enacts that\nEvery count * * * shall contain so much detail of the circum\u00adstances of the alleged offence as is sufficient to give to the accused reason-able information as to the act or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred to.\nSuch is the rule of the Criminal Code.\nOf course, it is qualified by the proviso\nthat the absence or insufficiency of such details shall not vitiate the count,\nand it must be granted that these words are very strong. It should be noticed, however, that the proviso, as well as the section itself, relates only to the \"absence or insuffi\u00adciency of details.\" It does not detract from the obligation resulting from sec. 852 that the substance of the offence should be stated in the indictment.\nAgain do we find in sec. 855 the confirmation of the construction which must be put on sec. 852, in accordance with the views now expressed by us.\nSec. 855 is an enumeration of instances where, notwith\u00adstanding the omission of certain statements, the law says that\nno count shall be deemed objectionable or insufficient for the reason only\nof this omission. A mere perusal of the instances there given will show conclusively, to our mind, that the require\u00adments of sec. 852 with regard to the ingredients which \" every count of an indictment shall contain \" may not be restricted to the mere naming of the offence charged, with-out specifying the substance of the particular act com\u00adplained of. If sec. 852 were to be construed in accordance with the contentions of the Crown in the present case, the enumeration in sec. 855 of special exceptions wherein cer\u00adtain omissions are not to be deemed objectionable, or to render the counts insufficient, would have been quite unnecessary.\nPerhaps, in the premises, it should be added that the Crown was unable to bring the indictment within any of the enumerated exceptions, which makes it still clearer that the indictment under discussion is insufficient. For example: Subsection (d) of sec. 855 enacts that no count shall be deemed objectionable for the reason\nthat it does not set out any document which may be the subject of the charge.\nIn our view, this assumes that a document made the sub\u00adject of a charge should be referred to in the count, but that it will not be necessary to \" set out \" the document itself. In the present case, although apparently the Attorney-General intended to charge against the accused the distribution of certain pamphlets, no reference in the indictment is made to these pamphlets, or, indeed, to any pamphlet at all. A fortiori, was there no \"setting out,\" in whole or in part, of the pamphlets in question; although the omission to \" set out \" the document is alone stated as being the omission which shall not be deemed objection-able or shall not render the count insufficient.\nThe same reasoning may be made in respect to sub-section (e) of sec. 855, that the count\ndoes not set out the words used where words are the subject of the charge.\nUnder subsections (f) and (g), a count is not insufficient for the reason\nthat it does not specify the means by which the offence was com\u00admitted,\nor\nthat it does not name or describe with precision any person, place or thing.\nIt seems to us that the very terms in which the exceptions are expressed underline the minimum of ingredients which a valid count of an indictment should contain. It must contain, in substance, a statement of the specific act which is charged, although it is not necessary that it should \"specify the means\" by which the act was committed, or that it, should name, or describe, \"with precision\" any person, place or thing. In the latter provision, the essen\u00adtial words are the words: \"with precision.\"\nThat this is the correct interpretation of sec. 855 is strengthened, in our view, by comparison with sec. 859 enumerating the cases in which particulars may be ordered.\nSubsection (d) of sec. 859 deals with the charge of sell\u00ading, or exhibiting, an obscene book, pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing. If the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair trial, it may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars stating what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper or other printing or writing are relied on in support of the charge. Which presupposes that the book, pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing has already been referred to in the charge.\nThis is made still clearer in subsections (e), (f) and (g) relating to \" any document or words the subject of a charge\"; to \"means by which any offence was com\u00admitted\"; or to \" any person, place or thing referred to in any indictment.\" Each of these subsections begins by the words: \" further describing,\" which obviously contemplates indictments already describing the document or words the subject of a charge, the means by which any offence was committed, but requiring a \"further \" description which, in the view of the Court, \" is necessary for a fair trial.\"\nAs for the \"person, place or thing\" dealt with in sub-section (g), the point is made doubly clear, since the sub-section speaks of a \"person, place or thing (already) re\u00adferred to in any indictment\"; and it is stated that a particular may be ordered \"further describing\" them.\nThe evident relation between the matters dealt with in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of sec. 855 and the corre\u00adsponding subsections of sec. 859 is, we think, illuminating on the subject-matter of the present discussion. Clearly the result flowing from the two sections read together is: that some statement of the particular circumstances of the offence charged is assumed to be already contained in the count; that there may be omissions which, on account of sec. 855, are not sufficient to make the count objectionable; that the count will not be deemed insufficient by reason only of those omissions; and that if the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair trial, it may order particulars to describe further, or with more precision the matters in question. It need not be added that we are speaking now of counts in general, without reference to special cases such as are: libel, perjury, false pretence, or other cases which are the objects of special provisions with regard to indictment in the Criminal Code.\nApplying the above principles to the present appeal, it follows that the indictment must be found insufficient. It is not the case where an offence is imperfectly stated; it is a case where essential averments were wholly omitted. The so-called indictment contains defects in matters of substance. To use the apt words of counsel for the appel\u00adlants: \u201cit does not describe the offence in such a way as to lift it from the general to the particular.\"\nOf course, we are dealing with a case of conspiracy; and we are not unaware of the fact that in stating the object of the conspiracy the same certainty may not be required as in an indictment for the offence conspired to be com\u00admitted (Archbold's Criminal Pleading, 29th ed., at p. 1419).\nOn a charge of conspiracy, the agreement is itself the gist of the offence (Paradis v. The King[12]). The mere agreement to commit the crime is regarded by the law sufficient to render the parties to it guilty at once of a crime (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th ed., p. 81).\nAnd we need only recall the often cited passage of Lord Chelmsford in Mulcahy v. The Queen[13]:\nIt cannot exist without the consent of two or more persons; and their agreement is an act in advancement of the intention which each of them has conceived in his mind.\nIn other words, to borrow the expression of Mr. Justice Willes (Mulcahy v. The Queen at p. 317): \"The very plot is an act in itself.\" It follows that a person may be convicted of conspiracy as soon as it has been formed and before any overt act has been committed. The offence is complete as soon as the parties have agreed as to their unlawful purpose (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th ed., p. 289; Belyea v. The King[14]). Hence the overt acts need not be set out in the indictment (Archbold's Crim\u00adinal Pleading, 29th ed., p. 1420. The King v. Hutchin\u00adson[15]). The conspiracy is the offence. It is not necessary to show that the accused went on to commit some overt act towards carrying out the conspiracy. The actual accom\u00adplishment of the crime agreed upon will not cause the original offence of conspiracy to become merged in it (Kenny, pp. 289 and 290).\nBut although conspiracy to commit a crime, being in itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone in an indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it does not follow that the count charging con\u00adspiracy alone, without the setting out of any overt act, must not describe it in such a way as to contain in sub-stance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is charged, or, in other words, in such a way as to specify, in substance, the specific transaction intended to be brought against the accused.\nThese averments were omitted and these necessary in\u00adgredients were lacking in the indictment preferred against the appellants. Their absence constitutes defects in matters of substance; and we are of opinion that these defects were not cured by the so-called incomplete particulars verbally given by the Crown when, at the outset of the trial, objection was taken to the indictment by counsel for the accused. The Crown, it may be added, in the argu\u00adment before us did not rely on these particulars, and took the stand that the indictment was sufficient as it stood. Nor can we accede to the argument that, in the circum\u00adstances, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and that we should exercise the powers given to us by sec. 1014 of the Criminal Code. In our view, it was a substantial wrong towards the appellants to have compelled them to plead to an illegal indictment.\nThe motion to quash the indictment made by the accused at the beginning of the trial, and before pleading, ought to have been granted. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed. The indictment and the conviction must be quashed, the Crown being at liberty to prefer a fresh indictment, if so advised.\nWe do not want to part with this appeal, however, with-out saying that our decision is strictly limited to the points in issue. We would not like to be taken as subscribing to certain generalities contained in some of the judgments to which we have been referred and which would tend to convey the idea that, notwithstanding the coming into force of the Criminal Code, the criminal law in this country should continue to be administered as though there were no Code.\nAppeal allowed; conviction quashed.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] (1932) 57 Can.

When the assembling was completed an engine was attached and the train was hauled westerly to connecting tracks within defendant\u2019s yards. Children played in the vicinity. One evening, after a long train had been assembled, and the hauling crew had taken charge, and were about to start the train, the plaintiff, a boy aged 4\u00bd years, ran across the street, unnoticed by the trainmen, climbed the end side ladder of a car, crossed to the rear ladder, and fell at the jerk of the starting train and was injured by the moving train. Defendant was sued for damages.\nHeld (Crocket J. dissenting): Defendant was not liable. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 43 Man. R. 345, reversed).\nPer Duff C.J. and Rinfret J.: Plaintiff was a trespasser on the train and on that ground alone was precluded from maintaining a right of action for negligence. The case is governed by Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Barnett, [1911] A.C. 361. (Lygo v. Newbold, 9 Ex. 302, Hughes v. Macfie, 2 H. & C. 744, and Addie v. Dumbreck, [1929] A.C. 358, also cited). Further, no breach of duty by defendant had been established. Towards people using the public street defendant was bound to exercise reasonable care. Engaged in the execution of statutory powers, it was bound to take reasonable care not to cause unnecessary harm to those who might be injured by a careless or unreasonable exercise of its rights. But it was under no obligation to intending trespassers, children or adults, to prevent them effectuating a trespass upon its cars. Its duty towards such a trespasser was limited to refraining from intentionally injuring him or \u201cnot to do a wilful act in disregard of ordinary humanity towards him\u201d; \u201cnot to act with reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser.\u201d On the evidence it was clear that defendant did not permit children to climb on the cars and tried to prevent them; it was not in the position of a tacit licensor. There was here no nuisance; the action rested upon negligence; (the distinction, and its importance, discussed, and Lynch v. Nurdin, 1 Q.B. 29, Liddle v. Yorkshire, [1934] 2 K.B. 101, Cooke v. Midland, [1908] 2 Ir. R. 242, [1909] A.C. 229, Latham v. Johnson [1913] 1 K.B. 398, discussed). The present case has no analogy to Lynch v. Nurdin, 1 Q.B. 29, Glascow Corporation v. Taylor, [1922] 1 A.C. 44, Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan, [1930] A.C. 404, or Cooke v. Midland, [1909] A.C. 229. A person who is using his vehicle in the usual way, having committed no wrong, and though the vehicle may be attractive to children, is guilty of neither negligence nor nuisance, and is not responsible for injury to children caused by their trespassing thereon.\nPer Davis J.: The case cannot be treated in law as one of nuisance, and falls to be determined upon the question of negligence. That distinction is fundamental. The presence and movement of cars on the street was the inevitable result of the ordinary exercise of defendant\u2019s public authority. It was not shewn that plaintiff was on the car with leave or licence of defendant. He was a trespasser on the car. It was clear upon the evidence that no employee of defendant saw him approaching the car or upon it. It could not be fairly said upon the evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct toward him was such wilful or reckless disregard of his presence as to amount to malicious conduct toward him. To hold defendant liable would make it virtually an insurer of a trespasser. (Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Barnett, [1911] A.C. 361, Addie v. Dumbreck, [1929] A.C. 358, and Liddle v. Yorkshire, [1934] 2 K.B. 101, cited. Lynch v. Nurdin, 1 Q.B. 29, Cooke v. Midland, [1909] A.C. 229, Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan, [1930] A.C. 404, and other cases, discussed).\nPer Kerwin J.: Defendant\u2019s railway track was legally on the street, and its employees were lawfully engaged in moving the cars. Defendant owed no duty to plaintiff which it failed to fulfil. Plaintiff\u2019s act in running out and getting on the car when none of defendant\u2019s employees happened to be looking, was something against which defendant could not guard, and which, in law, it was not incumbent upon it to foresee. (Donovan v. Union Cartage Co., [1933] 2 K.B. 71, Liddle v. Yorkshire, [1934] 2 K.B. 101, and other cases, referred to).\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): Defendant, in the exercise of its right to assemble cars and move trains on its track along the street, was bound to take such precautions for avoidance of injury to the public as were fairly commensurate with the danger created by said operations. Its degree of care and vigilance owed to the public depended on existing conditions and risks, as they were known or ought to have been known to defendant or its servants in charge. At the particular point where the accident happened there was a special danger from the presence of children in play in close proximity, and upon the evidence defendant through its servants and agents must be charged with knowledge thereof. The standing cars were an attraction to younger children, and this should have been known to defendant\u2019s servants; and defendant did not take reasonably adequate precautions to guard against the obvious danger of such a thing as happened. It should have kept one or two watchmen to patrol the dangerous sections, specially charged with looking out for children, from the time the hauling crew took over the train until it was moved off the street. In the circumstances defendant could not avail itself of the fact that plaintiff was a trespasser on the car; he was no more so than were the infant plaintiffs in Lynch v. Nurdin, 1 Q.B. 29, and Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan, [1930] A.C. 404.\nAPPEAL by the defendant railway company from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] allowing (Dennistoun and Trueman JJ.A. dissenting) the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Adamson J.[2] dismissing the action. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of Adamson J. and gave judgment for the infant plaintiff for $5,000 and for the adult plaintiff (the mother of the infant plaintiff) for $800. The action was brought to recover damages by reason of injury to the infant plaintiff caused when, having climbed on a ear of defendant\u2019s freight train which had been assembled on defendant\u2019s track on Higgins Avenue in the city of Winnipeg, he was jerked off by the starting train and run over. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was, as against the infant plaintiff, allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge restored, Crocket J. dissenting. The appeal as against the adult plaintiff was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, no order granting special leave to appeal having been obtained.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and L. J. Reycraft K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. T. Thorson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The infant respondent, it would appear, was a trespasser on the appellant\u2019s train, and on that ground alone would seem to be precluded from maintaining a right of action for negligence. The case is governed by Barnett\u2019s case[3]. No pertinent distinction can, I think, be drawn between a train which is momentarily upon a part of the railway that traverses a public street and a train which, at the time of the injury, is on a part of the company\u2019s line where the title to and possession of the soil are vested in the railway company. Indeed, in Lygo v. Newbold[4], a person who was riding in the defendant\u2019s wagon on a public road in such circumstances as to constitute him a trespasser was held to be precluded by virtue of that fact from recovering damages from the owner for injuries resulting from the negligence of the owner\u2019s servant who was driving the wagon. This case is cited with approval in the judgment of the Privy Council in Barnett\u2019s case3. The principle of Lygo v. Newbold4 was applied in Hughes v. Macfie[5]. The judgments of Lord Hailsham and Lord Dunedin in Addie v. Dumbreck[6] establish that for this purpose no distinction can be drawn between adults and infants.\nLynch v. Nurdin[7] is said to establish such a distinction. It is convenient to discuss that case later.\nBut the respondent also fails because no breach of duty by the appellants has been established. Towards people using the public street the appellants are bound to exercise reasonable care. They are engaged in the execution of statutory powers and are, therefore, under an obligation to take reasonable care not to cause unnecessary harm to those who may be injured by a careless or unreasonable exercise of their rights. But they are under no obligation to intending trespassers to prevent them effectuating a trespass upon their cars, which are a part of the railway; whether they be children or adults. If they permit children to climb upon their cars they may find themselves in the position of tacit licensors and, in consequence, affected by duties towards them as licensees; but nobody suggests (such a suggestion is negatived by the evidence) that the respondent was a licensee.\nThe duty of the appellants towards a trespasser on one of their trains, as explained in Barnett\u2019s case[8], is limited to refraining from intentionally injuring him, or what is virtually the same thing, \u201cnot to do a wilful act in disregard of ordinary humanity towards him.\u201d The distinction between cases of nuisance and cases of negligence where the plaintiff is a trespasser is illustrated in Liddle v. Yorkshire[9].\nThree lines of argument founded upon three separate decisions are presented in support of the judgment. Before dealing with these decisions, two observations would appear to be pertinent. First, as a general rule, it is not a legitimate use of a judgment to separate particular expressions from their context and, without regard to the point at issue or the facts of the case, to treat those expressions as governing the decision in other cases. Second, we must be careful, as Farwell L.J. said in Latham v. Johnson[10],\nnot to allow our sympathy with the infant plaintiff to affect our judgment: sentiment is a dangerous will-of-the-wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles.\nThe first of these decisions is Lynch v. Nurdin[11]. There has been some difference of opinion upon the question whether the ground of liability in Lynch v. Nurdin11 was nuisance or negligence. Notwithstanding the observations of Lord Macnaghten in Cooke v. Midland[12], I can not escape the conclusion that the view expressed by Lord Sumner (then Hamilton L.J.) in Latham v. Johnson[13], by Farwell L.J. in the same case, and by Greer L.J. in Liddle v. Yorkshire9, correctly gives the effect of that case. Lord Sumner says:\nIt is necessary to distinguish all these cases which turn upon negligence from those which turn on nuisance upon or adjoining a highway. Such cases, so far as they relate to children, may in that particular be to some extent in point, but the differences between cases of nuisance and cases of negligence must never be lost sight of. The cases of Lynch v. Nurdin11; Jewson v. Gatti[14]; Harrold v. Watney[15], and Barker v. Herbert[16] are all of this class (see especially per Vaughan Williams L.J. in the last cited case at pp. 637 and 638).\nWith this view Farwell L.J. agreed, at page 403. He said:\nNo question therefore arises of the duty not to do anything that maybe a nuisance close to or upon a highway, such as arose in Jewson v. Gatti14, Harrold v. Watney15, or in Lynch v. Nurdin11, which, with all respect to Lord Macnaghten\u2019s contrary opinion in Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland[17], was clearly a case of nuisance. The horse and cart left unattended in the highway, to use the language of Vaughan Williams L.J.[18], \u201cconstituted a danger to those using the highway\u2014that is, it constituted a nuisance.\u201d\nGreer L.J. in Liddle v. Yorkshire[19] approved the pronouncements of these eminent judges. He said:\nThat was a case of nuisance, and the question involved in the case was whether the damage to the infant plaintiff could rightly be said to have been caused by the wrongful act of the defendant. As the act of the infant plaintiff in getting into the cart and the act of the other child who set it in motion were acts which any one would expect to follow as a probable result of the defendants\u2019 wrongful act, the defendants were held liable. The story began with a wrongful act by the defendant. Here there was no wrongful act by the defendants unless it be a wrongful act not to prevent children from trespassing. We have the high authority of Lord Sumner, then Hamilton L.J., in Latham v. Johnson[20] for this explanation of Lynch v. Nurdin[21]. * * *\nThe discussion in the judgments in Liddle v. Yorkshire[22] illustrates the importance of the distinction between actions founded on negligence and actions founded on nuisance as regards the fact of the plaintiff being a trespasser.\nThen, in Cooke v. Midland[23], the Lord Chancellor of Ireland explains Lynch v. Nurdin21 as a case of nuisance. So also does Holmes L.J. at p. 284. FitzGibbon L.J. does not use the term nuisance but employs these words:\nLynch v. Nurdin21 was the case of injury on a public highway, where a man left his horse and cart unattended in the street, and a probable danger resulted in actual injury.\nThe question of causal relation between the wrongful act of leaving the horse and cart unattended in a public highway and the injury to the plaintiff was, of course, a question of importance in Lynch v. Nurdin21. I am inclined to think that it is to this matter of causal relation that the observation usually quoted from Lord Denman\u2019s judgment is addressed. Lord Denman said:\nFor if I am guilty of negligence in leaving any thing dangerous in a place where I know it to be extremely probable that some other person will unjustifiably set it in motion to the injury of a third, and if that injury should be so brought about, I presume that the sufferer might have redress by action against both or either of the two, but unquestionably against the first[24].\nThis sentence taken by itself would require considerable qualification, but the succeeding sentence shews what was in the mind of the Lord Chief Justice. He said: If, for example, a gamekeeper, returning from his daily exercise, should rear his loaded gun against a wall in the playground of school boys whom he knew to be in the habit of pointing toys in the shape of guns at one another, and one of these should playfully fire it off at a school-fellow and maim him, I think it will not be doubted that the gamekeeper must answer in damages to the wounded party.\nThe true doctrine as regards causal relation is stated with accuracy, if I may say so, by Hamilton L.J., in his judgment in Latham v. Johnson (supra, at p. 413), in these words:\nChildren acting in the wantonness of infancy and adults acting on the impulse of personal peril may be and often are only links in a chain of causation extending from such initial negligence to the subsequent injury. No doubt each intervener is a causa sine qua non, but unless the intervention is a fresh, independent cause, the person guilty of the original negligence will still be the effective cause, if he ought reasonably to have anticipated such interventions and to have foreseen that if they occurred the result would be that his negligence would lead to mischief. Such cases are collected and elaborately discussed in Sullivan v. Creed[25]. The following are instances: Dixon v. Bell[26]; Illidge v. Goodwin[27]; Lynch v. Nurdin[28]; Clark v. Chambers[29]; Englehard v. Farrant & Co.[30]; McDowall v. Great Western Railway[31]; Williams v. Eady[32].\nThe sentence in the judgment in Lynch v. Nurdin[33] following the passage I have quoted above seems to support the conclusion that nuisance was within the contemplation of that judgment. Lord Denman says,\nThis might possibly be assumed as clear in principle; but there is also the authority of the present Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in its support; Illidge v. Goodwin 27.\nThe decision of Tindal C.J. to which the Lord Chief Justice refers is expressed in these words:\n* * * If a man chooses to leave a cart standing in the street, he must take the risk of any mischief that may be done;[34].\nwhich seems clearly enough to point to nuisance.\nIn this view, Lynch v. Nurdin28 could have no application to the present case. There was here no nuisance; the action rests upon negligence and the appellants owed no duty to a trespasser beyond that stated above.\nThen, one asks oneself whether there is any analogy between a railway train, to which an engine is attached, guarded by its train crew, and a horse and cart left wholly unguarded in a public street. The horse and cart was not only likely to attract children, it was calculated to entice them to interfere with it, to set it in motion. The only way a child can interfere with a railway train is by attempting to get on it. In the judgment already referred to, Hamilton L.J. considers the elements of attractiveness and of danger as envisaged by the general rule,\nthat a person who, in neglect of ordinary care, places or leaves his property in a condition which may be dangerous to another may be answerable for the resulting injury, even though but for the intervening act of a third person or of the plaintiff himself (Bird v. Holbrook[35]; Lynch v. Nurdin[36]), that injury would not have occurred.\nAt p. 419, he says:\nOne asks what kind of chattel it is in respect of which its owner owes a duty of care towards strangers, equally whether it is in a public place or on his own premises, and equally whether the strangers are invited or only licensed. There is only one answer: the chattel must be something highly dangerous in itself, inherently or from the state in which its owner suffers it to be. Danger is relative. What property must the chattel possess to make the consideration of its attractiveness to children relevant? It must be something which, from its nature or state, will draw children to it and induce them heedlessly to put it into operation.\nI cannot in any intelligible way apply this language to the appellant\u2019s train. Hamilton L.J. is speaking of property which, in neglect of ordinary care, is placed or left in a \u201ccondition which may be dangerous to another\u201d; and is something which, by reason of being left unguarded, will not only attract children to it, but will induce them heedlessly to put it into operation or tamper or play with it.\nHamilton L.J., at page 415 in the same judgment, discusses the phrases \u201ctrap,\u201d \u201cattraction\u201d and \u201callurement.\u201d A trap, he says,\ninvolves the idea of concealment and surprise of an appearance of safety under circumstances cloaking a reality of danger.\nLynch v. Nurdin36 has never been applied, so far as I am aware, to a vehicle actually in use and guarded in the normal way. It is well known that all boys experience the pressure of the invitation to climb on the back of a vehicle in order to get a ride. It has never been held, so far as I know, that a farmer driving hay to market must have somebody on top of the load to keep an eye on boys who may, and almost certainly will, indulge their propensities by getting on the back of the vehicle. In Lygo v. Newbold[37] Alderson B. appears to have rejected the idea that liability could arise in such circumstances if the child were injured through negligent driving. Indeed, he puts this possibility as a reductio ad absurdum.\nSo long as a person is actually using his vehicle in the ordinary and accustomed way, he is, it would appear, entitled to the enjoyment of it without the curtailment of his rights by trespasses or encoachments of anyone. The fact that the vehicle may present an irresistible allurement to children in the street can make no difference. There is neither negligence nor nuisance in making use in the ordinary way of a vehicle presenting attractions of such a character to infants. If, unfortunately, children of an age too tender to possess the capacity to take care of themselves put themselves in a position of danger by getting into it without the consent of the persons in charge of the vehicle, and without their knowledge, then there arises just one of those risks to which such children, when left unguarded, will unhappily be subject. The person who is making use of a vehicle he employs in the usual way, having committed no wrong, is not chargeable with responsibility for them.\nIt was considered in the Court of Appeal that Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor[38] governs this case. There, a shrub with poisonous berries was growing in the Botanical Gardens in Glasgow; and a child ate some of the berries and died in consequence. The Corporation was held responsible.\nThe question was raised by way of demurrer. Lord Buckmaster, in his judgment at pp. 49-50, sums up thus the averments in the pursuer\u2019s condescendence:\nOn a small piece of fenced ground in the gardens the appellants grew, among other botanical specimens, a shrub known as Atropa Belladonna, whose berries present a very alluring and tempting appearance to children. Notwithstanding the fence the piece of ground on which this shrub grew was open to the public. There was no isolation of the shrub nor warning that could be seen of its dangerous character. The spot where it grew was frequented by children, and according to the pursuer\u2019s allegations the circumstances were such that the defenders knew that it was probable, and indeed practically certain, that children would be tempted and deceived by the appearance of the shrub and would eat the berries. The knowledge that these berries were poisonous was also said to be possessed by the defenders. The pursuer\u2019s child, a little boy of seven, ate some of these berries and, in consequence, died.\nAll the judgments proceeded upon the circumstance that, according to the allegations, within reach of the children who, in pursuance of undoubted legal right habitually frequented the place, there had been put something which they were tempted to eat, while to eat was the certain prelude to sickness, and the probable precursor of death; as well as the facts that, though this danger was well known to the Corporation, no warning was given to parents or those having the custody of the children, and that these had no knowledge of the danger. The allegation that the defenders knew it was probable, and, indeed, practically certain, that the children would be tempted and deceived by the appearance of the shrub and would eat the berries would seem to put the matter beyond all question, and that is the basis of the decision. Lord Shaw says (at p. 62):\nI do not find myself able to draw a distinction in law between natural objects such as shrubs whose attractive fruitage may be injuriously or fatally poisonous, and artificial objects such as machines left in a public place unattended and liable to produce danger if tampered with.\nThe case plainly falls within the general rule stated in the judgment of Hamilton L.J., as quoted above (of which Bird v. Holbrook[39], is given as an instance), and all the elements mentioned in that judgment as constituting danger, attraction and trap were present. It is important to observe that the Lords who took part in Taylor\u2019s case[40] unanimously stated, either in explicit words or impliedly, that the decision has nothing whatever to do with cases where the peril is not concealed. Lord Buckmaster emphasizes \u201cthe element of mistake and deception\u201d (p. 51). At page 53, Lord Atkinson says:\nThe defenders were, therefore, aware of the existence of a concealed or disguised danger to which the child might be exposed when he frequented their park, a danger of which he was entirely ignorant, and could not by himself reasonably discover, yet they did nothing to protect him from that danger or even inform him of its existence.\nLord Shaw says, at pages 60 and 61:\nIn grounds open to the public as of right, the duty resting upon the proprietors, or statutory guardians like a municipality, of making them reasonably safe does not include an obligation of protection against dangers which are themselves obvious. Dangers, however, which are not seen and obvious should be made the subject either of effectively restricted access or of such express and actual warning of prohibition as reaches the mind of the persons prohibited. And again,\nWhere the dangers are not familiar and obvious, and where in particular they are or ought to be known to the municipality or owner, special considerations arise. In the case of objects, whether artificial, and so to speak, dangerous in themselves, such as loaded guns or explosives, or natural objects, such as trees bearing poisonous fruits which are attractive in appearance, it cannot be considered a reasonably safe procedure for a municipality or owner to permit the exhibition of these things with their dangerous possibilities in a place of recreation and without any special and particular watch and warning.\nHe adds:\nWhen the danger is familiar and obvious, no special responsibility attaches to the municipality or owner in respect of an accident having occurred to children of tender years. The reason of that appears to me to be this, that the municipality or owner is entitled to take into account that reasonable parents will not permit their children to be sent into the midst of familiar and obvious dangers except under protection or guardianship. The parent or guardian of the child must act reasonably; the municipality or guardian of the park must act reasonably. This duty rests upon both and each; but each is entitled to assume it of the other.\nFurthermore, the analogy of the case to that of an unguarded machine left in a place frequented by children and possessing, by reason of its unguarded state and other circumstances, all the elements of allurement and trap, as explained by Hamilton L.J., seems to exclude its application to the facts now under examination. If it be said that the child in plucking the berries was guilty of trespass, then the answer is that the averments, as summarized by Lord Buckmaster, would seem to bring the defenders within the rule that the land owner is under a duty even towards a trespasser \u201cnot to do a wilful act in disregard of ordinary humanity towards him.\u201d\nI now come to Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan[41]. Before considering the application of that case to the facts before us, it will be convenient to state those facts with some particularity.\nIn Winnipeg, a street named Higgins street runs along the southern boundary of part of the freight yards of the appellants. The street is 66 feet wide and in the northerly strip of 14 feet there runs a railway track, part of the appellants\u2019 railway, and, admittedly, lawfully there for the railway purposes of the appellants. This track connects at its westerly end with other tracks within the freight yards and extends between 2,500 and 3,000 feet along Higgins street, and is known as the \u201cK\u201d lead. There are freight sheds in the freight yards along the northern boundary of Higgins street.\nIt is a practice of the appellants every day in the evening to assemble a drag or train of freight cars on \u201cK\u201d lead. That is done by a group of men known as the shed crew who bring, first, a \u201ccut\u201d of cars, as the phrase is, to the west end of the lead and then, moving from the west, to add successive cuts until the whole drag is assembled. The drag in the present case included 55 cars and was something over 2,000 feet long. As each successive cut is added, the cars of the preceding cuts are necessarily pushed easterly along the lead. The car at the east end is known as the \u201cpoint\u201d car.\nFor the safety of people using the street, the appellants employed a man, Messier, whose primary duty it was to protect the \u201cpoint,\u201d in the language of the witnesses, which means that it was his duty to see that the car at the eastern end did not come into contact with any obstruction in the street and that people using the street should be warned of its approach. It was also his duty to protect the cars against intruders and, as children played on the street in the immediate vicinity and had a playground on the corner of Higgins street and another street, Ellen, entering Higgins street from the south, it was his business to see that children were kept away from the cars. His duty came to an end when the drag was assembled, as the learned trial judge has found, and, no doubt, rightly found. When the drag is assembled, also, the duties of the shed crew come to an end. It is then taken over by a hauling crew. An engine is attached and it is moved away into yards on the west.\nUnfortunately, the respondent, who was only four and a half years of age at the time, had climbed the iron ladder which, as usual, was attached to the side of one of the cars in the drag and at its end, and had succeeded in crossing to the ladder attached to the rear of the car adjacent to that attached to the side, just before the hauling crew, pursuant to their duty, started the train on its westerly movement; and, when the train started, he fell from his place on the ladder to the track below and had his leg severed from his body by one of the moving wheels.\nThe procedure in starting the train seems to be something like this: The engine is started on a movement towards the west, and then, if the driver is apprized, by signal originating with the trainman stationed near the easterly end of the train, that all the couplings are working, he proceeds with hauling the train west. The boy\u2019s fall seems to have been occasioned either by the first jerk or by that combined with the movement of the train an instant later.\nThe hauling crew consisted of the locomotive driver and fireman (with whom we are not concerned), the train foreman Wilkinson, two trainmen, Boardman and Smith. There was also a railway constable, Crick.\nWilkinson gave this account of his movements. He said that he and his two trainmen, Boardman and Smith, came to the west end of the drag before the assembling of the drag was quite complete; that he and Boardman walked to the east end of the train, then turned and walked west again. He left Boardman at a place about twelve or fifteen cars west of the east end, and proceeded to the west end of the drag where the other trainman, Smith, was stationed. It was Boardman\u2019s duty to see that, on the initiation of the movement of the train, the cars were all \u201cpulling,\u201d and, if so, to signal to Wilkinson at the west end of the train. Boardman gave the signal from a position approximately fifteen cars west of the east end of the train, and the train moved on. Boardman, still looking towards the west end of the train, climbed on top of the train, as did Wilkinson and Smith.\nCrick, the constable, says that it was his duty to check the seals on the cars and at the same time to keep watch to see that there was nobody around the train. He started at the east end of the train and walked along the northern side examining the seals and then again walked from the west end to the east end. Neither Wilkinson, nor Board-man, nor Crick saw any children near the train, although there were children playing on the southern side of Higgins street. At the time the respondent climbed the ladder, Boardman apparently was between 150 and 200 feet to the west of him with his face turned to the west. Crick, apparently, was at the car at the east end with his face turned towards the east. As to the actions of the respondent, there seems to be little doubt. The learned trial judge has accepted the story of a boy, Voss, who was eleven years of age at the time of the accident. Voss was lying on the east side of Ellen street about, as the learned judge says, 150 feet from the train. He saw the respondent rush past him, run to the car, climb the ladder just before the train started. The learned trial judge says this must have occurred just as Boardman was giving the signal. It was either just as he gave the signal or just before, when Boardman\u2019s face, as the learned judge says, was turned to the west. The boy\u2019s statement, as the learned trial judge interpreted it, virtually coincides with this. The learned trial judge, referring to the boy\u2019s movements and to the fact that he escaped the attention of the train men, says it \u201cwould all happen in a few seconds.\u201d\nMr. Thorson, who presented a very able argument on behalf of the respondent, contended most earnestly that there was evidence from which it ought to be concluded that this child had been playing near the train just before he started to climb the ladder. That view cannot be reconciled with the account given by Voss (who was a witness for the plaintiff, and whose account of what occurred was put forward by the plaintiff in Voss\u2019s evidence in chief), which, as I have said, was accepted by the learned trial judge.\nAnother boy named Hobson, who was riding about on his bicycle, gives some evidence upon which Mr. Thorson relied. Unfortunately, the effect of Hobson\u2019s evidence is rather obscure. He said in examination in chief that he had seen the little boy playing \u201caround the cars.\u201d In cross-examination he said he saw him playing where the tracks switch off into the platform. This platform is on the south side of Higgins street where a spur from \u201cK\u201d lead crosses that street. He says the boy was not playing on the platform but near there, and he adds that he was not in Ellen street at all.\nNow, Hobson\u2019s story as to his own movements is this. He saw the little boy, as he says, playing near the platform, which is about sixty or seventy feet from Ellen street. Just then he turned his bicycle west and rode on down Ellen street, not quite as far as Henry street which is distant from Higgins street about 180 feet, then he turned around and proceded towards Higgins street, and, when he was about half way between Henry and Higgins, he noticed the boy \u201changing on to\u201d the ladder on the end of the car. It is quite evident that Hobson\u2019s story cannot be reconciled with that of Voss. According to Hobson, the boy was never on Ellen street. And it is quite clear that, accepting Hobson\u2019s account of his own movements, a very short time indeed must have elapsed between the time he left the respondent playing near the platform on Higgins street and the time he saw him hanging from the ladder. It is difficult to suppose that a boy of that age could, within that short space of time, have got over to the place at which he passed Voss running towards the train, climbed the ladder on the side of the car and passed over to the ladder on the rear of the car.\nIf the learned trial judge was right in the view he took, accepting Voss\u2019s account that the child dashed from the lower part of Ellen street not far from Henry to the train, mounted the ladder and was knocked off by the jerk of the train in starting, all in a \u201cfew seconds,\u201d as the trial judge finds, that this occurred when Crick\u2019s face was turned towards the easternmost car, and when Boardman\u2019s face was turned in the opposite direction, it would seem to have been the merest accident indeed that this little lad in his rapid dash escaped the observation of both the trainman and the constable.\nThe contention on behalf of the respondent is that Messier should have been kept on duty until the train was hauled out. I have already pointed out that there is no rule of law by which the appellants owe a duty to adults or to children to prevent them trespassing on their cars. If they permit such trespasses, then they may incur the obligations of licensees, but the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that everything that could reasonably be done was done to keep children away from the cars while the drag was being assembled. Messier\u2019s primary duty was to warn people using the street of the approach of the train. Very naturally and properly, he was required to keep children away from the cars; occasionally a child would attempt to get on a car and would have to be driven away. Apart altogether from humanitarian considerations, the railway company probably understood the risk from the legal point of view of permitting the children to trespass. I see no reason to reject the view of the trial judge that, after the drag was assembled and while the train was stationary under the care of the hauling crew, they had no reasonable ground to suppose that, in the presence of the hauling crew passing up and down the south side of the train, as has been explained, and of the constable, any child attempting to get on the train would escape observation; there is no suggestion in the evidence of any other child having attempted to do so on the same or any other occasion after the hauling crew came on duty.\nIn this connection it should be observed that the evidence all points to the conclusion that the danger of approaching the train when the engine was attached was quite well understood even by children. The little boy says, and what he says has in it the probability of truth, that two boys who were with him when he approached the train refused to climb with him on the car and he adds (where he got the information does not appear) that they saw the engine and he did not.\nI come now to the Excelsior Wire Rope case[42]. The facts in their general features are important. The appellants there had a siding on some land which was the property of the Marquis of Bute, and, as a haulage apparatus, they had on the same property a post and sheave to which wires and ropes were attached and which was worked by a dynamo. Children used the vicinity of this post and sheave as a playground. They played uninterruptedly, not only in the vicinity, but with the machine and ropes and other things attached to it, except on the occasions, a few times a week, when the machine was just to be put into operation; and then it was the duty and the practice of the employees working the machine to see that the children were not in danger. Except on these occasions, they were permitted to play with the machine.\nThe case was tried by Shearman J. who\nheld that the appellants were liable on the ground that the appellants had acquiesced in children frequenting the siding, so as to constitute the children licensees, and that the setting in motion of the haulage apparatus constituted a trap * * * (p. 405).\nThere was an appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nThe Lords Justices proceeded on the assumption that the children were trespassers, and held that their injuries were caused by an act done by the appellants\u2019 servants with reckless disregard of the presence of children whom they had every reason to think might be injured. (pp 405-406). The pertinent facts are stated by Lord Buckmaster who delivered the leading judgment in the House of Lords:\nOn August 5, 1927, the Excelsior Wire Rope Works were going to use this line for one of their trucks. There is evidence that just before it was in fact so used a little child was seen swinging on the wire. What actually happened is a matter about which there is no direct testimony at all. There were two men whose business it was to superintend the operations, one named Williams and the other named Osborne, and they both came up to the sheave for the purpose, no doubt, of seeing that the wire was properly put round the pulley, and also for the purpose of driving the children away. They knew the children would be there, and because of that knowledge, before putting the wire in motion, they used to go and send them away. * * * There is no doubt that these people do what is obviously their duty to do in the circumstances, that is, go and adjust the wire, and when doing that see if there are any children before they start the work. They did that on this occasion, but they went back and started the machinery without being clear that the wire was free from children, and one little child who was either sitting on it or playing with it\u2014what she was actually doing no one knows\u2014got her hands entangled in the machinery, and her little brother, who came to help her, got his hand injured too.\nHis conclusion is as follows:\nTo the knowledge of the Excelsior Wire Rope Company these children played uninterruptedly round the post; there was nothing to prevent them doing it, and I cannot find that there is any evidence to show that, except at the moment when this machine was going to be set in action, they were ever driven away. It was therefore well known to the appellants that when this machine was going to start it was extremely likely that children would be there and, with the wire in motion, would be exposed to grave danger.\nIn such circumstances the duty owed by appellants, when they set the machinery in motion, was to see that no child was there, and this duty they failed to discharge.\nLord Warrington says:\nThere is ample evidence that, to the knowledge of the servants of the appellants, children were in the habit, not only of playing around this sheave and using it for purposes connected with their games, but were actually in the habit of playing with the machine, and the ropes and so forth attached to it, so that it was found necessary, when they were about to use the machine, to see that it had not been put out of gear by the children. Under those circumstances, it seems to me quite plain that there was a duty upon the present appellants, by their servants, when they were about to put this machine in motion, so that it would become a danger to any children who might be in the neighbourhood, to see whether or not at that moment there were children in such a position as to be exposed to danger. That duty was plainly neglected, and under the circumstances I think the appellants have rightly been held liable.\nLord Thankerton says (p. 414):\n* * * the children not only had constant and free access to the machine itself, but clearly to the knowledge of the appellants they were in the habit of interfering and playing with both the post and the wire rope, and it was only when the occasion of putting the machine into operation arose that there was any question of keeping the children away from that spot. My Lords, that last fact itself appears to me to recognize a necessity and a duty to see that the children were away from this dangerous machine.\nLord Dunedin says: On the assumption that the children were not licensees the appellants\u2019 servants acted \u201cwith reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser,\u201d quoting from the judgment of Lord Hailsham in Addie\u2019s case[43].\nThe decision really rests upon the circumstances that the children habitually and with the permission of the defendants played with the machine except when, on the occasions when it was to be put into motion, they were actually kept away from it. The persons responsible for putting the machine in motion knew that children in the ordinary course would be there and in a position of danger and, on the occasion in question, that it was extremely likely they would be in such a position.\nThis decision can have no application to the present case. It is true that occasionally children climbed on the cars while the drag was being assembled, but they were always sent away. The learned judge has in effect negatived the conclusion that the hauling crew ought to have been aware that some child would likely be on one of the cars, or even might be on one of the cars, at the time the signal was given. There was none of the probability or practical certainty of children being in danger, which was averred in Taylor\u2019s case[44].\nThere was nothing in the conduct of the railway company, as in the Excelsior case[45], to encourage the children to think they were safe in playing near the cars except when they were driven away. The constable was there, whose duty it was to keep people away from the cars, the foreman and his trainman had walked the whole length of the drag immediately before the signal was given and had seen no child in dangerous proximity to the cars. The evidence warrants the finding of fact that, with the exception of the respondent and, possibly, his two companions, in the dash at the last instant, there were no children in any place of danger in respect of the train after the hauling crew came on duty. It was the sudden unanticipated dash of the child which the hauling crew could not, in any reasonable view of the situation, be expected to anticipate, that made the accident possible.\nTo summarize briefly: the respondent is precluded from recovering by reason of the fact that, being a trespasser, the only duty owing to him is that explained in Barnett\u2019s case[46], not intentionally to injure him or \u201cnot to do a wilful act in disregard of humanity towards him,\u201d \u201cnot to act with reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser.\u201d The findings of the learned trial judge, which completely negative any such misconduct by the appellants, are quite adequately supported by the evidence. The case has no analogy to Lynch v. Nurdin[47] (whatever be the legal explanation of that case) where a horse and cart were left wholly unattended in a public street and where the injury suffered by the child on whose behalf the action was brought was caused by another child interfering with the horse and putting the horse and cart into motion, as well as the fact that the plaintiff himself had climbed into the cart and where, as Lord Denman said, \u201cit was extremely probable that some other person would unjustifiably set\u201d the horse and cart \u201cin motion to the injury of a third.\u201d It has no analogy to Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor[48], where the Corporation had caused a shrub bearing poisonous berries to grow in a place frequented by children, knowing, as the pursuer averred, that children would probably, even certainly, eat the berries; that this would certainly be followed by illness or death; and, knowing the poisonous character of the berries, failed to give any warning to the parents or others responsible for the safety of children in the park. In Taylor\u2019s case48, the elements of concealment and surprise and of knowledge of the Corporation of the probability or certainty that children would eat the berries, were the foundation of the judgment. It has no analogy to the Excelsior Wire Rope Company\u2019s case[49], where the defendants knew that, in the ordinary course, children would be playing, not only near the machine, but with the machine itself and its attachments, unless steps were taken to keep them away from it when the machine was put into operation; and knew it to be \u201cextremely probable\u201d that there would be children in a position of danger when the machine was put into operation on the particular occasion on which the plaintiff was injured. Nor does it bear the least resemblance to Cooke\u2019s case (supra)[50], where the children were licensed to be in the field where the turntable was and to play on the turntable itself; where the turntable was a trap in the full sense of the judgment of Hamilton L.J. (though usually locked in a way that it could not be set in motion by a child, it was on the particular occasion unlocked), and there was, as the Lords held, an extreme probability that the children playing on the turntable would set it in motion to the injury of themselves or others. Even on these facts, Lord Loreburn assented with great hesitation, saying that the case was near the line.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge negative the existence of any knowledge on the part of the appellant company or the train crew of the certainty or the reasonable likelihood that any children would be on one of the cars at the time the train was put in motion. Leave and licence were expressly disclaimed in the very able and candid argument of Mr. Thorson. The evidence is wholly incompatible with any suggestion that the conduct of the company in any way inspired (as in the Excelsior case[51]) among the children a belief that it was safe to play in close proximity to the cars except when they were driven away.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Adamson restored. I assume the appellants will not ask for costs.\nAs to the appeal against the judgment in favour of the mother, we announced at the hearing that there was no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and that we should not reserve judgment in order to enable the appellants to apply for leave. It stands dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\nDavis J.\u2014The respondent, the infant plaintiff, when a little less than four and a half years old, climbed a ladder on the side of a standing freight car belonging to the appellant railway company and then lost his balance and fell to the ground with the result that one of his legs was so injured as to require amputation below the knee. This action was brought by his widowed mother, personally and as his next friend, against the railway company for damages.\nThe freight car was standing at the time on railway tracks that were on a public street in the City of Winnipeg. We have therefore to consider the case not only in the light of the private rights of the railway company in its own property, but of the public rights of the child upon the street. Nothing turns in the case upon the right of the railway company to operate its railway upon the street in question. Counsel for the plaintiff at the trial admitted that the tracks in question were properly upon the street and that the defendant was lawfully entitled to operate its railway where it did upon the street. With this admission of public authority in the railway, the case cannot be treated in law as one of nuisance, and falls to be determined upon the question of negligence. That distinction is fundamental, and it seems to me that failure to bear that distinction in mind may have accounted for some of the divergent views in the court below.\nThe case then, like all cases of negligence, turns upon its own particular facts. The street in question is 66 feet wide; the railway track occupies the northerly 14 feet thereof; of the southerly 52 feet, 34 feet 4 inches adjoining the railway track is paved and used by vehicles, and the remainder, 17 feet 8 inches, is a cinder path for pedestrians and a boulevard. The railway track in question extends along the street a distance of some 2,900 feet and was in daily use by the railway company for the assembling of freight trains. Freight trains would be made up of a variable number and of different types of freight cars necessary for particular runs. The cars would be picked up from other tracks and collected or assembled upon the particular track or siding with which we are concerned. A \u201cswitch\u201d engine used for assembling would back down the track the different cars that had been selected for a particular run. The first car or group of cars would be backed down to the rear end of the track and then the next car or group of cars would be backed down to meet the cars already placed in position, and so on until the whole train would be assembled. This involved, as one can readily understand, a good deal of movement and shunting of the cars on the track in the process of assembling the train. On the day in question the particular freight train that had been assembled consisted of 55 cars, with a total length of about 2,200 feet. Now whenever a freight train had been assembled, the engine that had been used in assembling the cars and the \u201cshed\u201d or \u201cassembling\u201d crew in charge of that operation would depart for some other siding where a similar operation had become necessary. The company employed one Messier, a disabled employee, to be present during the assembling operations to warn persons against crossing the tracks when the cars were being placed in position. Then, when the time came that the assembled train was to proced on its journey, a different engine and a different crew would come to take it away. The hauling crew consisted of an engineer, a fireman, a yard foreman and two yardmen. The movement of the train at this time would be a forward movement and involved no switching or shunting.\nThe accident happened after the assembling crew had completed its operations and had left the track in question and during the time that the hauling crew had arrived to take the train away to another place. The infant plaintiff had climbed the ladder of one of the freight cars (about the fourteenth car from the rear end of the train) and was thrown from the car either at the moment that the hauling engine attached itself to the train or at the moment that the hauling engine commenced to pull the cars out. The period of time between these two events would be a matter of only a minute or two and the evidence does not make plain, and it is really a matter of no consequence, the exact moment that the child fell. The child was unquestionably a trespasser on the car, the private property of the railway company. Counsel for the plaintiff, however, focuses our attention upon the public right of the child to be upon the street and asks us to treat the freight cars in question as an allurement to children generally and presents a case against the railway company of alleged negligence based upon evidence that was directed to shew that the railway company knew that children in the neighbourhood, and particularly at the very place on the street where the accident occurred, were accustomed to play upon the street in and around the freight cars and occasionally were even known to climb upon the cars. The statement of claim puts the case against the defendant in these words: that the defendant by its agents, servants or employees negligently caused the said freight cars to be set in motion without any warning to the said plaintiff.\nand that\nthe defendant, its agents, servants and employees, having the knowledge hereinbefore alleged, well knew or should have known that small children, such as and including the plaintiff, being adventuresome, would be likely to be allured and enticed and attracted as the said plaintiff and the said several other small boys were in fact allured, enticed and attracted, and would be likely to respond to the invitation and yield to the temptation held out * * * and would; be likely to climb the said ladders and hang and ride on the said freight cars * * * and that injury such as that which actually did result to the said plaintiff would be likely to result, if the said railway tracks were left unprotected by the defendant or the said freight cars were left unattended by the defendant, or the said freight cars were set in motion without adequate warning and precautions by the defendant, or small children such as and including the said plaintiff were not prevented by the defendant from coming near or being on the said freight cars while they were in motion.\nWhere, as here, there is admitted public authority to maintain and operate a railway upon a public street, the presence and movement of cars is the inevitable result of the ordinary exercise of such authority. Lord Dunedin in Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth[52] said:\nWhen Parliament has authorized a certain thing to be made or done in a certain place, there can be no action for nuisance caused by the making or doing of that thing if the nuisance is the inevitable result of the making or doing so authorized.\nBut the company is responsible, of course, in an action of negligence for any want of reasonable care in its operations.\nNo one of the railway crew engaged at the time and at the place of the accident in moving the train saw the child before he fell from the car. The case made against the railway company is that the railway crew, or some of them, ought to have seen the child or that under all the circumstances, having regard to the habit of children to play upon the street near cars left standing there, the railway company did not take special precautions or give an adequate warning before moving the train.\nThere is evidence that the children in the neighbourhood, to the knowledge of the defendant, played on the street in question, particularly in the evenings after supper; that the older children played games in a vacant yard across the street from the place of the accident, leaving the smaller children to play somewhere else; that the children were in the habit of playing on a loading platform, across the street from the place of the accident, which lay alongside a spur track of the defendant. There is evidence that children frequently played near the cars on the tracks. One witness, Hobson Sr., said that he had seen from thirty to fifty children at times playing on the street after supper in the immediate neighbourhood of the accident. It is further in evidence that when children were playing ball in the yard across the street, the ball often went over the fence, rolled across the street and under the train of cars standing on the tracks on the street; that sometimes the children would get the ball themselves and sometimes Messier would get the ball for them; that sometimes the children climbed under the cars to get the ball and sometimes they would ask Messier whether they might go and get the ball. Hobson, Jr., a boy of 17, said that Messier used to tell the boys when it was all right to go across and get the ball, and the boys would then climb up the ladder steps between the cars, go over the couplings and then climb down the other side. He had done this himself and had seen other boys do it. Stevens, a night watchman at a factory nearby, said he had frequently seen boys and girls go under the cars to get the ball and was always afraid that an accident would happen where it did. There is some evidence that children at times climbed up on the freight cars when they were standing on the street. Gustaffson, a boy of fifteen, said that he had seen a boy on a ladder of a freight car, once. Messier said that children did actually climb on the cars, \u201cas often as he could not stop them,\u201d but that when they did, he stopped them as part of his duty, took his cane to them and chased them away. Voss, a boy of thirteen, said that Messier \u201cused to chase the kids off the box cars.\u201d\nCounsel for the plaintiff presents this picture of a dangerous situation known to the railway company. But it must be observed that the railway company had no right to keep children off the public street. Messier said that it was part of his duty during the assembling of the trains to keep children away from the cars. He was discharged by the railway company the day after the accident and colour is put upon the picture by that fact, though the railway company explained his dismissal upon other grounds than his absence from the place of the accident at the time the accident occurred. The child gave unsworn testimony at the trial quantum valeat. He was then about six years of age. He said he saw three other boys and he said to them,\n\u201cLet us go to the train.\u201d So we went to the train, and then we sat down * * * on the first seat (meaning, I take it, the first rung of the ladder) and then I said, \u201cLet us climb.\u201d And they said \u201cNo.\u201d And I went up and then they seen the engine coming * * * They didn\u2019t tell me that the engine was coming and I didn\u2019t even see it, and they were running. I didn\u2019t know what they were running for. When I got to the top, I climbed around to the back and it jerked and my foot slipped, and I fell.\nThe child did not name any of the three other boys to whom he refers and no one of them was called as a witness. It is plain, however, upon the evidence that the child was thrown from the ladder on the back of the car by the \u201cjerk\u201d or \u201cbump\u201d of the train. While the exact moment of the accident is, as I have said, of little consequence, it seems clear that when the hauling engine attached itself to the cars there was a jerk or a bump to the particular car upon which the child had climbed.\nAn important fact to be determined is whether the child had been playing with other children around the freight cars before he climbed the ladder on one of the cars or whether he had suddenly run across the street by himself and climbed up the ladder at once. The boy Hobson said in his evidence that when he first saw the infant plaintiff that night \u201che was playing with some other boys around the freight cars,\u201d but on cross-examination Hobson leaves the exact place where he said he first saw the infant plaintiff very doubtful, for he then says, \u201cRight around where the tracks switch off into the platform on the lot east of the vacant lot * * * He wasn\u2019t on the platform; he was playing on the street near there.\u201d Voss, another boy, tells a totally different story. Voss says that he himself was lying down on a side street, Ellen Street, about half way in between Higgins and Henry Streets, and he says that when he first saw the infant plaintiff, \u201che was running past us,\u201d on Ellen Street, \u201ctowards the box cars, to the north. He started climbing up the side of a box car that was standing still, then went over on to the ladder on the back of the box car.\u201d The trial judge[53] accepted the evidence of Voss, though he is in error in stating that young Voss said that the infant plaintiff \u201cwith two other boys ran out of Ellen Street and across Higgins Street north towards the box cars.\u201d The evidence is that Voss was asked, \u201cWho was with you\u2014who was lying down with you?\u201d And his answer was, \u201cThere were some other boys and girls around there.\u201d But Voss very definitely says that the place on Ellen Street where he was lying on the grass \u201cwas about half a block away\u201d from the car on which the infant plaintiff had climbed. Voss said that when the train started with a jerk and knocked the infant plaintiff\u2019s feet from under him and he was just hanging on with his hands, he and two other boys started toward the ear. Hobson was one of these boys and another was Gustaffson. Hobson ran with Voss to the car but Gustaffson turned sick at the sight of the infant plaintiff and did not go on to the car. The trial judge in delivering his judgment plainly accepted the evidence given by Voss rather than the evidence of Hobson, who said that he saw the infant plaintiff playing with some other boys around the freight cars, for the trial judge, after referring to the evidence of Voss, said,\nHe (the infant plaintiff) ran out a few moments before the train started and evaded being seen by the trainmen or the constable who had both passed the car to which he ran a short time before.\nThe hauling crew were on duty making ready for the train to be pulled out. This crew, if I may repeat, consisted of an engineer, a fireman, a yard foreman and two yardmen. The foreman of the crew, Wilkinson, and one of the yardmen, Boardman, had walked along the full length of the train on the opposite side from what may be called the street and then walked back along the street side about 600 feet from the rear end of the train to a point not far from the exact place of the accident. Boardman waited there, looking toward the engine as was his duty (with his back to the place where the child climbed on one of the cars). Wilkinson continued along the street side of the train toward the engine which was some considerable distance ahead. The engine was brought to the train by the other yardman, Smith; Wilkinson gave the signal to proceed; Boardman gave him the signal that the cars were all moving; Wilkinson repeated this to the engineer; the yardman climbed on the train, and the train proceeded. Another employee of the railway company, Crick, a constable, had gone up and down the cars on each side testing the seals. Just before the train started he was in the act of testing the seal on the street side of the last car. He turned round and saw three boys running across the street and then run alongside the train. Crick started after them and when the speed of the train increased he jumped on the train and came to the point where the infant plaintiff was lying at the time. Wilkinson, Boardman and Crick all stated that there were no children near the train as they had walked up and down beside it. Crick, the constable, said that he considered it to be part of his duty to warn children away. It was not suggested that any of the crew or Crick saw the child.\nIn the opinion of Mr. Justice Adamson, the trial judge, the defendant company \u201cdid all that was reasonable to see that all was clear when the train started,\u201d and he dismissed the action with costs. Upon an appeal, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba by a majority (Dennistoun and Trueman JJ.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal and directed judgment to be entered in favour of the infant plaintiff in the sum of $5,000 and in favour of the adult plaintiff, the mother of the child, in the sum of $800. From that judgment the railway company appealed to this Court. No leave having been granted to appeal in respect of the judgment in favour of the adult plaintiff, there was no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the appeal against her, and, at the conclusion of the argument, we dismissed the appeal against the adult plaintiff. The sole question reserved was as to the right of the infant plaintiff to hold the judgment in his favour in the sum of $5,000.\nThe child was, strictly, a trespasser upon the freight car of the defendant, and it is clear upon the evidence that no one in the employ of the railway company saw the child either approaching the cars or upon the car from which he was thrown. The question is whether or not, notwithstanding these facts, there was a duty in law upon the railway company under all circumstances to take care of the child. Counsel for the infant plaintiff, while admitting that the child was, strictly speaking, a trespasser on the car, contended that under all the facts and circumstances of the case the child should be treated as a licensee or the defendant\u2019s conduct should be treated as such a neglect of a duty to take care as to entitle the infant plaintiff to succeed in law. Mr. Thorson, in his very able and exhaustive argument on behalf of the infant plaintiff, placed much reliance upon the judgment in the old case of Lynch v. Nurdin[54]. In that case the defendant left his horse and cart unattended in the street and the plaintiff child, seven years old, climbed into the cart in play, another child incautiously led the horse on and the plaintiff child thereby fell out and suffered injuries. It was held that the defendant was liable, although the plaintiff child was a trespasser on the cart and contributed to the mischief by his own act. That decision, nearly a hundred years old, has been much discussed in subsequent cases and the judgment may very properly be regarded now as really founded upon the fact that the horse and cart were an allurement to young children and, being left in the street wholly unattended, constituted a trap. In the recent case of Liddle v. Yorkshire[55], Slesser, L.J., discussed Lynch v. Nurdin54 and said, at p. 129:\nAlthough Lynch v. Nurdin[56] remains an authority on the question of contributory negligence of children, the present state of the law seems to me to justify me in declining to think that it binds me to-day to say that the defendants are liable when they do not put a trap intentionally or intend to injure if the plaintiff is a trespasser.\nIn Harrold v. Watney (4), the defendant was the owner of a fence abutting on a highway. The plaintiff, a child of four years of age, attracted by some boys at play on the other side of the fence, put his foot on it, and it fell on and injured him. The jury found that the fence was very defective but actually fell through the plaintiff standing wholly or partly on it, though not for the purpose of climbing over. The trial judge directed that judgment should be entered for the defendant but the Court of Appeal held that, the defective fence being a nuisance and the cause of the injuries to the plaintiff, the defendant was liable. But even in cases of nuisance there will be no liability to the child unless the thing through which the accident happened was something that was likely to attract children to intermeddle with it and was dangerous if intermeddled with. Thus, in Donovan v. Union Cartage Co. (5)[57] an unhorsed van belonging to the defendants was left by them, unattended, in a public street outside their premises. The plaintiff, an infant aged seven years, while playing in the street with other children, climbed on to the van, fell and was injured. It was held, in an action for negligence, that the defendants, the owners of the van, were not liable because there was no inherent danger in a sound, stationary and immobile vehicle, left unattended in the street, and even if the stationary van was an obstruction to the use of the highway, there was no relation of cause and effect between an obstruction to the use of the highway and the occurrence of the accident.\nIn Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland)[58], Lord Atkinson at p. 237 said that the authorities from Lynch v. Nurdin[59] downward established, it appeared to him, first, that every person must be taken to know that young children and boys are of a very inquisitive and frequently mischievous disposition, and are likely to meddle with whatever happens to come within their reach; secondly, that the public streets, roads, and public places may not unlikely be frequented by children of tender years and boys of this character; and, thirdly, that if vehicles or machines are left by their owners, or by the agents of the owners, in any place which children and boys of this kind are rightfully entitled to frequent, and are not unlikely actually to frequent, unattended or unguarded and in such a state or position as to be calculated to attract or allure these boys or children to intermeddle with them, and to be dangerous if intermeddled with, then the owners of these machines or vehicles will be responsible in damages for injuries sustained by these juvenile inter-meddlers through the negligence of the former in leaving their machines or vehicles in such places under such conditions, even though the accident causing the injury be itself brought about by the intervention of a third party, or the injured person, in any particular case, be a trespasser on the vehicle or machine at the moment the accident occurred.\nThis decision in Cooke v. Midland[60] was much criticized and Lord Atkinson took occasion in Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor[61] to point out the ratio decidendi of the Cooke case60 when he said at p. 53, referring to it, The decision of this House in the first of these two cases has, no doubt, been frequently criticized. I am familiar with the criticisms, and have noticed that in them not unfrequently either no weight or not full weight is given to the vital fact that there was evidence there to go to the jury from which they might reasonably conclude that the children mentioned in that case not only entered upon the lands of the company with its leave and licence, but also played upon the dangerous machine, the turntable, they found there, with that very same leave and licence.\nAnd Lord Atkinson continued at p. 54,\nAnd I, myself, after referring to the question which would arise in a case where the boys or children were trespassers, proceeded to say: \u201cIn the view I take it is not necessary to determine that question in the present case, because I think there was evidence proper to be submitted to the jury that the children living in the neighbourhood of this triangular piece of ground, of which the plaintiff was one, not only entered upon it, but also played upon the turntable\u2014a most important addition\u2014with the leave and licence of the defendant company.\u201d Such were the real facts and the real question decided in Cooke v. Midland Great Western Ry. Co. of Ireland[62].\nLord Shaw, at p. 63 of the Glasgow case[63] said:\nI do not desire, my Lords, to close my opinion without stating that I attach my express concurrence to the statement of my noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson in regard to the true scope and effect of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Ry. Co. of Ireland62.\nIn the Liddle case[64], Lord Justice Scrutton said at p. 111 that confusion was temporarily introduced into the law of England by the decision of the House of Lords in Cooke v. Midland62 but he thought,\nit is now established by the judgment in Latham v. Johnson[65] and the explanation of Cooke\u2019s case62 by Lord Atkinson in Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor (5) that Cooke\u2019s case62 must be treated as the case of a child impliedly licensed to use a plaything which was, for a child, a trap.\nGrand Trunk Railway Company v. Barnett[66] was a case that went to the Judicial Committee from the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Pere Marquette Railway Company had each a station and railway yards a short distance from each other in the city of London, Ontario. The Grand Trunk Railway, under some arrangement with the Pere Marquette Railway, allowed the latter company\u2019s trains, or some of them, access to the Grand Trunk Company\u2019s station by means of a cross line so as to bring the Pere Marquette train up to the Grand Trunk station. The particular train concerned in the accident was the Pere Marquette train, which had arrived at the Grand Trunk station and had duly discharged its passengers at the platform of the Grand Trunk station. Its ordinary and proper course then was to wait till it received a signal from the Grand Trunk switch operator, after which it would back out over the Grand Trunk tracks and return to the Pere Marquette yard to remain for the night. The plaintiff was aware of this practice, and on the night in question he came into the Grand Trunk station and, going to the Pere Marquette train before it began to back out, he jumped on the platform at the rear end of the car and stood with one foot on the platform and one foot on the step, his object being to get a lift as far as the Pere Marquette station, which was on his way home. He was aware that the train was not at that moment in use as a passenger train, he had no ticket and did not pretend that he received any invitation or had any right to do what he did. The Pere Marquette train backed as usual along the cross line and while still on the property of the Grand Trunk Company, a freight train of that company, which was being made up at an adjacent siding, was negligently backed so as to come into collision with the train on which the plaintiff was standing. He was thereby thrown off the car platform and seriously injured. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion, the plaintiff was a trespasser both on the premises of the Grand Trunk Company and on the train of the Pere Marquette Company. On the footing that the plaintiff was a trespasser the question was, what, under the circustances of the case, were his rights against the Grand Trunk Company? Lord Robson, in delivering the judgment, said, at p. 369:\nThe railway company was undoubtedly under a duty to the plaintiff not wilfully to injure him; they were not entitled, unnecessarily and knowingly, to increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way, but to say that they were liable to a trespasser for the negligence of their servants is to place them under a duty to him of the same character as that which they undertake to those whom they carry for reward. The authorities do not justify the imposition of any such obligation in such circumstances.\nAnd at p. 370:\nAgain, even if he be a trespasser, a question may arise as to whether or not the injury was due to some wilful act of the owner of the land involving something worse than the absence of reasonable care. An instance of this occurred where an owner placed a horse he knew to be savage in a field which he knew to be used by persons as a short cut on their way to a railway station: Lowery v. Walker[67]. In cases of that character there is a wilful or reckless disregard of ordinary humanity rather than mere absence of reasonable care.\nIn Addie v. Dumbreck[68], the House of Lords had to consider a case where the plaintiff claimed damages for the death of his son, a child of four, who had been crushed in the terminal wheel of a haulage system belonging to a colliery company. The system was used in a field owned by the company and consisted of an endless wire cable operated from the pithead by an electric motor, while at the other end of the system, which was not visible from the pithead, there was a heavy iron wheel round which the cable passed and returned. The field was surrounded by a hedge which was quite inadequate to keep out the public, and it was used, to the knowledge of the company, as a playground by young children. The company officials at times warned children out of the field but their warnings were disregarded. The wheel was dangerous and attractive to children and at the time of the accident it was insufficiently protected. The accident occurred owing to the wheel being set in motion by the company\u2019s servants without taking any precaution to avoid accident to persons frequenting the field. The House of Lords held unanimously that the child was a trespasser and went on the premises at his own risk and that the company owed him no duty to protect him from injury. In the following year, however, in Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan[69], the House of Lords was presented with a case which, upon a superficial examination of the facts, might seem to require a similar decision. But the facts of this case when carefully examined were materially different from those in Addie v. Dumbreck[70] and the House gave judgment for the plaintiff. Lord Dunedin was prepared, if it were necessary, to describe the children, upon the special facts of the case, as licensees to whom the defendants owed an obvious duty of care. But if they were to be regarded as trespassers, he considered the conduct of the defendants to be so reckless as to amount to an intent to injure. Lord Thankerton, at the top of p. 414, sets the facts out thus:\n* * * the children not only had constant and free access to the machine itself, but clearly to the knowledge of the appellants they were in the habit of interfering and playing with both the post and the wire rope, and it was only when the occasion of putting the machine into operation arose that there was any question of keeping the children away from that spot. My Lords, that last fact itself appears to me to recognize a necessity and a duty to see that the children were away from this dangerous machine.\nUpon that state of the facts the children were obviously where they were with the leave and licence of the company. But as Lord Dunedin said, assuming that the children were trespassers, he thought that the company\u2019s servants acted, to use the words of Viscount Hailsham in Addie\u2019s case[71], \u201cwith reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser,\u201d or, in his own words, \u201cthat the acting was so reckless as to amount to malicious acting.\u201d\nThe American cases, such as Railroad Company v. Stout[72], have taken what has been said to be a more humanitarian or liberal view of the duties of an occupier of dangerous premises toward children trespassing thereon and coming to harm. In the last edition of Salmond on Torts (8th edition) at p. 529, the editor says that\nIn England it may be said with some confidence that no such rule of liability is recognized.\nLord Justice Scrutton in the Liddell case[73] said:\nI agree with the view of Mr. Justice Salmond in his work on Torts (7th ed.) at p. 472, where he says, \u201cThe humanitarian impulse which prompts such decisions as that of Railroad Company v. Stout[74] and seeks to impose upon the occupiers of premises a legal duty in the guardianship of infant trespassers will in the long run do more harm than good. The duty of preventing babies from trespassing upon a railway line should lie upon their parents, and not upon the railway company.\u201d\nIt is not shown in the case before us that at the time of the accident the infant plaintiff was where he was by the leave or licence of the railway company, nor can it be fairly said upon the evidence that the railway company\u2019s conduct toward the infant plaintiff was such wilful or reckless disregard of his presence on the freight car as to amount to malicious conduct toward him. To hold the railway company liable in damages to the infant would make the railway company virtually an insurer of a trespasser.\nThere is no course open to us upon the settled law as I understand it but to allow the appeal and dismiss the action, with costs if asked for. Kerwin J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s railway tracks were legally on the highway, Higgins avenue, and at the time of the accident the company\u2019s employees were lawfully engaged in moving the railway cars. The infant respondent was entitled to be on the highway but not on the appellant\u2019s cars.\nThe trial judge has found that, after what has been called the assembling of the cars had been completed, the boy \u201cran out a few moments before the train started and evaded being seen by the trainmen or the constable who had both passed the car to which he ran a short time before.\u201d I understand this to mean, not that the boy, who was then but four and a half years of age, intentionally waited until he saw the coast was clear but that he ran out when none of the appellant\u2019s employees happened to be looking. I agree that in fact, this is something against which the appellant could not guard, and in law, conduct which it was not incumbent upon the appellant to foresee.\nThe authorities are legion and not easy to reconcile. Two of the recent cases in the House of Lords, Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd. v. Dumbreck[75] and Excelsior Wire Rope Company v. Callan[76], are referred to in Mourton v. Poulter[77] and in the 8th Edition of Salmond on \u201cTorts,\u201d 527. Lord Justice Scrutton in the Mourton case77 and the editor of the text-book seem to agree that the difference between the two cases is that in the latter the trespassers were, and in the former they were not, known to be present. In my opinion that is a correct statement of the distinction.\nIn the present case, while the appellant\u2019s employees knew that children were playing in the enclosed field, on the landing platform, and on the street, the fact that the boy darted to the cars and commenced climbing one of them disposes of any contention that the employees knew or should have known that the young lad either was on the cars or that he might run out and climb upon them. With respect, I find myself unable to agree with the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba[78] that \u201ccommensurate care must be exercised however wide the field of danger\u201d as that begs the question of the duty owing by the appellant to the infant. And on the evidence, I cannot find that \u201cthe field of particular danger, as well known by the company, was practically restricted to the corner in question.\u201d The evidence discloses that the children played at other spots along the length of Higgins avenue, and, in any event, we are concerned with what actually did transpire and not with what might be the situation under other circumstances.\nTwo late cases in England, Donovan v. Union Cartage Company[79] and Liddle v. Yorkshire (North Riding) County Council[80], indicate the limits within which an infant trespasser must fall in order to entitled it to recover. However, in my view, nothing can be gained by an exhaustive survey of all the decided cases. In each the question must be the extent of the duty owing by one party to the other, and in the case at bar I am unable to find that the appellant owed any duty to the infant which it failed to fulfil. So far as the judgment for $5,000 in favour of the infant plaintiff is concerned, the appeal should therefore be allowed, with costs if demanded.\nOn the argument the attention of counsel was drawn to the fact that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in favour of the adult plaintiff was for $800 and costs, and that no order granting special leave to appeal had been obtained. The appeal from the judgment in favour of the adult plaintiff was thereupon dismissed.\nCrocket J. (dissenting):\u2014The defendant many years ago was permitted by the City of Winnipeg to lay a railway track along the northerly side of Higgins avenue as an adjunct of its terminal yards system, which occupies an extensive area abutting the northerly side line of that street. This track is known as K lead and extends along the avenue a distance of 2,900 feet. There is no fence or visible boundary between the terminal yards proper and the street, so that the lead practically forms part of the railway terminal system, though for most of its length it is planked between the rails and for a few feet on either side, the rails and planking being flush with the street pavement on the south side. The north rails of the lead are parallel to and about 8 feet from the northerly limit of the avenue, which is 66 feet wide. The lead thus actually forms part of a public street, and with the planks, which border it on either side, and the few feet between the north side planking and the southerly side line of the railway terminal yards proper, occupies nearly one-fourth of the width of the avenue. In its length of 2,900 feet the lead passes two north and south streets which end on the south side of the avenue, viz., St. Patrick\u2019s and Ellen streets. A third street, Lizzie street, intersects Higgins avenue about 600 feet east of Ellen street and runs past the defendant\u2019s local freight shed. There is a cinder path 5\u00bd feet wide all along the south side of the avenue and an open space of 10 or 11 feet, which was described as a boulevard, between it and the south curb of the street pavement. The lots along the south side of the avenue across from the lead are occupied for the most part by warehouses and industrial plants, but along the north and south streets and along Henry avenue, which parallels Higgins avenue about 176 feet to the south, there are many dwellings from which children come to Higgins avenue to play in the evening hours. There is a large vacant lot at the northeasterly corner of Ellen street, surrounded by a board fence with a gate affording entrance and exit from and to the south side of Higgins avenue directly across from the lead and in which children were in the habit of playing ball and other games. Just east of this lot there is a loading platform, to which a railway spur curves across the street pavement and the boulevard, upon which children frequently played after supper, and the approach to which rises gradually from the level of the avenue.\nFor some years past, the railway has used the Higgins avenue track after 5 o\u2019clock every afternoon except Sunday for the assembling of a westbound freight train. In accordance with its usual practice, an assembling or shed crew, as it was called, went to work for the purpose stated at 5 o\u2019clock p.m. on April 18, 1933, with a switch engine, which collected cuts of from 10 to 14 cars in the adjoining yard and backed these cuts down, one at a time, on to K lead over a switch curve at its westerly end until the whole train or drag, as it is called, of 55 cars was assembled. When completed this drag extended from a point about 150 feet west of Lizzie street to a point on the curved track at the west end of the lead\u2014a distance of about 2,200 feet and was left standing on the lead for another crew, called the hauling crew, to take over and move on to another track in the adjoining terminal yards. After the assembling crew had finished their work and left the lead and while the drag was standing on the track awaiting its transfer to the yard, while it was still daylight, the infant plaintiff, a boy of four and a half years, started climbing the side ladder of one of the box cars. As this ladder was placed close to the east end of the car, and there was another ladder on the rear of the car within easy reach, the boy after climbing a few rungs of the side ladder, reached around the corner and got on the end ladder, and was in the act of climbing the latter when the train started with a jerk, causing him to fall to the ground outside the south rail. His right leg, however, got across the south rail and was run over by the wheels of the next car and had in consequence to be amputated a few inches below the knee.\nThis action was brought in the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba by the boy\u2019s mother as his next friend to recover damages in his behalf as well as in her own right for hospital and medical expenses she was compelled to pay. It was tried before Adamson J., without a jury. His Lordship found that the defendant did all that was reasonable to see that all was clear when the train started; and, relying on the decision of the House of Lords in Addie v. Dumbreck[81], also held that the boy was a trespasser and the author of his own injury, and for these reasons dismissed the action. On appeal the Court of Appeal, by Prendergast, C.J.M., and Robson and Richards, JJ.A. (Dennistoun and Trueman, JJ.A., dissenting), set aside the trial judgment and awarded $5,000 damages to the infant plaintiff and $800 damages to the mother with costs of appeal as well as of the action throughout.\nThe case, I think, with all respect, is one in which, if there was really any negligence on the part of any of its servants which materially contributed to bring about the boy\u2019s injury, the defendant cannot avail itself of the fact that the infant plaintiff wrongfully got upon the ladder and was consequently a trespasser on the railway car. If he was & trespasser in that sense he was no more so than was the infant plaintiff, a boy aged 7, a trespasser in the cart, which the defendant\u2019s servant left unguarded in the street in Lynch v. Nurdin[82], or than the two infant plaintiffs aged respectively 5 and 9, were on the wire rope, on which they were swinging, in Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan[83]. Yet in both these cases the infant plaintiffs were held entitled to recover, notwithstanding that it was strongly urged that the infant plaintiff in the former and the two infant plaintiffs in the latter were trespassers. Certainly a child too young to be capable of caution or of appreciating a danger, which would be obvious to older children, could not well be held to be guilty of negligence either causing or materially contributing to cause injury or damage.\nThe true test of the liability of the defendant in this case, under the authorities as I read them, is whether the defendant took reasonably adequate precautions to protect children such as the infant plaintiff, with their natural propensities to inquisitiveness, play and mischief, and whom it must be taken to have known through its servants were likely to be upon the street in close proximity to its cars at the time, from the danger attending the assembling and movement of these cars along its railway track, situated, as it was, actually upon a public street, and whether its failure to do so was the cause of the infant plaintiff being upon the ladder when the train was started. Whether the boy was a trespasser, a licensee or an invitee, and the manner in which he came to get on the ladder, is quite irrelevant except in so far as it may bear upon the question of the alleged negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants, as similar considerations were held to be in the recent Excelsior Wire Rope case[84], already cited. In that case Lord Buckmaster, who wrote the leading judgment, referred to some evidence which had been adduced to shew that the children, who were in the habit of playing on the land on which the wire apparatus was placed, were mischievous and had broken lamps by the side of the path which led to that field, and said:\nbut that appears to me to be totally irrelevant. It really is a ridiculous thing to imagine that you can expect the same gravity and decorum from children as that which is sometimes associated with advanced years, and for the purposes of this case it is important to remember that the duty which we are about to examine is a duty to these children.\nIn the same case Lord Atkin said:\nThere has arisen in respect to the duties of owners and occupiers of land an elaborate series of decisions which have involved the consideration of the precise difference between invitees of the occupiers, licensees of the occupiers, or trespassers upon the land. In my view, in this case none of these questions is relevant, * * * The defendants in this case were not occupiers of the land in question. They had a right from the Marquess of Bute, who in fact owned the land, and, as far as I can see on the evidence, was the occupier of the land, to place a line of rails upon it,\nand after pointing out that there was a term in the lease that the Marquess retained the right to make what use he pleased of the land on which the siding was placed subject to there being no unreasonable interference with the siding, His Lordship continued:\nA similar position existed in reference to the erection of this particular hauling machinery that was placed upon this siding (the wire rope apparatus for the movement of trucks along the siding). In those circumstances, my Lords, the only question that appears to me to arise is: What was the obligation on the owners of this hauling machinery to persons who might be endangered by its use?\nThough the defendant had a right, as was admitted on the trial, to assemble cars and move trains on K lead notwithstanding its location upon and along a public street, there can be no doubt that in the exercise of that right it was bound to take such precautions for the avoidance of injury to the public as were fairly commensurate with the danger created by its operations thereon. What degree of care and vigilance the railway owed to the public depends, as indeed it always does in such cases, on the existing conditions and risks, as they were known or ought to have been known to it or to its servants and agents in charge of those operations, but there can, in my opinion, be no question that it was the unmistakable duty of the railway to guard the public as far as was reasonably practicable against any and every danger which its operations created on this highway and which ought reasonably to have been foreseen by those in charge thereof. That there was a special danger at particular points along the lead, arising from the presence of children in close proximity to the railway cars while the train was being made up by the shed crew and in starting it by the hauling crew after its assembly was completed on its transfer to the adjoining yard, cannot, I think, fairly be questioned on the evidence.\nThe witness, Messier, a former switchman in the employ of the defendant, who when so employed had lost a leg in 1925 and was spoken of as an old man, and who at the time of the accident to the infant plaintiff had been employed for about two years as a kind of watchman on Higgins Avenue, during the assembling operations by the shed crew, testified that his duties were \u201cto keep traffic away from the cars and keep the kids away,\u201d by which he explained he meant \u201cthe children away from the cars as they were coming down the street.\u201d Asked where he was supposed to be stationed on Higgins Avenue, he replied, \u201cWell, that is pretty hard to say, but stationed anywhere along the street where there was traffic and where there was kids; down around Ellen Street, the intersection of Ellen and Higgins Avenue.\u201d He told of the vacant lot at the corner on which he said the children played baseball, football and sometimes tag, and of the loading platform just east of it where children played also sometimes, and of children playing as well on Ellen Street and on Higgins Avenue. When asked if children ever climbed on to the box cars, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d\nQ. How often did they do that?\nA. I couldn\u2019t tell you how often, they done it occasionally.\nBy the Court:\nQ. As often as you could not stop them?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You stopped them as often as you saw them, as part of your duty?\nA. Yes.\nBy Mr. Thorson:\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I chased them away from the cars. I took my cane to them.\n* * *\nQ. Coming back to the yard, Mr. Messier, on the southeast corner of Ellen and Higgins you say the children played games there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Ball games?\nA. Ball, any kind of games, all kinds of games.\nQ. Did the ball ever go over the fence across Higgins avenue?\nMr. Reycraft: I object to that and I submit it is all irrelevant. I don\u2019t care whether the ball went over the fence.\nA. Yes, many times.\nQ. Did the ball ever go under the train?\nA. Yes. Q. What happened then?\nA. Sometimes they would get the ball themselves, and sometimes I would get it for them.\nQ. When they got the ball themselves what did they do?\nA. They continued playing.\nQ. But how did they get the ball?\nA. They would go underneath the cars and get the ball, and go away again. Sneak away if I wasn\u2019t around.\nQ. You say that sometimes you would get the ball yourself?\nA. Yes, sometimes I would get the ball for them. Reach in with my stick and knock the ball out.\nQ. Did the children ever ask you whether they might go and get the ball?\nA. Yes, sometimes they would. They would come and tell me their ball was under the cars. I would tell them to leave it there for a few minutes, and I would get it for them.\nCross-Examination by Mr. Reycraft:\nQ. Any time you were on Higgins avenue near the shed and you saw children in danger, you would drive them away, or tell them to go away, you always did that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Wasn\u2019t your duty, Mr. Messier, to watch the point or the end car as they were shunting the different cars down on that siding on that day?\nA. It was partly.\nQ. That is if they had shoved a few cars down and left them on the track, and then they would go back and get some more, and as those were pushed down your duty was to be at the east end of the east car to see nobody passed by there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And when the drag was assembled your duties were through?\nA. Yes.\nThe evidence of Messier was not contradicted, though much reliance was placed by the defendant on the fact that the witness Gustaffson, who gave testimony in its behalf, said that he thought he saw boys climb on the car ladders only once and that he didn\u2019t recall seeing any small boys playing on the street at any time, and on the testimony of some of the members of the hauling crew to the effect that they never saw any more children about the corner of Ellen Street than elsewhere along the avenue.\nAs to the value of Gustaffson\u2019s evidence, it should be pointed out that he was put on the stand for the apparent purpose of substantiating the contention which was put forward by the defendant that the infant plaintiff had not fallen from a car ladder at all but was knocked down by the train while he was running alongside it with another companion. The trial judge rejected his evidence in this regard and found that the infant plaintiff was on the ladder when the train started, as sworn to by two companions of Gustaffson. If one reads Gustaffson\u2019s cross-examination in full one cannot fail, I think, to be impressed by its inconsistency and uncertainty throughout.\nThe foreman, or head of the hauling crew (Wilkinson), however, stated in his cross-examination that there were always children on Higgins Street when they went down there in good weather, all the way down Higgins, though he couldn\u2019t say he noticed them particularly at the corner of Ellen Street\u2014that \u201cthere are always children playing on Higgins Ave,\u201d and that he had noticed that in the ordinary course of his duties as a foreman there.\nAnother member of the hauling crew, Boardman, said he had seen children on Higgins Avenue at different times playing there. When asked if he had seen them playing on the corner, he replied that he wouldn\u2019t say on the corner, anywhere along the whole street\u2014he didn\u2019t want to specify Ellen any more than any other street, but he reiterated that he had seen them all along Higgins Avenue while he was working there as a switchman.\nBeatty, the defendant\u2019s general yardmaster, when asked as to Messier\u2019s duty, said that his principal duty was to protect the east end of the drag, but that if he was standing there and saw children in danger he was supposed to warn them and he admitted that he had seen children playing on Higgins Avenue.\nQ. At the corner of Ellen and Higgins?\nA. Well, in all the district.\nQ. There are a lot of children in the district, aren\u2019t there?\nA. No more than normal, I imagine.\nIn addition to the evidence of Messier another witness for the plaintiff, Voss, swore that Messier used to chase the kids off the box cars.\nHobson, Jr., another witness for the plaintiff, who was 17 years old at the time of the trial and 15 at the time of the accident, who actually saw the infant plaintiff fall from the ladder, testified that Messier used to tell them, when the ball would go over on the other side of the tracks, whether it was o.k. to go across and get it, and that he usually told them whether the train was going out or not and say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo,\u201d and that if the train was stationary they climbed up the ladder steps on the couplings and climbed down the other side; that he had done that himself and that he had seen other boys do it. Hobson\u2019s father also gave evidence to the effect that children all around the district generally played in that neighbourhood around by the vacant lot on Ellen Street, especially in the evenings when the cars of the defendant were on the Higgins Avenue track; that he had often seen children playing on the top of the loading platform and along by the warehouse where the drag comes in on Ellen Street between Henry and Higgins and on Higgins Avenue itself; that lots of times he had seen from 30 to 50 children.\nAnother witness, Stevens, who was employed as night man in a warehouse which extends to Higgins Avenue on Ellen Street, also swore that children were in the habit of playing in and around the corner of Ellen and Higgins in large numbers in the summer; that he had seen them playing on the loading platform, rolling tires, balls and rolling hoops down the slope over towards the train; that he had seen the ball knocked over the fence of the vacant lot and roll under the cars and seen both boys and girls go under the cars; that that was a frequent occurrence, \u201ctwo or three times an evening.\u201d\nThe boy, Hobson, was riding a bicycle towards the top of Ellen Street when he saw the infant plaintiff fall from the ladder of the box car. Though at the outset of his testimony, when asked where he first saw the little boy on the day in question, he answered \u201cOn Ellen Street,\u201d and that he (Hobson) was riding a bicycle at the time, it is clear from his evidence that before he saw the boy on the ladder of the box car he had seen him that night on Higgins Avenue and he distinctly swore that he was then playing with some other boys around the freight cars.\nI cannot avoid the conclusion upon the whole record that the defendant through its servants and agents must be charged with knowledge that there was a special danger to young children, more particularly in the immediate vicinity of the corner of Ellen Street, not only in the shunting of cars during the assembling operations by the shed crew on this railway track, but in the starting of the completed train by the hauling crew. The railway cars of the first or second cut, it seems, were usually standing upon the railway track directly opposite the top of Ellen Street, where it was the habit of children to gather for their after supper play\u2014some in the ball field, some on the loading platform, and some on the street and boulevard\u2014and were clearly an object of attraction to the younger children, who doubtless had seen the older ones climb the car ladders. If the defendant\u2019s servants and agents in charge of these operations did not actually know of these conditions and of that danger, they ought to have known of them, and that one or more of these children were more than likely to be about or upon the cars when the train was started. This was the real basis of the action, so that, as already indicated, the vital question is: Did the defendant take reasonable and proper precautions to guard against this obvious danger to such children as the infant plaintiff, who was too young to see it himself.\nIt is quite apparent from his reasons for judgment that the learned trial judge\u2019s finding that the defendant did all that was reasonable to see that all was clear when the train started was based upon a consideration of the conduct of the infant plaintiff rather than upon a consideration of whether on the whole evidence the railway took adequate precautions to guard against such a thing as happened. His Lordship says the little fellow \u201cran out a few moments before the train started and evaded being seen by the trainmen or the constable who had both passed the car to which he ran a short time before,\u201d and immediately adds:\u2014\nHow could the defendant guard against such conduct? The little lad told what happened without being sworn. For what it is worth he said that he and two companions ran across the street to the cars\u2014that the other two boys saw the engine and ran on. He did not see the engine, crawled up the side ladder and went to the back ladder when the train started. He fell and his foot was cut off. This would all happen in a few seconds. They must have run out just when Boardman (one of the two trainmen referred to) was giving his signal and when his back was turned. If Boardman is correct as to where he was, he must have been very few car lengths from the very car the boy climbed. Crick (the constable) says he saw a boy fall while running, but it must have been one of the other boys. He was fifteen car lengths east. He did not happen to look during the few seconds it took these boys to cross Higgins avenue to the cars.\nOn the facts it is clear that the plaintiff was a trespasser.\nIt will be seen that these findings are for the most part inferences drawn from undisputed facts and are therefore quite open to review by a Court of Appeal.\nIf Boardman was at all concerned in seeing \u201cthat all was clear (in the sense that no young children were endangered) when the train started,\u201d and was standing opposite Ellen street just west of the switch, as the evidence clearly shews he must have been, it seems to me to be an altogether remarkable thing that he could have failed to see three children run across the street to the cars and one of them climb the lower rungs of the side ladder behind him and then crawl around the corner to get on the back one, without any lack of vigilance or failure of duty on his part. Why should he before the train started be looking away from the place of greatest danger at the critical moment? When the defendant\u2019s counsel in his examination-in-chief asked Boardman if there were any children near the cars when he was standing there, his answer was: \u201cNot that I noticed particularly; there might have been some up on the sidewalk or the boulevard.\u201d The truth is that Boardman was not there for the purpose of being on the lookout for children, but simply for the purpose of giving his O.K. signal after the train started to Wilkinson, the other yardman who was standing near the engine, that the cars were all coming, as he explained to the defendant\u2019s counsel. It is true that before he took up his position for this purpose he had passed the car to which the boy ran, and in fact walked down Higgins avenue the full length of the drag, but this was not for the purpose of seeing that no young children were on or about the cars either, but for the purpose of making a list of all the car destinations. This work must have taken more than a few minutes. After completing his list he walked back to the point west of the switch from which he gave his signal to Wilkinson. He was not asked if on his way back to this position he looked to see if any children were on or about any of the cars. No doubt, however, if he had seen the infant plaintiff on the side ladder he would have said so.\nWilkinson, the other trainman, who is said to have passed the car, from which the plaintiff fell, a short time before, does not agree with Boardman that he accompanied the latter on his walk east along the whole length of the drag. He says he left Boardman at a point about 12 car lengths from the rear of the train, but was not at all sure as to whether it might not have been 13 or 14 car lengths. Apparently it depended in his mind upon how many cars were included in the first cut of cars which had been placed on the lead by the shed crew, for he said they went down together to that point to see that the first cut was coupled. It was clearly not for the purpose of seeing if any children were on or about the train when it started, and would have been of no avail in this regard, for he thought it was 15 minutes before the train pulled out that he left Boardman and walked back to take up his signalling position near the engine. It was Wilkinson who said that there were always children playing on Higgins avenue, but notwithstanding this he stated he never got any instructions about children.\nAs regards Crick, who is described as a constable, the record shews that he went on duty at the lead at 7.15 p.m.\u2014about an hour before the train pulled out\u2014for the purpose of taking the seal records of all the cars, and that he walked along both sides of the full length of the train for that purpose, first along the north side from east to west and then the south side from west to east. It is true he says, he kept watch while doing so to see there was nobody around the train, but his principal duty was to take the seal records on all the cars, which obviously would take considerable time, and not enable him to properly perform the duty of seeing that \u201call was clear,\u201d so far as children were concerned, \u201cwhen the train started,\u201d for the train was a train of 55 cars and stretched along the track for not far short of half a mile.\nCrick himself in his examination-in-chief testified that when he got to the east end car and was reading that seal record the train started to move and that he immediately turned round and saw three small boys run across Higgins avenue from Ellen street towards the train; that they turned west and ran alongside of the train; that he saw one boy fall; that he (Crick) immediately proceeded to catch up to him, and after walking a short distance alongside the train got on the moving train, and when within about 200 feet of where the boy fell, saw another boy come across from Ellen street and pick the lad up. In cross-examination he first said he was walking east towards the end of the train when it started, but immediately afterwards said he was \u201cat the east end car of the train\u201d at the time. Whether, however, he was walking towards the east end or had reached the end car and was standing there, he afterwards distinctly affirmed that when the train started to move he was about 150 feet west of the west dine of Lizzie street with his back to the engine, looking east. The learned trial Judge did not accept that portion of Crick\u2019s evidence, which clearly pointed to the infant plaintiff as the boy who fell while running west alongside the train, but he finds that Crick was 15 car lengths east (of where Boardman was standing to give his O.K. signal to Wilkinson) when he says he saw the boys running. \u201cHe did not happen,\u201d His Lordship adds, \u201cto look during the few seconds it took these boys to cross Higgins avenue to the cars.\u201d So that if it was Crick\u2019s duty to see that all was clear, so far as children were concerned, when the train started, there was a clear failure of duty on his part also. He was looking east from the rear car 450 feet from Ellen street with his back to the engine at the critical time.\nThat both Boardman and Crick should have had their backs turned to the danger point at the critical moment, if it was the duty of either to see that no children were on or about the cars when the train started, is surely a most extraordinary coincidence. The fair inference from it is that neither regarded it as his duty to see that all was clear and that no children would be endangered when the train started to move.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge that the defendant did all that was reasonable to see that all was clear when the train started could only be justified on the assumption that it owed no duty to guard young children against such an obvious danger, for it was not pretended that there was anyone else than Boardman, who could have seen the children run to the train from the vicinity of the Ellen Street corner, and warn them when it was about to start, and Crick, who, as stated, was 450 feet east of that point, was too far away to warn them, and was actually looking east when the train started to move west. No other precautions of any kind were taken by the railway to guard against such a danger.\nMessier, who appears to have been the only employee of the defendant whose real duty was to watch for children and others and warn them of the movement of cars on the lead during the operations of the assembling crew, was not in the locality at all. He went on duty with the shed crew and left when that crew finished their work. Beatty, the general yardmaster, said that Messier did not usually stay on Higgins Avenue until the train pulled out; that as long as the shed crew was through he was through. Messier himself in his cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel said that when the drag was assembled his duties were through. Had he been stationed at the corner of Ellen Street, where he stated that he usually stationed himself, he would surely have seen the infant plaintiff run across with the two or three other boys and climb the ladder and this unfortunate accident would not have occurred.\nIt seems to me that ordinary prudence should have suggested to the defendant\u2019s terminal officers the necessity of keeping Messier or some other watchman, specially charged with the duty of looking out for children, from the time the hauling crew took over the drag until it was moved safely off the street, and that it was in no sense sufficient for the railway to rely for the avoidance of such a thing as happened that night, and as might have happened at any moment while the little boys were about the street, upon its ordinary hauling crew and a man like Crick, who was engaged at the very time the train started, according to his own evidence, in examining the seal of the last car 15 car lengths east of the most obvious point of danger with his back to the engine.\nAs regards the learned trial judge\u2019s finding that the infant plaintiff ran out a few moments before the train started and \u201cevaded\u201d being seen by the trainmen, I cannot think it possible that a boy of but 4\u00bd years could have had any thought of taking advantage of Boardman\u2019s lack of vigilance when he ran across the street with his three companions and climbed the ladder. The boy himself in his unsworn statement, to which His Lordship refers \u201cfor what it is worth,\u201d says that when he and the other boys ran over to the train he, before climbing the first few rungs of the side ladder and pulling himself around the corner to the end ladder, sat down on the first seat (of the ladder) and then said to his companions, \u201cLet us climb,\u201d and they said, \u201cNo,\u201d but that he went up the ladder and that the other boys then saw the engine coming and ran away. If this statement is to be relied upon at all and the boy had any appreciation of the surroundings, it would surely indicate that he could not possibly have had any idea of \u201cevading\u201d Boardman. In any event he was merely indulging the natural instinct of children to play and amuse themselves, which was the cause of the special danger against which it was the defendant\u2019s duty to guard.\nIt was strongly contended in behalf of the defendant that it was not reasonably practicable for the railway to guard against such a danger, inasmuch as to do so effectually would require it to employ special watchmen all along the street when the trains were about to start, and such a requirement would be an intolerable and unreasonable burden to impose upon the railway. I quite agree that it would be unreasonable to insist upon the employment of special watchmen \u201call along the street,\u201d if that means at every car along the lead, and that the only duty resting upon the defendant towards the children was to take reasonably adequate precautions to gaurd them from the danger involved in the shunting of cars and the starting of trains in such a locality. I do not agree, however, that there was no more danger at the corner of Ellen Street than elsewhere, and that there was consequently no more obligation on the part of the defendant to provide a watchman there than at any other point along the track. The weight of the evidence is decidedly to the contrary. The testimony of Messier, who had acted as a special watchman for the defendant for two years during the assembling of the oars on the lead, and which was not contradicted in any of its essential features, conclusively proves that he himself recognized the fact that there was a special danger at that corner, apart altogether from that of the other witnesses, which I have above summarized. I have already called attention to the fact that there were but two north and south streets west of Lizzie Street, which ended on Higgins Avenue. This duty, it seems to me, could properly have been discharged by the employment of one or two special watchmen at the most to patrol the really dangerous sections when the hauling crews took over the assembled drags. It was, in my opinion, not adequately discharged by relying wholly upon the yardmen of the ordinary hauling crew, supplemented only by a constable, charged with the duty of examining and recording the car seal records, and who was most likely in his fulfilment of that duty to be at the extreme end of the drag when the train started, with his mind centred on his particular work. One or two such special watchmen as I have suggested would have been required for a period of not more than half an hour before the train moved off the street.\nI entirely agree with the majority judgment of the Appeal Court on the issue of liability, and as there can be no objection to the quantum of damages, which the Court itself assessed on undisputed testimony in order to avoid the expense of a new trial for the assessment of damages only in such a case, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal as against infant respondent allowed, with costs if asked for.

Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Corporation of the City of Toronto (Defendant) Respondent.\n1936: May 6, 27.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Business assessment\u2014Clause (cc) (added in 1933, c. 2, s. 2) of s. 9 (1) of Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238\u2014\u201cDistribution premises\u201d for goods supplied to a chain of retail stores\u2014Submission of questions under s. 84 of said Act.\nClause (cc) (added in 1933, c. 2, s. 2) of s. 9 (1) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, imposes upon \u201cevery person carrying on the business of selling or distributing goods * * * to a chain of more than five retail stores or shops in Ontario\u201d a business assessment for a sum equal to 75 per cent. of the assessed value of the land occupied or used \u201cin such business for a distribution premises, storage or warehouse\u201d for such goods, or for an office used in connection with the business. Appellant company owned a chain of retail grocery stores and had in Toronto, Ontario, a large warehouse building in which it had its general administrative offices, and in which it stored goods until required by its stores, and from which it distributed goods by trucks to its stores. In respect of this building (and the land on which it stood) appellant was assessed under said clause (cc); this assessment was not in dispute. In 1934 appellant acquired land and built thereon, across a street from the said older building (and not connected with it except by a small pipe tunnel under the street for housing pipes and wires for conveying steam heat, water, electricity and gas to the new building), a building used, (1) for a garage for housing appellant\u2019s trucks, (2) as a repair shop for its trucks, and for servicing its cars used by its store supervisors in making inspections, and (3) as a carpenter, paint and repair shop for repairing shelving and other fixtures in the retail stores and doing repairs to said stores. In respect of this building also (and the land on which it stood), and as a parcel in itself, appellant was assessed by the City of Toronto under said clause (cc); and the question in dispute, on, a case stated by a County Court Judge under s. 84 of said Assessment Act, was whether appellant was (in respect of the latter building and land) properly so assessed.\nHeld: Appellant was not assessable under said clause (cc) in respect of the building and land secondly above described. It could not be said that the land was occupied or used by appellant in its business for distributive purposes in the sense that the two buildings taken together were occupied and used in its business for the storage and distribution of its goods. The occupation or use of the particular land assessed must be looked at; and the new building could not be said to come plainly within the words \u201cdistribution premises\u201d within clause (cc), strictly read.\nThe contention that the finding in the courts below that the land and building in question were used as distribution premises was a finding of fact which should not be interfered with, was rejected. The question raised was the proper construction of the statute (Sedgwick v. Watney, [1931] A.C. 446).\nThe only questions that may be submitted by a County Court Judge under said s. 84 are questions directly affecting the particular assessment in appeal before him. It was not proper in the present case to submit further a general question whether the premises were assessable for business tax under any of the provisions of the Act.\nAPPEAL by Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing (Henderson J.A. dissenting) its appeal from the judgment of His Honour, Judge Lee, of the County Court of the County of York, confirming a certain assessment by the City of Toronto (respondent) of the appellant company for business assessment. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was by way of stated case pursuant to s. 84 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, and amendments. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed, with costs throughout.\nG.A. Urquhart K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.P. Kent and W.G. Angus for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellant, Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited, carries on business in the province of Ontario as retail grocers and owns a chain of more than five retail stores or shops in the province of Ontario. The head office of the company is in the city of Toronto.\nIn 1928 the appellant constructed a large warehouse building in the city of Toronto on lands bounded on the south by Fleet street, on the west by Bathurst street, on the north by Housey street and on the east by a railway siding.\nThe following are the uses to which this building has been and is put:\n(a) The housing of the general administrative offices of the company.\n(b) The storage of surplus goods, wares and merchandise sold in the company\u2019s retail stores until such times as they are required by these stores.\n(c) The manufacture of candies, cakes and sundry other articles and the cutting of meats, etc.\n(d) The loading of trucks in runways on the ground floor of said building.\n(e) The distribution of goods, wares and merchandise by the said trucks from this building to the various retail stores operated by the appellant according to the needs of the stores. No selling by retail is done at this building.\nNothing is charged directly to the stores for the service of distribution from this building to the stores, but the goods are sent out to the various stores from this building duly priced for sale in the said stores.\nIn the year 1934 the appellant acquired certain land bounded on the south by Housey street, on the west by Bathurst street and on the north and east by a travelled road, and constructed a large new building which is used solely for the following purposes:\n(1) As a garage for housing appellant\u2019s trucks.\n(2) As a repair shop for repairing appellant\u2019s trucks and for the service of appellant\u2019s cars used by the supervisors of the various retail stores in making their inspections. The appellant does not carry on a garage business. (3) As a carpenter, paint and repair shop solely for the purpose of servicing the shelving and other fixtures in the retail stores and doing repairs to the said stores.\nThere is no connection between the two buildings except by a small pipe tunnel which passes under Housey street for housing pipes and wires for conveying steam heat, water, electricity and gas from the first mentioned to the last mentioned building.\nThe appellant does not carry on a trucking business, its trucks being used only to distribute the appellant\u2019s own goods, wares and merchandise to the retail stores of the appellant.\nThese are the facts stated by a Judge of the County Court of the County of York pursuant to the provisions of sec. 84 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 238, and amendments thereto, on an appeal by the appellant to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment of the County Judge who confirmed an assessment by the respondent for \u201cbusiness assessment\u201d on the secondly described land and building. The question in appeal turns upon the proper construction to be put upon an amendment in 1933 to the Assessment Act, the amendment being sec. 2 of chapter 2 of the Statutes of 1933, which amended subsection (1) of section 9 of the Assessment Act by adding thereto the following clause (cc):\n(cc) Every person carrying on the business of selling or distributing goods, wares and merchandise to a chain of more than five retail stores or shops in Ontario, directly or indirectly, owned, controlled or operated by him, for a sum equal to seventy-five per centum of the assessed value of the land occupied or used by him in such business for a distribution premises, storage or warehouse for such goods, wares and merchandise, or for an office used in connection with the said business.\nUntil the 1933 amendment, the appellant was liable for business assessment as a retail merchant under clause (h) of subsection (1) of section 9 for a sum equal to 25 per centum of the assessed value of the land occupied or used by it for the purpose of its business. The amendment of 1933, (cc), increased the rate of assessment from 25 to 75 per centum on every person, such as the appellant, carrying on the business of selling or distributing goods, wares and merchandise to a chain of more than five retail stores or shops in Ontario, directly or indirectly, owned, controlled or operated by such person, but the assessment at the increased rate applies only to \u201cthe assessed value of the land occupied or used by him in such business for a distribution premises, storage or warehouse for such goods, wares and merchandise, or for an office used in connection with the said business.\u201d\nSince the amendment of 1933 the firstly described building and the land on which it stands have been assessed for business tax for a sum equal to 75 per centum of their assessed value, and this assessment is not in dispute. The secondly described building and the land on which it stands were similarly assessed for business tax for 1936. From the latter assessment, the appellant appealed to the Court of Revision which dismissed the appeal. From that decision an appeal was taken by the appellant to the County Judge, and he dismissed that appeal. The appellant having requested the County Judge on the hearing of the said appeal to make a note of the questions of law to be considered and to state them in the form of a special case for a Divisional Court pursuant to the provisions of sec. 84 of the Assessment Act, the facts above set forth were so stated for the consideration of a higher court. The learned County Judge on the facts was of opinion that the secondly described building and the land on which it stands came within the 1933 amendment. Upon further appeal by the appellant, on the stated case, the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Latchford, C.J.A., and Riddell, J.A.; Henderson, J.A., dissenting) dismissed the appeal. From this judgment the appellant appealed to this Court.\nThe sole question therefore is, whether or not the land and building used by the appellant for a garage and paint shop come within the words \u201cdistribution premises\u201d in the amending statute. It is not suggested, of course, that the land or building was used for \u201cstorage\u201d or \u201cwarehouse\u201d for the appellant\u2019s \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise\u201d or for \u201can office\u201d in connection with its business, but it is contended by counsel for the respondent that the land is occupied or used by the appellant in its business for distributive purposes in the sense that the two adjacent buildings taken together are in fact occupied and used by the appellant in its business for the storage and distribution of its goods, wares and merchandise. The two parcels of land are separately assessed and the particular assessment with which we are concerned must itself be justified by the statute. It is plain that the words of the statute \u201cpoint at some kind of special use of the premises,\u201d to use the words of Viscount Dunedin in the House of Lords in Sedgwick v. Watney[1], and that the occupation or use of the particular land subjected to this special assessment must be looked at. Without attempting any definition as to what are and what are not \u201cdistribution premises\u201d within the statute, I do not think that the garage and paint shop in the separate though adjacent building to the warehouse or storage building of the owner can be said to come plainly within the language strictly read. The use of precise words such as \u201cstorage,\u201d \u201cwarehouse\u201d and \u201coffice\u201d in the section entitles the appellant to the narrower construction.\nIt is argued that, the courts below having reached the conclusion that the land and building were used as distribution premises, this is a finding of fact with which we ought not to interfere. But it is a question of law that is made the subject-matter of the right of appeal from the County Judge upon a stated case and we are bound to determine upon the proper construction of the amendment whether or not, upon the facts stated, the land and building are caught by the increased rate of assessment. Questions of this sort are constantly before the House of Lords on taxing statutes and are dealt with as raising the proper construction to be put upon the language of the statutes. For instance, in Sedgwick v. Watney[2] above mentioned the question was whether a bottling store occupied by brewers in which beer brewed by them elsewhere was matured, carbonated, filtered and bottled, and from which, after the bottles had been corked and labelled, it was distributed to the trade, was \u201can industrial hereditament\u201d under sec. 3 of The Rating and Valuation Apportionment Act, 1928, or was primarily occupied and used for the purposes of \u201cdistributive wholesale business\u201d within an exception in the Act. The rating authority had put the premises on the special list as an industrial hereditament and their decision was upheld by the Assessment Committee. Appeal being taken to Quarter Sessions, a special case was stated to the King\u2019s Bench Division which reversed the court below. From that judgment, appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal which reversed the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench Division and restored the judgment of the Assessment Committee. The House of Lords then considered the matter and the judgment of the House was read by Viscount Dunedin, pp. 460-465, and while it said that \u201cafter all, the question is an individual one as to each particular hereditament,\u201d the appeal was determined upon the proper construction to be put upon the words of the statute.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and the first question submitted by the County Judge upon the stated case,\nWas I correct in holding that the appellant in respect of the land and building above mentioned situate on the northeast corner of Housey and Bathurst streets, Toronto, was properly assessable for business tax for a sum equal to seventy-five per centum of the assessed value thereof?\nshould be answered in the negative.\nThe County Judge submitted a further question:\nIf the above question is answered in the negative, are the said premises assessable for business tax under any of the provisions of the Assessment Act?\nThis second question was not discussed before us and we assume that the parties did not think that it raised any difficulty once the first question was answered. But the question was not in any event a proper one, in that the particular assessment before the court was founded and supported solely upon the amending clause (cc), and the only questions permitted a County Judge to submit by way of a stated case under sec. 84 of the Assessment Act are questions directly affecting the particular assessment in appeal before him, and the provision of the statute cannot be used generally for obtaining the court\u2019s opinion as to whether an assessment under some other section of the statute could properly be made.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Urquhart & Urquhart.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.M. Colquhoun.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 446, at 463.\n[2] [1931] A.C. 446.\n",

Lamont J. died before delivery of judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA, BRITISH COLUMBIA ADMIRALTY DISTRICT\nEvidence\u2014Shipping\u2014Crown claiming forfeiture of ship, under s. 67 (2) of Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (Imp.), because of alleged false statement of citizenship in declaration of ownership\u2014Authenticated photostatic copy of certificate of naturalization in foreign country to person of same name as person making declaration of ownership\u2014Inadmissibility of comparison of handwriting of citizen\u2019s signature on said copy of certificate of naturalization with that of signature on declaration of ownership, to prove identity\u2014Failure to object to admissibility at trial.\nThe Crown claimed forfeiture of a ship, under s. 67 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, (Imp.), alleging that its registered owner, one Manuel Purdy, wilfully made a false declaration touching his qualification to be registered as owner, by falsely declaring that he was a British subject. The declaration in question was contained in his declaration of ownership upon his application for registration of the ship in his name as owner, in March, 1933. His signature to this was duly proved. There was also put in evidence an authenticated photostatic copy of a naturalization certificate issued on November 27, 1926, by which \u201cManuel Purdy,\u201d \u201c who previous to his naturalization was a subject of England,\u201d became a citizen of the United States. The signature \u201cManuel Purdy\u201d appeared on this certificate, and evidence was given of the practice to have the signature of the person to whom the certificate relates put upon it. The Crown relied on a comparison of the handwriting of this signature with that of the signature to the said declaration of ownership, along with the identity of names, to prove identity.\nHeld: Such a comparison of handwriting was inadmissible. The authenticated copy of the naturalization certificate was good evidence of the contents of the original document; and the proper inference was that the signature \u201cManuel Purdy\u201d appearing\u2019 on the certificate was that of the person to whom the certificate was granted. But the rules by which, at common law or by statute, a record may be proved by exemplification or by the certificate of the person having the custody of the record, where in the nature of things the original cannot be produced, do not contemplate the use of such document for the purpose of establishing the character of the handwriting on the original document. The court cannot receive for the purpose of comparison of handwriting a copy, photographic or other, of alleged specimens of handwriting upon proof by official certificate alone. The court could not examine the photostatic copy of the certificate of naturalization in question for any other purpose than that of ascertaining the contents of the original. It was not shewn, therefore, that the Manuel Purdy who in 1926 was admitted a citizen of the United States was the same person who in 1933 made the said declaration of ownership and became registered as owner of the ship. Identity of names alone was not satisfactory evidence upon which to decree a forfeiture (which postulates an offence) under said s. 67 (2).\nThe contention that, as the above particular objection to the comparison of handwriting to shew identity was not taken when the evidence was offered and received, effect should not be given to it now, was rejected (Jacker v. International Cable Co., 5 T.L.R. 13). Nothing occurred at the trial (such as did occur, e.g., in Bradshaw v. Widdring-ton; see 86 L.T. 726, at 732) which precluded insistence on the objection now. Also, the document being admissible to establish a necessary part of the Crown\u2019s case, and having been admitted, it was not so much a question of the admissibility of a piece of evidence as of the manner in which evidence admissible and admitted could properly be applied. The denial of admissibility of such comparison was a proposition of law to which the court could not refuse to give effect on this appeal; because the Crown by this appeal was asking the court to declare a forfeiture, and the court must consider whether there was a proper foundation in the evidence for such a declaration.\nJudgment of Martin, D. J. Adm., [1936] Ex. C.R. 92, in favour of an unregistered transferee of a registered mortgage of the ship, as against the Crown, affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Martin, District Judge in Admiralty for the British Columbia Admiralty District[1].\nThe Crown claimed forfeiture of the ship Emma K by reason of an alleged false declaration in a declaration of ownership made on March 23, 1933. At the trial the present respondent Barrett was given leave to intervene as being a person interested as the unregistered transferee of a registered mortgage, and judgment was given in his favour1 for the sum standing in court to the credit of the cause as the balance of the proceeds of sale of the ship, to be applied in reduction of the mortgage. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nD. K. MacTavish for the respondent Barrett.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ.* was delivered by Duff C.J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin[2], the local Judge in Admiralty for the Admiralty District of British Columbia, who, in proceedings taken under section. 76 of the Merchant Shipping Act charging an offence under section 67 (2) of the same Act, adjudged the ship forfeited, but held that the sum of $2,689.34 standing in court, a balance of the proceeds of the sale of the ship, should be paid out to John Barrett, intervener, who claimed as mortgagee. The learned judge held that forfeiture under section 67 (2) does not operate until condemnation and that the interest of the mortgagee was not affected by it.\nIn the view I take, it will be unnecessary to consider the point discussed in the very able judgment of the learned judge in admiralty.\nPrior to the 22nd of March, 1933, the ship Emma K was registered in the name of Edward Lipsett Limited. By virtue of a bill of sale dated on that day it was sold to one Manuel Purdy who became the registered owner on or about that date. On the 18th day of April, 1934, an action was instituted by certain seamen for wages. In that action the ship was arrested and, on the 12th of June, 1934, was sold pursuant to a judgment in admiralty to satisfy the wage claims and costs of the crew. The Judge in Admiralty directed that the balance of the monies in court, after payment of these claims, should remain in court to the credit of any actions that were pending on the date of the order, and these included the present action. At the trial of the action, Barrett obtained leave to intervene as defendant as the unregistered transferee of a mortgage in favour of one Allender, dated the 23rd of March, 1933. The claim of forfeiture is in the endorsement on the writ stated in the following words:\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant ship is for the confiscation thereof to the purposes of His Majesty the King for that the registered owner thereof, one Manuel Purdy, did wilfully make a false declaration touching his qualification to be registered as such owner by falsely declaring that he was a British subject, whereas in truth and in fact he is and at all material times has been a citizen of the United States of America, contrary to Section 67, Subsection (2) of the \u201cMerchant Shipping Act, 1894.\u201d\nAlternatively the plaintiff says that being a citizen of a foreign country the said Manuel Purdy did unlawfully cause the ship Emma K to fly the British flag and assume a British character contrary to Section 69 of the \u201cMerchant Shipping Act, 1894.\u201d\nThe learned judge found that the alternative claim was not established; and we agree with his views upon this branch of the case.\nIn support of the principal claim, the declaration of ownership made upon the application of Manuel Purdy for registration of the ship in his name as owner was produced from the Victoria registry and the signature of Manuel Purdy was proved by one of the employees in the registry who said that the document was signed in his presence. The declaration contains this statement:\nI am a natural-born British subject, born at White Bay, Newfoundland, * * * and have never taken the oath of allegiance to any foreign sovereign or state, or have otherwise become a citizen or subject of a foreign state.\nThe claim for forfeiture is based upon the allegation that this statement is false and that the declaration was a \u201cwilfully * * * false declaration\u201d within the meaning of section 67 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act which provides:\n(2) If any person wilfully makes a false declaration touching the qualification of himself or of any other person or of any corporation to own a British ship or any share therein, he shall for each offence be guilty of a misdemeanor, and that ship or share shall be subject to forfeiture under this Act, to the extent of the interest therein of the declarant, and also, unless it is proved that the declaration was made without authority, of any person or corporation on behalf of whom the declaration is made.\nSection 1 of the Merchant Shipping Act enacts that a natural born British subject who has become a citizen or subject of a foreign state shall not be qualified to be the owner of a British ship, subject to a qualification not presently material; and, consequently, the statement quoted from the declaration was obviously a statement \u201ctouching the qualification of\u201d the declarant to be the owner of a British ship.\nEvidence was adduced to show\u2014to this evidence I shall particularly refer in a moment\u2014that Manuel Purdy had, on the 27th of November, 1926, been admitted a citizen of the United States of America pursuant to law. Obviously, if the Manuel Purdy who became the registered owner of the Emma K, and, for the purpose of becoming registered as owner, signed and made the declaration of ownership above mentioned, was the Manuel Purdy who was admitted as an American citizen in 1926, he was not qualified to be the owner of a British ship and the statement quoted from the declaration of ownership was contrary to the fact.\nThe claim for forfeiture necessarily rests upon proof by the Crown that, in making this statement, Manuel Purdy \u201cwilfully made a false declaration\u201d touching the qualification of himself to own a British ship. The point to be considered is whether or not the Manuel Purdy who, in 1926, was admitted a citizen of the United States was the same Manuel Purdy who made the declaration of ownership in 1933, and became registered as owner of the ship in 1933. Two circumstances are relied upon: first, identity of names, and second, identity of handwriting.\nFor the purpose of establishing this identity, a photostatic copy of the naturalization certificate issued to Manuel Purdy on the 27th November, 1926, is produced, and that copy is authenticated, first of all by the seal of the United States Court of Alaska, Division No. 1, attested by the Clerk of that Court; and, secondly, by the certificate of the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Labor under the seal of the Department of Labor of the United States of America, which seal in turn is attested by the certificate of the Acting Secretary of State for the United States of America and the Chief Clerk of the Department of State. The certificate of naturalization is as follows:\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nNo. 2303964\ncertificate op (Coat of Arms) naturalization\nPetition, Volume VIII, Number 992-J.\nDescription of holder: Age, 33 years; height, 6 feet \u00bd inch; color, white; complexion, fair; color of eyes, hazel; color of hair, dark brown; visible distinguishing marks, none.\n(Note:\u2014After September 22, 1922, husband\u2019s naturalization does not make wife a citizen.)\nUnited States of America\nTerritory of Alaska.\nss. Manuel Purdy\nSignature of Holder.\nBe it remembered, that Manuel Purdy, then residing at number Street, City of Juneau, Territory of Alaska, who previous to his naturalization was a subject of England, having applied to be admitted a citizen of the United States of America pursuant to law, and at a regular term of the U.S. Court of Alaska, Div. No. 1, held\u2019 at Juneau, on the 27th day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-six, the court having found that the petitioner intends to reside permanently in the United States, and that he had in all respects complied with the Naturalization Laws of the United States, and that he was entitled to be so admitted, it was thereupon ordered by the said court that he be admitted as a citizen of the United States of America.\nIn testimony whereof the seal of said court is hereunto affixed on the 27th day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-six, and of our Independence the one hundred and fifty-first.\nJOHN H. DUNN, Clerk\nU.S. District Court, Div. No. 1.\n(Seal) By \u2018Alta C. Purpus,\u2019\nDeputy (Official character of attestor)\nThe evidence sufficiently proves that one Manuel Purdy became a citizen of the United States by naturalization on the date mentioned. Evidence was also given to the effect that the practice is that the signature of the person to whom the certificate of naturalization relates shall be put upon the certificate; and the proper inference is that the signature \u201cManuel Purdy\u201d appearing on the certificate is the signature of the Manuel Purdy to whom the certificate was granted. The Crown relies upon a comparison of the handwriting of this signature with the handwriting of the signature of Manuel Purdy attached to the declaration of ownership. The question is: Is such a comparison of handwriting admissible?\nSection 8 of the Canada Evidence Act is in these words:\n8. Comparison of a disputed writing with any writing proved to the satisfaction of the court to be genuine shall be permitted to be made by witnesses; and such writings and the evidence of witnesses respecting the same, may be submitted to the court and jury as evidence of the genuineness or otherwise of the writing in dispute.\nThere is high authority to the effect that comparison under the statutory rule involves the production of both the disputed and the genuine handwriting. In McCullough v. Munn[3] the view of Palles C.B., that a photographic copy of the alleged genuine handwriting was not admissible for the purpose of comparison under the rule, was accepted by virtually all the Irish judges including Fitzgibbon L.J. and Holmes L.J. Whether or not that principle is applicable in this case it is not necessary to decide.\nThe certificate of naturalization was pertinent evidence to establish the offence charged under section 67 (2) and, probably, if the original document had been before the court, it would have been competent to the court, without the aid of the statutory rule, to enter upon a comparison of the handwriting in the two signatures for the purpose of dealing with the question of identity. It is unnecessary to decide the question whether, if a photographic copy, proved in the ordinary way by the evidence of the photographer who had made the photograph and could inform the court upon the preliminary question as to the accuracy of his methods and results, had been before the court, it would have been competent to the court to inspect the copy of the signature so proved for the purpose of comparison with the signature attached to the declaration of ownership. What we have before us is something entirely different. It is a certified copy, or, if you will, an exemplification of proceedings in the United States Court in Alaska. This document is perfectly good evidence of the contents of the original document; but the rules by which at common law or by statute a record may be proved by exemplification or by the certificate of the person having the custody of the record, where in the nature of things the original cannot be produced, do not contemplate the use of such document for the purpose of establishing the character of the handwriting on the original document. I know of no principle and of no authority which could justify a court in receiving for the purpose of comparison of handwriting a copy, photographic or other, of alleged specimens of handwriting upon proof by official certificate alone. In my opinion, it is not competent for the court to examine the photostatic copy of the certificate of naturalization now before us for any other purpose than that of ascertaining the contents of the original certificate.\nAs evidence of identity there remains the identity of names which, in my opinion, is not satisfactory evidence upon which to decree a forfeiture (which postulates an offence) under section 67 (2).\nThe Crown argues that, as this particular objection to the evidence was not presented when the evidence was offered and received, effect cannot be given to it now. This argument is answered by J acker v. International Cable Company[4], a decision which has been applied in this court more than once. There may, of course, be cases in which the failure to take an objection precludes the party from insisting on that objection on appeal, for example; if, by reason of the fact that evidence was not objected to, the party refrains from offering other evidence which he has at his command which would be unobjectionable, the right to object to the evidence received may be lost. An instance of that occurred in Bradshaw v. Widdrington[5] where, as stated in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls,\n* * * it seems to me that Mr. Terrell is really not in a position to contest before us, as a matter of strict law, whether those accounts are admissible or not, because at the trial Mr. Astbury was there with the evidence which would have told us the precise conditions under which those accounts came into existence. Owing to what passed at the time between him and Mr. Terrell in the presence of the judge in the court below, that evidence was not called. * * * If those objections had been pressed, Mr. Astbury had witnesses who were prepared to deal with them.\nNothing occurred at the trial in the present case which precludes the respondent from insisting on the objection now.\nIt should be observed, however, that the document, the photostatic copy of the certificate of naturalization, was plainly admissible for the purpose of establishing a necessary part of the case of the Crown, viz., that Manuel Purdy had become a citizen of the United States of America. The document being admitted, it is not so much a question of the admissibility of a piece of evidence as of the manner in which evidence admitted and admissible can properly be applied. In the view above expressed, the law does not permit the court to make use of certain marks on that document, that is to say, the words \u201cManuel Purdy,\u201d for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the Manuel Purdy to whom the certificate was issued was the same person as the Manuel Purdy who signed the declaration of ownership. That is a proposition of law to which the court cannot refuse to give effect on this appeal; because the Crown by this appeal is asking the court to declare that the monies in court have been forfeited to the Crown and the court must consider whether there is a proper foundation for such a declaration in the evidence before it.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs; but it must not be assumed, by reason of the fact that we have dismissed the appeal on a ground which is not the same as that upon which the judgment of the Judge in Admiralty proceeded, that any disagreement is implied with the reasons upon which the learned judge held that the claim of Barrett to the monies in court has been established.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

[1927], c. 11, section 2, ss. ff\u2014Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 244.\nOn February 4, 1927, one Aboosamra Kouri and his son, Khalil Kouri, one of the respondents, insured their lives jointly with the New York Life Insurance Company, the policy being what is known as a \u201cjoint life insurance policy.\u201d Under this policy, issued on two applications made individually by the father and the son, both were called the insured; and the insurance company agreed to pay to the survivor of them the sum of $24,947, upon receipt of due proof of the death first occurring of either of the insured, whereupon the contract would cease and determine. The premiums were payable during the joint lifetime of the insured. Shortly after the issue of the policy, on February 18, 1927, the respondent Khalil Kouri signed a letter addressed to his father, declaring he had no interest in the policy and stating that, in the event of his father\u2019s death before his, he renounced in favour of his mother, the other respondent, the full amount of the policy; and the latter concurrently accepted in writing the benefit of her son\u2019s interest in the policy. In each of the applications attached to the policy and so forming part of the contract, each insured had reserved unto himself the right and power \u201cto change the beneficiary from time to time \u201c; and accordingly, on March 8, 1934, the father and the son joined in signing a document by which the wife of one and the mother of the other respondent was designated as beneficiary under the policy; such appropriation was duly noted and endorsed on the policy by the insurance company. The father also, by his will dated December 24, 1931, bequeathed all his life insurance policies to his wife. On March 19, 1930, the respondent Khalil Kouri went into bankruptcy and the appellant was appointed trustee. On June 10, 1934, the father died; and the proceeds of the policy were deposited into court by the insurance company, after satisfying a lien of the Bank of Montreal, to which both the insured had assigned the policy as security for a loan. The appellant trustee in bankruptcy then brought the present action to effect a cancellation of the transfer of the policy by the son to his mother and to claim the proceeds of the policy.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 60 K.B. 114) but for different reasons, that the appellant was not entitled to claim any right to the proceeds of the insurance policy.\nPer Rinfret, Cannon and Kerwin J J.\u2014The bankrupt debtor had not really a right under the policy; he held a mere chance of benefit, a mere possibility; and neither that chance of benefit nor that possibility came within the definition of property as contained in subsection ff of section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act; consequently, it did not pass to the appellant trustee. The trustee might have claimed the proceeds of the policy, if the insolvent son were still the beneficiary at the death of his father; but the latter exercised his right to change the beneficiary and the mother then became the sole beneficiary in the event of the death of her husband. The fact that the son joined his father in signing the appropriation document whereby the latter revoked him as his beneficiary could not and did not affect the validity of the document. At the time the new appropriation was made, the father enjoyed full liberty to make it, and it does not matter that his son was then bankrupt and undischarged or even that the father would have been moved to act as he did precisely because his son was then bankrupt; the creditors were not thereby deprived of anything to which they could make a valid claim.\nPer Davis J.\u2014The appellant cannot succeed on the ground raised by him, that the proceeds of the policy belong to the insolvent son\u2019s estate because the policy was not within the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Insurance Act, it being a \u201cjoint insurance policy\u201d of father and son. Under such a policy, the two lives of the father and the son were not insured; but one of them; that of the one who died first. The policy by its terms came to an end with the death of that one. That one in this case was the father who predeceased his son. The son\u2019s life was only conditionally insured in the event of his predeceasing his father and the father\u2019s life was insured conditionally in the event that he predecease the son; and that event happened. Accordingly this case should be decided, as would be decided the simple case of a father insuring his life in favour of his son and subsequently designating his wife as preferred beneficiary; there would be no doubt of the right of the widow to the proceeds of the insurance policy.\u2014A \u201cjoint insurance,\u201d as the one in this case, should be construed as an insurance \u201cby each of the other\u2019s life and not as an insurance by each of his * * * own life.\u201d Vaughan Williams L.J. in Griffiths v.

Ballantyne K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This case has been the occasion for a considerable variety of arguments which, it seems to us, was quite unnecessary and irrelevant.\nThe respondent Khalil Kouri went into bankruptcy on March 19, 1930, and the appellant, Nathan Grobstein, was appointed trustee.\nAs such, the appellant claimed the right to the proceeds of an insurance policy, issued by the New York Life Insurance Company, on February 4, 1927, less a certain amount due to the Bank of Montreal, to which the policy had been assigned.\nThe policy was what is known as a \u201cjoint life insurance policy,\u201d issued on two applications made individually by Khalil Kouri, the respondent, and Aboosamra Kouri, his father.\nUnder this policy, both applicants were called the insured; and the insurance company agreed to pay to the survivor of them the sum of $24,947, upon receipt of due proof of the death first occurring of either of the insured, whereupon the contract would cease and determine.\nThe policy provided for a number of benefits and provisions including: Participation in surplus, dividends, loan values, surrender values, additional methods of settlement, and other benefits and provisions. The premiums were payable during the joint lifetime of the insured. We will now state the facts in the order of their occurrence, although, in the view we take of the case, most of them have no bearing upon the decision, but so that we may have a complete story of the happenings.\nOn February 18, 1927, the policy was assigned to the Bank of Montreal by both the insured as security for a loan. By consent of all parties, the balance due on that loan was paid to the bank out of the proceeds of the insurance policy; and the bank has no further interest in the matter. There remains in the hands of the insurance company a balance of $16,687 available to whoever will be declared entitled to it as a result of the present litigation.\nOn February 18, 1927, Khalil Kouri, so it is asserted by the respondents, signed a letter addressed to his father, Aboosamra Kouri, declaring\nhe had no interest in the policy of the New York Life Insurance Company issued jointly on his life and that of his father;\nand stating that, in the event of his father\u2019s death before his, he renounced in favour of Mrs. Aboosamra Kouri, his mother, the full amount of the policy.\nThe validity of this renunciation, and, in fact, the authenticity of the letter itself was strenuously contested by the appellants upon several grounds. The trial judge implicitly held it good and valid. The majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2] did not pass upon that point, having decided the case upon a ground which made it immaterial whether the renunciation was effective or not.\nOn December 24, 1931, the father, A. Kouri, made his will before a notary and instituted his wife, Mrs. Kouri, his universal legatee and testamentary executrix, bequeathing unto her\nall the property * * * of any nature whatsoever without exception, which I may die possessed of and which will compose my estate and succession, including the proceeds of all insurance policies existing on my life, to hold, use and enjoy and dispose thereof as her own forever from and after my decease.\nOn March 8, 1934, Aboosamra Kouri and Khalil Kouri joined in signing the following document:\nKnow all men by these presents that we, the insured under policy no. 9738981 issued by the New York Life Insurance Company do hereby declare, pursuant to the statutes of Quebec in that behalf, that said policy and all advantages to be derived therefrom shall be appropriated to and accrue for the sole benefit of Najla Zakaib Kouri, whose relationship to us is that of wife and mother respectively. This appropriation is subject to existing assignment. And we hereby revoke any previous directions to the contrary or inconsistent therewith.\nDated and signed at Montreal, Que., this 8th day of March, 1934.\n(Sig.) ABOOSAMRA KOURI.\n(Sig.) KHALIL KOURI.\nSworn to & subscribed\nbefore me this 8th day\nof March, 1934.\n(Sig.) J. A. Villemain, N.P.\nThe New York Life Insurance Company, in accordance with its rules, has retained the duplicate copy of this appropriation, but assumes no responsibility for its validity.\nNew York, Mar. 28, 1934.\nFrederick M. Johnston,\nSecretary,\nPer Trincke.\nAboosamra Kouri died on June 10, 1934.\nThereupon the insurance proceeds became payable to the beneficiary under the terms of the policy.\nSubsequently, on September 17, 1934, the appellant, as trustee of the estate of Khalil Kouri, held a meeting of the inspectors, at which he conveyed to them the information, which he stated to have received on the 13th of the same month, to the effect that Khalil Kouri had an interest in the life insurance policy in question and that Khalil Kouri had transferred his interest in the said policy over to his mother. In the result, the appellant was authorized to take legal action to effect a cancellation of the transfer and pray that the New York Life Insurance Company be ordered to pay to the estate the difference between the amount of the policy and the amount due to the bank.\nBoth the Bankruptcy Court and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissed the petition of the trustee appellant mainly on the ground that the insurance policy was governed by the provisions of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act (c. 244 of R.S.Q. 1925); that, by the terms of the said Act, insurance policies effected or operated under it were exempt from seizure for debt due either by the insured or by the persons benefited; that, by reason of the foregoing, the said policy of insurance did not fall into the bankrupt estate of Khalil Kouri; and that, as a result, the appellant herein had no interest in the said policy, or the proceeds thereof. Before this Court, the appellant strongly urged that the particular insurance policy under discussion could not possibly fall under the provisions of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, because it was a joint life insurance policy obviously, as it was contended, taken out by the insured parties for the purposes of the business in which they were both engaged, and not in any sense of the word a policy taken out by a father for the protection of his child, which is the evident object of the insurance policies contemplated by the Quebec statute.\nThe view of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was that the purpose of the Quebec Act\nwas to create an exception to the general rule in all cases where a parent insured his life in favour of his children, and that a parent can no longer deal with insurance otherwise than as indicated in (that) statute and that all such policies are unseizable for debts due either by the insured or the beneficiary. The Act indicates no exceptions. It sets up no machinery to enable a person to decide whether he is under this Act or any other law. The purpose of the Act seems to be to make all insurance by a husband in favour of his wife, or by a parent in favour of his children, a matter of public policy and to allow such insurance with the full knowledge that the proceeds will not be seizable.\nIn the opinion of the majority, it did not matter whether the policy was a joint life policy or whether it could be classified as what the appellant styled a policy for business purposes.\nAlthough, in truth, all logical arguments tend in the direction of the above solution, it must be admitted that the question presents difficulties, by no means the slightest of which is the declaratory provision contained in section 2 of the Act, whereby\nnothing contained in (it) shall be held or construed to restrict or interfere with any right otherwise allowed by law to any person to effect or transfer a policy for the benefit of a wife or children * * *\nBut we feel greatly relieved that we do not find it necessary to express any opinion upon that point so as to decide this case.\nIn order to be successful, the appellant had to overcome a great many obstacles; and, in our view, he failed at the first hurdle.\nIt was incumbent upon him to show that, as trustee of the bankrupt estate, he had a right to the insurance moneys. Now, under the Bankruptcy Act, a trustee takes the property of the debtor only subject to all the rights and equity to which it was subject while it was held by the debtor. The trustee is the legal representative of the debtor; and generally speaking succeeds only to such rights as the debtor himself would have had, if not bankrupt, and to no other rights. There are, of course, exceptions to that principle, whereby the trustee is vested for the benefit of the creditors with certain additional rights not available to the bankrupt debtor; but this is not a case where these exceptions come in.\nWhether the insurance policy, in this case, is looked upon as a double contract of insurance contained in one document or as a single contract of insurance upon the joint life of the two insured; whether it is envisaged as a gratuitous contract on the part of the father or an onerous contract mutually agreed upon by the father and the son, there is no question that the rights of Khalil Kouri, the bankrupt debtor and the respondent in the present case, stand to be determined by the contract itself, unless it should be decided that the contract itself is prohibited by the statutory law of Quebec.\nIf it be true to say that, under that law, a father cannot insure his life for the benefit of his children, except under the provisions of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, there can follow only two results in respect of the insurance policy now under consideration: 1. Either that policy was made in accordance with the provisions of the Act, in which case section 30 of the Act applies; and then the proceeds thereof are exempt from seizure for the debts due by the insured or by the persons benefited, and, therefore, under no circumstances, do the proceeds of the insurance policy fall into the bankrupt estate and in the hands of the trustee; 2. Or the insurance policy was not made in accordance with the provisions of the Act; and, in such a case, it would be illegal and inoperative; and the appellant would take nothing by his petition.\nOn the other hand, if the policy issued by the New York Life Insurance Company on the 4th February, 1927, be a transaction legally authorized in the province of Quebec, as being \u201callowed by law * * * otherwise\u201d than by the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, it must be interpreted as all other contracts; and we can see no reason why the parties to it should not be bound by the terms to which they have agreed.\nIt is a term of the policy that\nthe policy and the applications therefor, copy of which is attached hereto, constitute the entire contract.\n(Sec. 4.\u2014other benefit provisions: miscellaneous provisions).\nIn each of the applications attached to the policy and so forming part of the contract, we find that Aboosamra Kouri and Khalil Kouri have each subscribed to the following condition:\n5. I designate as beneficiary to receive the proceeds of the policy in event of death and reserve the right to change the beneficiary from time to time:\n(Here the name of the beneficiary is printed in full, with the address of his residence and his relationship to the insured). Consequently, each insured had fully reserved unto himself the right and power \u201cto change the beneficiary from time to time.\u201d This was a condition of the contract, whatever be its character, to which each had subscribed and which was expressly accepted by each.\nIt follows that any right deriving from the policy to one or the other of the contracting parties was necessarily contingent upon the will of either of them that his beneficiary should remain the same as had been designated in the policy. The right to change the beneficiary unqualifiedly vested in each of the insured who, without the intervention of the other beneficiary and quite independently of him, could modify that clause, revoke it and confer the benefit of the insurance on some other person and any other person at his will. (Meunier v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company[3].\nAssuming that the letter of Khalil Kouri, addressed to his father, on February 18, 1927, was not effective as a renunciation to his rights under the policy, the most that subsisted in his favour when he became bankrupt was a conditional right to the benefits of the policy, provided his father did not revoke him as a beneficiary, which his father had the absolute right to do. The appellant trustee, when he became vested with Khalil Kouri\u2019s property, as a result of the bankruptcy order, could take only what the bankrupt was entitled to, and that is to say: the conditional interest in question and no more. (Rees v. Hughes)[4]. In our view, the bankrupt debtor had not really a right under the policy. He held a mere chance of benefit, a mere possibility. And neither that chance of benefit nor that possibility came within the definition of property in the Bankruptcy Act (Subs. ff of Sec. 2). Consequently it did not pass to the appellant trustee.\nThe trustee might have claimed the proceeds of the insurance policy if the father had allowed it to remain in its original form and Khalil Kouri were still the beneficiary at the death of his father.\nBut, on March 8, 1934, the father exercised the right which he had reserved unto himself to change the beneficiary under the policy; and, by a document in due form, he appointed as his beneficiary his wife, Mrs. N. Kouri (the other respondent), to whom he appropriated all the advantages to be derived from the policy.\nAs a consequence, Khalil Kouri ceased to be the beneficiary in case his father died before him; Mrs. N. Kouri, ever since the 8th March, 1934, became the sole beneficiary in the event of the death of her husband; and the appropriation was duly noted and endorsed on the policy by the New York Life Insurance Company.\nIn passing, it may be said that this new appropriation was made in accordance with all the provisions of the Husbands' and Parents' Life Insurance Act and fully complied with all the requirements thereof. (1925, R.S.Q., ch. 244, ss. 12 and 13).\nIt is true that Khalil Kouri joined his father in signing the appropriation document whereby the latter revoked him as his beneficiary. But this was quite unnecessary; for the father, under the terms of the policy and as a . result of the right which he had reserved unto himself, had complete and unrestrained power to make the change, notwithstanding any objection that Khalil Kouri might have raised against that move.\nObviously, the participation of Khalil Kouri in that document could not and did not affect its validity. At the time this new appropriation was made, Aboosamra Kouri enjoyed full liberty to make it. It does not matter that his son was then bankrupt and undischarged. It does not matter even if the father was moved to act as he did precisely because his son was then bankrupt. The father had complete control of his part of the policy and he could yet, designate his beneficiary as he pleased. Any hope of benefit which Khalil Kouri might have had under it was wholly subject to the possibility that his father might change his name as beneficiary; and that is exactly what happened. His creditors were not thereby deprived of anything to which they could make a valid claim. It is quite out of the question to think that they would have had the right to prevent Aboosamra Kouri from appointing a new beneficiary.\nThis is our view of the case before us; and it would also appear to have been that of the English Court of Appeal (composed of Lord Esher, M.R., Bowen and Fry, LL. JJ.) in the case of Ex parte Dever, in re Suse and Sibeth[5]; see particularly the reasons of Bowen, L.J., at pp. 667 and 668 and of Fry, L.J., foot of p. 669 and p. 670.\nThe conclusion which we have reached is none the less satisfactory because, upon the evidence, and throughout the life of the policy, the premiums were always paid by the father, Aboosamra Kouri. Even if the admissibility of the verbal evidence to that effect should be disputed, the fact is nevertheless clearly established by the circumstances. Khalil Kouri went into bankruptcy in March, 1930; and it is evident that the trustee never paid anything on the premiums between the date of the bankruptcy and the death of the father, since admittedly he never heard of the existence of this life insurance policy until \"the 13th day of September, 1934.\"\nFor these reasons, and without expressing any opinion upon the very interesting arguments submitted to us on other points, we think the appeal fails and ought to be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014On February 4, 1927, Aboosamra Kouri and his son, residents in the province of Quebec, insured their lives jointly with the New York Life Insurance Company. The obligation of the policy was as follows:\nNew York Life Insurance Company agrees to pay to the survivor of the insured $24,947 upon receipt of the due proof of the death first occurring of either Aboosamra Kouri (the father) or Khalil A. Kouri (the son) and thereupon this contract shall cease and determine. The father died on June 10, 1934, and the son survived him. On March 19, 1930, however, the son had become bankrupt but it is alleged that shortly after the issue of the policy, that is, on February 18, 1927, he had renounced in writing his interest in it to his mother who concurrently accepted in writing the benefit of her son\u2019s interest in the policy.\nThe father by his will had given all his life insurance to his wife and by a declaration signed by him March 8, 1934, and delivered to the insurance company in his lifetime, had designated his wife as beneficiary of the policy. The insurance company honoured the death claim and the proceeds of the policy, after satisfying a lien of the Bank of Montreal, have been paid into court, there being a contest between the widow and the trustee in bankruptcy of the son\u2019s property.\nThe contract of insurance was made in the province of Quebec. Article 1265 of the Civil Code prohibits husband and wife benefiting each other during marriage by acts inter vivos\nexcept in conformity with the provisions of the law, under which a husband may, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, insure his life for his wife and children.\nBy sec. 3 (2) of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 244,\na father * * * may insure his * * * life or appropriate any policy of insurance held by himself on his life * * * for the benefit and advantage of his * * * children, or of one or more of them.\nBy sec. 4\nthe insurance mentioned in sec. 3 may be effected, either for the whole life of the person whose life is insured, or for any definite period; and the sum insured may be made payable upon the death of such person or upon his or her surviving a specified period of not less than ten years.\nThen by sec. 12,\nany person who has effected an insurance or who has appropriated a policy of insurance, for the benefit of a wife or of a wife and child or children, or of a child or children, at any time and from time to time thereafter, may revoke the benefit conferred by such insurance or appropriation, either as to one or more or as to all of the persons intended to be benefited, and may declare in the revocation that the policy shall be for the benefit only of the persons not excluded by the revocation, or for the benefit of such persons not excluded, jointly with another or others, or entirely for the benefit of another or others, not originally named or benefited. Such other or others must be a person or persons for whose benefit an insurance may be effected or appropriated under these provisions.\nBy sec. 13\nsuch revocation may be made either by an instrument to be attached to the policy * * * or by will * * * and by sec. 30\npolicies effected or appropriated under this Act shall be exempt from seizure for debts due either by the insured or by the persons benefited.\nThese provisions are substantially the same as the preferred beneficiary provisions of the life insurance statutes in the common law provinces.\nIf the case were as simple as a father insuring his life in favour of his son and subsequently designating his wife as the preferred beneficiary, there would be no doubt of the right of the widow to the proceeds of the insurance. It is contended by the son\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy that the proceeds of the policy in this case belong to the son\u2019s estate upon the ground amongst others that the policy was not within the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act because it was what is commonly called a \u201cjoint insurance policy\u201d of father and son. Does this make any difference? The two lives were not insured; but one of them; that of the one who died first. The policy by its terms came to an end with the death of that one. That one in this case was the father who predeceased his son. The son\u2019s life was only conditionally insured in the event of his predeceasing his father. It is equally true that the father\u2019s life was insured conditionally on the event that he predecease the son but that event happened.\nVaughan Williams, L.J., in Griffiths v. Fleming[6], said:\nIt is to be observed that there is a practical reason for construing these joint insurances by husband and wife as insurances by each of the other\u2019s life, and not as an insurance by each of his or her own life, namely, that these joint insurances in practice are generally effected by partners, so as to afford protection against the loss to the surviving members of the firm likely to arise from the withdrawal of the capital of the deceased partner; and in such case the nature of the loss provided against seems to negative the construction which would treat the policy as being on the life of each insuring partner.\nIn that case husband and wife were jointly insured with the event on which the sum assured by the policy was to become payable being stated as \u201con the death of such of the lives assured as shall first die.\u201d The husband and wife had, in that case, the same as the father and son had in this case, before the granting of the policy, each filled up and signed a separate proposal for assurance of the proposer\u2019s life, in the form issued by the insurer, respectively giving therein, in answer to questions, certain particulars with regard to the proposer\u2019s residence, occupation and other personal matters. In the Griffiths case[7] the wife\u2019s proposal stated that the sum insured for was \u201c\u00a3500 jointly with my husband\u201d and, in the case of the husband, \u201c\u00a3500 jointly with my wife\u201d to be \u201cpayable at death. Table 9.\u201d The prospectus published by the insurer in that case contained various tables giving the respective rates of premiums payable in respect of different modes of life insurance, and Table 9 dealt with\nJoint Life Assurances. Policies may be effected on joint lives, the sum being payable and the premium ceasing on the first death. This form of policy is specially suitable for partners in business to replace capital withdrawn on the decease of either of them, or to provide for those who may have been dependent on him.\nIn the present case the only reference to the insurance of the joint lives is in the words \u201cJoint Life\u201d being written in pen and ink across the top of each of the two application forms and the printed words at the foot of the first page of the policy itself, which words are,\nJoint Life Insurance payable at death. Premiums payable during joint lifetime.\nThe policy states that\nThe policy and the application therefor, copy of which is attached hereto, constitute the entire contract.\nIn the Griffiths case6 the wife committed suicide shortly after the granting of the policy and the insurer in an action brought by the husband upon the policy pleaded, inter alia, that the plaintiff had no insurable interest in the life of his late wife as required by the Life Assurance Act, 1774. The plaintiff in reply, pleaded, inter alia, that by virtue of the said policy the lives of husband and wife were jointly assured and that by virtue of such assurance each had an insurable interest in the life of the other; and, alternatively, that the plaintiff insured his life in favour of his wife and the wife insured her life in favour of the plaintiff and that on the death of the wife the sum insured became payable to the plaintiff. There was evidence to the effect that the wife had contributed to the premium an amount which corresponded with the difference in their ages and it further appeared that the wife had rendered services to the plaintiff by doing housework and looking after their children and that in consequence of her death he had been obliged to hire some one to perform these services in her place Pickford J. at the trial held that inasmuch as the wife had performed household services for her husband and through her death he had in fact sustained loss by reason of having to hire some one to perform those services in her place, the plaintiff had an insurable interest which would support the policy. The learned judge therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. Upon appeal, it was held, upon the footing that the policy was an insurance by the husband upon the life of the wife, that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Life Assurance Act, 1774, it was not necessary in order to maintain the action that the plaintiff should prove that he had any pecuniary interest in the life of his wife. Vaughan Williams, L.J., thought the preferable construction was to treat the policy as by the husband on his wife\u2019s life, because he was inclined to think that the husband had an interest in his wife\u2019s life which ought to be presumed, and treating the policy in that way he did not think it necessary to go into the evidence to shew a pecuniary interest in the husband as was done before by the learned judge at the trial. I have quoted above the words of Vaughan Williams, L.J., as to the practical reason for treating these joint insurances as insurance by each of the other\u2019s life. Farwell, L.J., with whom Kennedy, L.J., concurred, thought it plain, from the separate proposals which were accepted by the company, that the husband proposed to insure his own life and the wife to insure her own life for the benefit in each case of the survivor of them and that there was nothing to shew any intention to carry these intentions out by a single policy, unless it were the reference to Table 9, which is the table relating to joint policies. He was of the opinion that the policy should be read distributively as an insurance by the wife on her own life expressed to be for the benefit of her husband contingently on his surviving her, and by the husband on his own life for the benefit of his wife contingently on her surviving him, and that such an insurance was perfectly legal; but inasmuch as the wife\u2019s insurance would take effect under sec. 11 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, 1882, the husband would have to take out administration to her estate in order to comply with the section before he could give a valid receipt for the sum assured if the appeal were decided on that ground, and he preferred, he said, to rest his judgment upon the ground that the husband as such had an insurable interest in his wife\u2019s life and was entitled to recover on his own contract and not on his wife\u2019s.\nThe Griffiths case[8] was not mentioned during the argument and it is the only authority I have been able to find on the true construction of a joint insurance policy. It is interesting to observe that the case involved consideration of the construction and meaning of sec. 11 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, 1882, which permitted a married woman to effect a policy of insurance upon her own life or the life of her husband for her separate use and provided that a policy of insurance effected by any man on his own life and expressed to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his children, or of his wife and children, or any of them, or by any woman on her own life and expressed to be for the benefit of her husband or of her children, or of her husband and children, or any of them, should create a trust in favour of the objects therein named, and the moneys payable under any such policy could not, so long as any object of the trust remained unperformed, form part of the estate of the insured or be subject to his or her debts. There is a striking similarity in the general language of that section of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act with the general language of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act of the province of Quebec, the construction and meaning of which were discussed before us. Here we have a father and son engaged in business, though it is not shewn that the son was actually a partner of his father in the business, and it is plainly indicated by the words \u201cJoint Life\u201d written in ink across the top of each of the separate applications for the insurance and by the words \u201cJoint Life Insurance payable at death. Premiums payable during joint lifetime,\u201d which appear upon the face of the policy itself, that the parties here did intend to effect joint insurance. The fact that almost at the time of its delivery the policy was assigned to the Bank of Montreal as security for the indebtedness of the business to the bank shews that it was intended to be used for a protection of the business. In the event that happened I should construe the policy as by the son on the father\u2019s life. That being so, the policy does not come within the provisions of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act. In that view the proceeds of the policy would not be affected by either the father\u2019s will or his change of beneficiary from his son to his wife. On March 8, 1934 (the son\u2019s bankruptcy was March 19, 1930, the father\u2019s death June 10, 1934) father and son, by an instrument in writing delivered to the insurance company on March 28, 1934, appropriated the proceeds of the policy, subject to the existing assignment to the Bank of Montreal, to the wife and mother, who claims the moneys in court being the balance of the proceeds of the policy after satisfying the bank\u2019s claim thereon. But her counsel does not rely upon this document as a transfer from the son to his mother because of the difficulty that would be presented by the prior bankruptcy of the son. Reliance is put upon a document purporting to have been executed by the son on February 18, 1927, whereby the son renounced his interest in the full amount of the policy in favour of his mother and a document purporting to be of the same date from the mother to the son in acceptance of the son\u2019s renunciation in her favour of his interest in the proceeds of the policy. Those documents gave rise to the real contest in the case. They had not been delivered to the company or notice thereof given to the company before the father\u2019s death and much evidence at the trial was directed to shew that what purports to be the signature of the father as witness to the mother\u2019s acceptance of her son\u2019s renunciation was a forgery. A great deal of evidence was given at the trial on this phase of the matter and the trial judge came to the conclusion that it was not a forgery. The majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, while putting the policy under the protection of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act, expressly declined to follow the learned trial judge in his conclusion as to the absence of proof of forgery. Where a trial judge has seen the witnesses and examined the documents as he heard the witnesses give their evidence and cannot find a serious charge of forgery to have been proved, an appellate court should in my view be very cautious in finding such a charge to have been proved. The matter was discussed before us at some length and I am not only inclined to agree with the finding of fact in this regard by the trial judge but am certainly not satisfied that he was in error in the conclusion he reached. That being so, the son effectively transferred his interest in the policy to his mother by the document of February 18, 1927, nearly three years before his bankruptcy occurred. There is no suggestion that at that date there was any attempt on the part of the son to defeat creditors and the transfer is not impeached by counsel for the appellant upon the ground of it being a fraudulent conveyance in that sense.\nIn the result, though for different reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench with costs.\nIf, however, the policy is to be treated in the event that happened as the father\u2019s policy on his own life in favour of his son, then the policy came under the provisions of the Husbands\u2019 and Parents\u2019 Life Insurance Act and the father effectively changed the beneficiary from his son to his wife, and I would agree entirely with the reasons of my brother Rinfret, who arrived at the same disposition of the appeal along different lines.\nI can see the objection that can be taken to my own preference of dealing with the policy in the way that Vaughan Williams, L.J., did in the Griffiths case[9] because of the words of reservation of change of beneficiary in each of the applications. But a finely printed sentence on a general form of application, obviously intended for individual policies, may be disregarded in my view as inconsistent with the pen and ink words \u201cJoint Life\u201d specially written across the top of each application and equally inconsistent with the words of obligation in the policy itself which was accepted by the insured as a compliance with their applications. That obligation was definite: to pay to the survivor of the two insured upon the death first occurring of either of the insured.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Isidore M.

The word \u201cembezzlement\u201d should not be construed in the same way and with the same specific meaning as it would be construed when used in an indictment under the criminal law. Davis J. dissenting.\nSuch class of bond is not in effect, as commonly known, a surety bond: it partakes more of the nature of an insurance policy than of the nature of a suretyship (art. 1929 CO. Therefore, art. 1935 C.C. which enacts that \u201csuretyship * * * cannot be extended beyond the limits within which it is contracted\u201d has no application to such a bond, which, by its real character, is a commercial contract to which should be given a liberal interpretation. Davis J. dissenting.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting)\u2014Upon a proper interpretation of the language of the policy, the words \u201clarceny and embezzlement\u201d should be given their technical and strict meaning. The meaning of technical terms in a contract of suretyship ought not to be extended beyond what is the strict meaning of the words.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 59 K.B. 295) affirmed, Davis J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Philippe Demers J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action upon a bond issued by the appellant against pecuniary losses by act of larceny or embezzlement on the part of respondent\u2019s employee.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nC. A. Hale K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This action was instituted in the province of Quebec upon a bond called a surety bond, issued by the appellant, The Canadian Surety Company, in favour of the respondent, the Quebec Insurance Agencies Limited, against the\npecuniary losses, not exceeding five thousand dollars, as said (Quebec Insurance Agencies Limited) shall have sustained of money or other personal property * * * by any act or acts of larceny or embezzlement on the part of the (Independent Insurance Agencies Limited), directly or through connivance with others while in any position or at location in the employ of the (Quebec Insurance Agencies Limited).\nIn the bond, the Quebec Insurance Agencies Limited is styled the Employer and the Independent Insurance Agencies Limited is styled the Employee. For the sake of brevity, we will hereafter refer to them by these names.\nThe bond was made and signed on May 3, 1928, in Montreal, and is admittedly governed by the laws of the province of Quebec.\nThe relations of the Employer and Employee were as follows:\nThe Employer did the business of an insurance agent and as such represented several insurance companies. The Employee was in the same business and acted as general agent for the Employer; but, in addition, it represented other insurance agents.\nThe Employee was authorized to issue insurance policies for and on behalf of the Employer. It was supposed to make daily reports to the Employer of the insurance policies underwritten on its behalf; and the method adopted for that purpose was for the Employee to send to the Employer copies of the policies issued during the day. At the end of each month, the Employer prepared a monthly account of the total amount of premiums due in respect of all the policies issued during that month, less the commission earned by the Employee as a result of the issuance of these policies; and such account represented the amount for which the Employee was indebted to the Employer. The Employee was understood to be liable for the amount so shewn in the monthly accounts, whether the premiums had been actually collected by it or not; and the Employer would look to the Employee as its debtor for the balance shown in the monthly account. The Employer was not advised of the payments of the premiums by the insured people and, in fact, was not, in any way, concerned with the question whether these premiums were paid or were not paid. No remittance of a particular premium for a particular policy was ever made or supposed to be made by the Employee to the Employer. There was kept a running account of the transactions between the two; and an accounting was done en bloc for the lump sum due at the end of each month.\nThe regular practice was that the Employee, after receiving the monthly account, was allowed a further sixty days to pay to the Employer the balance shown in the account.\nUp to the month of August, 1929, matters went on satisfactorily; and there were apparently no arrears in the payments made by the Employee to the Employer.\nAfter that month, however, payments began to slow up and so continued through the fall of 1929 and the early part of 1930.\nOn January 28 of that year, the Employer wrote to The Canadian Surety Company, advising them that circumstances were becoming suspicious, that the Employee\u2019s account was overdue and that it was giving notice of this fact in accordance with the terms of the bond.\nOn the 10th of February, 1930, the Employee went into liquidation.\nIt was then found out that the affairs of the Employee were in bad shape. Its books had not been written up since two years. Indeed, it required the liquidator four or five months to have them put in order. The Employer had a claim of $17,753.09 for premiums due to it on policies actually issued on its behalf and figuring in the daily reports, in addition to a further claim of $680.20 of premiums later found out to have been collected by the Employee and unreported.\nAs it turned out when the liquidator succeeded in clearing up the affairs of the Employee, the total liabilities amounted to $52,406.29, and the total assets realized netted a sum of $968.37.\nThe Employer made a claim on the bond to the Canadian Surety Company.\nThe claim was met by the contention on behalf of the Canadian Surety Company, that the Employer\u2019s pecuniary losses were not sustained as a result of any act or acts of larceny or embezzlement on the part of the Employee, and that, consequently, the Canadian Surety Company owed nothing to the Employer in respect of the bond.\nThe Superior Court came to the conclusion that the Employer was entitled to the amount of $680.20, representing the premiums which had never been reported by the Employee, and for a further amount of $2,702.89, being the total sum of items contained in the claim of $17,753.09, which that court found to have been proven as being covered by the surety bond. The balance of the claim was disallowed.\nThe court held that, although the Employee or its officers and servants were perhaps not guilty of larceny, or of embezzlement in the strict sense of the word, yet the surety bond ought to be widely interpreted, and its terms were sufficient to cover the cases of fraud and dishonesty which had been proven to have existed in this instance.\nThe majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side)[2] took practically the same view and affirmed the judgment.\nBefore this Court, the responsibility of the appellant was not seriously disputed with regard to the item of $680.20. The trial judge held it was clearly covered by the bond; and there does not seem to be any doubt that, with regard to it, the judgments appealed from should not be disturbed. Only one question was really raised so far as that item of $680.20 is concerned, and that was that, through some oversight, the commission to which the Employee was entitled on the premium represented by that amount had not been deducted in allowing it to the Employer respondent. Indeed, the Employer seems to have forgotten to put in specific evidence of what the rate of that commission should be in respect of the item in question. It was, however, agreed at bar that the usual commission charged by the Employee during the course of its relations with the Employer was 20%. We see no reason why this small matter should not be adjusted by this Court; and deduction being made of that commission, this award in favour of the respondent ought therefore, to stand, in any event, up to the amount of $544.16.\nIt remains to consider the other item of $2,702.89, representing the total sum of items allowed by the trial judge out of the claim of $17,753.09 for premiums on policies mentioned in the daily reports and which the Employee has failed to pay to the Employer.\nAs already said, the appellant strenuously opposes that claim on the ground that it is not covered by the surety bond, inasmuch as, so the appellant contends, these losses were not sustained by the Employer as a result of any act of larceny or embezzlement on the part of the Employee.\nIt seemed to be common ground between the appellant and the respondent that the Employee could not be charged with larceny; and our discussion of this branch of the case may, therefore, be restricted to the question whether the acts of the Employee constituted the crime which the bond intended to designate under the appellation of embezzlement; and whether, so as to be covered by the bond, the acts of the Employee must necessarily consist in embezzlement; or, as decided by the judgments appealed from, it is sufficient if they are found to have been fraudulent or dishonest and such indeed as to amount to embezzlement, if not in the technical sense, at least in the non-technical or popular sense of that word. On behalf of the appellant, it was strongly urged that larceny and embezzlement were terms of art, relating to something well known and which had acquired specific meaning in the criminal law. It was said that the scope of the appellant\u2019s liability was strictly defined in the surety bond and that it could not be extended beyond the limits within which it was contracted (Art. 1935 C.C.). The word \u201cembezzlement\u201d in the bond had to be construed in the same way as it would be construed when used in an indictment (Debenhams Ltd. v. Excess Insurance Co. Ltd.[3]. The acts proven against the Employee did not come within the strict definition of embezzlement, as was practically admitted by the judgments appealed from; and, therefore, the respondent had failed to establish the responsibility of the appellant under the bond.\nIt should be admitted that the case is not free from difficulty. After having given it careful and anxious consideration, we have reached the conclusion that, on the particular bond subscribed by the appellant and, as a result of the circumstances in this case, the decision reached by the Superior Court and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was right and should not be reversed by us.\nWe have been referred to a number of cases where a similar conclusion was arrived at by different courts in England, in the United States and in Canada; but when the cases there decided come to be compared with the present one, it is at once apparent that none of them could really be regarded as an authority upon which the decision in this case may be founded, because, in those cases, the language of the bond was dissimilar. It is evident that a decision having to do with the construction of a particular document can never serve as a precedent for the construction of another document not in every respect similar to the former one. Although general principles enunciated here and there in some of the judgments cited to us should, of course, be given due weight, it need not be said that the result of the present case depends essentially and exclusively upon the interpretation of the particular bond now under discussion.\nIt is not necessary here to attempt to give a precise definition of embezzlement. The term is not to be found in the Criminal Code of Canada. In a technical sense, it connotes the act of a person employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant fraudulently appropriating to his own use the whole or any part of a chattel, money, or valuable security delivered to, or received, or taken into possession by him, for, in the name, or on the account, of his master or employer (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th ed. p. 230).\nIn view of the relations existing between the Employer and the Employe and of the facts established in evidence, it may be granted that the Employee in this case was not guilty of embezzlement in that technical sense.\nBut it should also be emphasized that if, as between the appellant and the respondent, the bond has to be construed in that narrow sense, it could not possibly cover any act done by the Employee, as such, in the course of its relations with the Employer. Strictly speaking and having regard to the course of dealing, the moneys paid as premiums by the insured to the Employee were not moneys belonging to or owned by the Employer. They never were so in any case throughout the whole course of the relations between the two. They never could be, in view of the agreement between them. It follows that if the respondent should be held to the strict meaning of the word Embezzlement, the bond was absolutely useless for its purposes and of no value to it. This result would be contrary to the rules of interpretation laid down in the Civil Code (arts. 1014 and 1015).\nIt should be taken that the appellant and the respondent, when they agreed upon some sort of suretyship to protect the respondent against the acts of the Employee, must have intended to agree upon a contract which would be of some effect in favour of the Employer. And we think there are evidences of that intention in the wording of the bond, envisaged as a whole, and also the interpretation put upon it in the way it was dealt with by the appellant.\nThat class of bonds\u2014and this is equally true of the present one\u2014is not, in effect, a surety bond; it partakes more of the nature of an insurance policy. The Civil Code (art. 1929) defines a surety as\nthe act by which a person engages to fulfil the obligation of another in case of its non-fulfillment by the latter, etc. * * *\nThis is not quite what the appellant undertook to do under the bond subscribed by it. It did not undertake, nor did it intend to undertake, to fulfil the obligation of the Employee in this case. It promised, under the bond, to indemnify the respondent for such pecuniary losses * * * sustained of money or other personal property (including that for which the Employee is responsible) by any act or acts of larceny or embezzlement on the part of the Employee.\nThis is truly the function of an insurance policy; and we may add that in several instances before this Court a bond of a similar character was treated and was regarded as such; (compare amongst others: The Corporation of the Town of Arnprior vs. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company[4]; Railway Passengers Assurance Company vs. Standard Life Assurance Company[5]; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company vs. The Fruit Auction of Montreal[6]; and there were many others).\nThe main consequence of this interpretation is that article 1935 of the Civil Code of Quebec (by force of which \u201cSuretyship is not presumed; it must be expressed and cannot be extended beyond the limits within which it is contracted\u201d) has no application to a bond like the present one which is in effect an insurance policy and which, by its real character, is a commercial contract to which should be given a liberal interpretation.\nThe respondent, we think very properly, pointed to the fact that when, in the other parts of the bond, the act of the Employee is referred to as giving rise to some action under the bond, it is referred to as \u201cdishonesty\u201d or \u201cdefault,\u201d both of which are clearly not as limited as the word \u201cembezzlement.\u201d\nBut the strongest evidence of the intention of the parties was pointed out both by the trial judge, Mr. Justice Philippe Demers, and by Mr. Justice Saint-Germain in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nClause 5 of the bond is to the effect that\nthe Surety shall not be liable for loss sustained by the Employer * * *\n5in consequence of premiums unpaid on policies issued, although such premiums may have been reported and assumed by the Employee as chargeable to his account. * * *\nNow, if one bears in mind the method whereby the business was carried out between the Employer and the Employee, the exception we have just quoted would indicate that the appellant was fully aware of this method, for the particular clause is clearly intended to meet one of the features adopted by the parties for the conduct of business between them, as it is disclosed in the earlier part of this judgment.\nMr. Justice Philippe Demers and Mr. Justice Saint-Germain point out that the insertion of that particular clause would be quite inconsistent with the interpretation of the word embezzlement in the strict technical sense already indicated. Indeed, the clause proceeds to exclude liability on the part of the Canadian Surety Company for acts which could never conceivably be regarded as larceny or embezzlement.\nIn truth, we think Mr. Justice Demers was right in saying that the clause in question might be construed to mean\nque la caution s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e de rembourser toute partie de primes collect\u00e9es et retenues par l\u2019employ\u00e9, moins sa commission, qu\u2019il y ait fraude ou non. Un homme du commun qui recevrait un pareil contrat l\u2019interpr\u00e8terait \u00e9videmment en ce sens.\nAnd Mr. Justice Saint-Germain adds:\nPourquoi cette distinction entre les primes non pay\u00e9es et les primes pay\u00e9es, au sujet de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie-appelante, si dans aucun cas, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de primes pay\u00e9es ou de primes non pay\u00e9es, la responsabilit\u00e9 de la dite compagnie disparaissait du moment qu\u2019un rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour ces primes et que le montant en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9 par l\u2019Independent?\nWe think the correct view of the bond given by the appellant, since it was undoubtedly intended to be of some value to the respondent, is that it would not be restricted to acts of embezzlement in the technical sense, and we agree with Mr. Justice Demers and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that it should be interpreted as meaning that the appellant would be responsible\npour les montants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus frauduleusement par l\u2019appelante.\nMoreover, there is strong evidence that such is the way in which the appellant itself interpreted the bond it has subscribed in the premises, because when it was called upon to supply to the respondent a form which the latter was to fill in, in order to lay its claim before the appellant, the form which it supplied began by the following words:\nIn the matter of the default of Independent Insurance Agencies Limited for whose honesty the said Surety Company issued its bond in the sum of five thousand dollars * * *\nThe following is a detailed statement of the loss resulting from said default and all sums due and owing by the said defaulter and the balance stated below is the true net loss resulting from the said default, etc.\nThe claim form, moreover, closed with the words:\nThat the foregoing statement is correct and that the loss resulting to Quebec Insurance Agencies Limited from the default of Independent Insurance Agencies Limited is as above stated, and that the items composing the debits are chargeable to the said defaulter on the specified dates and that all sums due and owing by said defaulter to Quebec Insurance Agencies, Limited, are thereby correctly stated.\nThe true effect of the expressions used in that claim form and those which are scattered throughout the bond,\ninterpreted (as they should be) the one by the other (and) giving to each the meaning (to be) derived from the entire act, (art. 1018 C.C.)\nis that the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench were justified in interpreting the bond as they did; and their judgments ought to be confirmed.\nThe definite impression one has from the evidence is that the acts of the Employee, during the last period of its relations with the Employer, were the result of a scheme systematically organized for the purpose of fraudulently depriving the respondent of the legitimate return to it of the amount of the premiums received by the Employee as the proceeds of the policies issued by the Employee in the name and on behalf of the Employer. These proceeds were fraudulently appropriated. (Roscoe, Criminal Evidence\u201415th ed.\u2014p. 597\u2014Kenny, p. 236).\nAs found concurrently by the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the fraudulent intention of the Employee inevitably results from the circumstances established, even if it be true that the premiums themselves, when they were paid by the assured, did not immediately become the property of the Employer; even if, in respect of these premiums, the relation of the parties was that of debtor and creditor. It should not be forgotten that, under the law of Quebec, \u201cthe property of a debtor is the common pledge of his creditor\u201d (art. 1981 C.C.); and the Employee acted consistently in such a way as to render itself insolvent and to defeat absolutely any possibility of the respondent being able to recover the amount of the premiums. (See Kenny\u2014Outlines of Criminal Law, p. 244). It is proven that the respondent has itself paid to the several insurance companies the amounts now forming the basis of its claim.\nThe situation in which the respondent found itself is the result of the fraudulent man\u0153uvres and manipulations perpetrated by the Employee, who appropriated to its own use the moneys which, though not earmarked, constituted practically the only source from which it could expect to pay its Employer. It did so knowingly and with a fraudulent intent (9 Halsbury, 2nd ed., pp. 522 & 523), and with criminal dishonesty (Kenny, p. 234).\nTo use the words of Hamilton, J. (afterwards Lord Sumner), in the case cited by the appellant, Debenhams v. Excess Insurance Company Limited[7],\nhe made away with money that was really its employer\u2019s * * * He converted it to his own use, so that he might have the benefit of it and might cheat them out of it. * * *\nIf, said the learned judge, the jury were satisfied that such was the situation, they were entitled to say, and should say that there was embezzlement against which the plaintiff was insured.\nLikewise, in the present case, we think the respondent has shown a set of facts and the existence of conditions against which it was insured by the appellant and, as a consequence of which he is entitled to have its claim maintained in part.\nThe result is that the judgments appealed from should be upheld, except for the slight modification due to the fact above mentioned that the Employee\u2019s commission on the sum of $680.20 was overlooked in the disposition made of the case both by the Superior Court and by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The amount of $680.20 as already indicated, should be reduced to $544.16. As for the other amount of $2,702.89, also awarded against the appellant, it was not our understanding at the argument before this Court that it was equally subject to the deduction of the 20% commission. It appears to us that this amount was made up of items shown in the monthly accounts and from which, therefore, the commission had already been deducted. In accordance with our present view of the situation, the amount of $2,702.89 should stand as originally allowed by the Superior Court. If, however, we should be mistaken on the point, the matter may be spoken to before the judgment is settled. We wish to indicate to the parties that we agree that the Employee\u2019s commission of 20% should not be included in the amount which the appellant will be called upon to pay to the respondent as a result of the present judgment; but our impression is that such commission has already been taken into account in fixing the balance of $2,702.89. With the modification just mentioned, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavis J. (dissenting): The appellant, as surety, bound itself to pay the respondent such pecuniary losses, not exceeding $5,000, as the respondent shall have sustained of money or other personal property (including that for which the respondent is responsible), \u201cby any act or acts of larceny or embezzlement\u201d on the part of Independent Insurance Agencies Limited directly or through connivance with others while in any position or at location in the employ of the respondent. It was a common form of fidelity bond for an employer\u2019s protection against an employee but the employer, so called in the bond, was a general insurance agency (respondent) and the employee, so called in the bond, was Independent Insurance Agencies Limited, a sub-agent, both being incorporated companies. The sub-agent carried on a general insurance business and acted as agent for other principals besides the respondent. By the agreement between the respondent and the sub-agent, the sub-agent made daily reports to the respondent of the business done by it on the respondent\u2019s behalf; at the end of each month the respondent made up and delivered to the sub-agent a monthly statement of account (on the basis of the daily reports that had been received by it) shewing the amount of premiums payable less commissions and cancellations; the respondent allowed the sub-agent sixty days from the end of each month for payment of the net balance shewn on the statement for that month and sometimes even further delay was allowed. The agreement involved payment of the premiums ultimately by the sub-agent to the respondent whether in fact they were ever collected or not. No specific moneys were, however, intended to be ear-marked and set aside, and there was no obligation on the sub-agent to deliver over in specie the identical money or security received by it. The respondent looked to its sub-agent for payment of a debt. A running debtor and creditor account was thus established by arrangement between the parties. The liability to pay was purely a civil liability. There came a time, however, when the sub-agent was unable to pay and went into bankruptcy. The respondent does not contend that there is any claim based on larceny; the claim is put forward as embezzlement within the meaning of the policy. But a contract of indemnity against loss by embezzlement cannot be turned into a guarantee of the solvency of the sub-agent at the date of the expiration of the periods of delay granted by the respondent to its sub-agent.\nThe use of the word \u201cdishonesty\u201d in the policy in a provision whereby the policy was to terminate on the discovery by the respondent of \u201closs\u201d under the policy, or of \u201cdishonesty\u201d on the part of the sub-agent, cannot in my view extend or enlarge the express risk undertaken by the policy, larceny or embezzlement, to acts of \u201cdishonesty.\u201d Nor can the use of the word \u201cdefaults\u201d be taken to extend the precise words of the obligation. Nor, again, can more or less loose language in the form of the claim papers provided by the appellant enlarge or extend the exact risk covered by the language of the policy itself.\nThe question of law is whether or not upon a proper interpretation of the language of the policy the words \u201clarceny\u201d and \u201cembezzlement\u201d are to be given their technical and strict meaning. There is much to be said for the view that these fidelity bonds are ordinary commercial contracts and that a liberal interpretation may well be put upon them. But upon consideration I have arrived at the conclusion that we are not entitled to extend the meaning of technical terms in a contract of suretyship beyond what is the strict meaning of the words. That was the view taken in Debenhams\u2019 case[8], by Lord Sumner, then Hamilton J. That was an action on a fidelity policy issued to the plaintiffs by the defendants whereby the latter agreed\nto reimburse to the employer (the plaintiffs) to the extent of the sum stated against the name of the respective employed set forth in the schedule contained herein, such pecuniary loss, if any, as the employer shall sustain by any act of larceny or embezzlement on the part of any one or more of the said employed in connexion with the respective duties stated in the schedule hereto.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that one of their employees had received in the course of his employment various sums of money for or on account of the plaintiffs, and had fraudulently converted the same to his own use, and had not paid the same to them. By reason thereof they alleged that they had sustained pecuniary loss by larceny or embezzlement within the meaning of the policy. The defendants denied that the alleged pecuniary loss was caused by larceny or embezzlement on the part of the employee. They said that the question was really one of account between the employee and the plaintiffs. Mr. Justice Hamilton (as he then was) in the course of his summing up said that the term \u201cembezzlement\u201d in this policy meant the same thing as it meant in an indictment. There was no reason for giving it any less strict meaning in the policy by which the plaintiffs were insured than if a direct charge was being made. It was of the very essence of it that the jury must be satisfied that what the man did he did fraudulently and dishonestly; because mere carelessness, mere puzzle headedness, mere objection to discharge his routine business and keep accounts, mere unwillingness to come back to England and settle his account, mere careless omissions would not of themselves constitute, or even evidence, the crime that it is said was committed, unless there was evidence to shew that which he did was dishonestly done. But if he fraudulently embezzled, that was to say, made away with money that was really his employers\u2019, and if he converted it to his own use, so that he might have the benefit of it and might cheat them out of it, then, if the jury were satisfied of that, they were entitled to say, and should say, that there was the embezzlement against which the plaintiffs were insured.\nIn London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Co. v. Bolands Ld.[9], the plaintiff was insured against loss by burglary, housebreaking and theft of cash in the cashier\u2019s office in the plaintiff\u2019s bakery in Dublin, subject to the proviso that\nthis insurance does not cover loss directly or indirectly caused by or happening through or in consequence of * * * riots. * * *\nDuring the currency of the policy, four armed men entered the plaintiff\u2019s premises on a summer evening while it was still daylight, held up the employees with revolvers, and took possession of all the money they could find in the cashier\u2019s office. There was no disturbance in the neighbourhood at the time. In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim to recover the loss, the insurance company relied on the proviso in the policy. The case went to the House of Lords and it was there unanimously held that the insurance company was not liable because the theft was conducted in a manner which constituted a riot at law. Lord Sumner at p. 847 said:\nIt is true that the uninstructed layman probably does not think, in connection with the word \u201criot,\u201d of such a scene as is described in the case stated. How he would describe it I know not, but he probably thinks of something, if not more picturesque at any rate more noisy. There is, however, no warrant here for saying that, when the proviso uses a word which is emphatically a term of legal art, it is to be confined, in the interpretation of the policy, to circumstances which are only within popular notions on the subject, but are not within the technical meaning of the word.\nThe House of Lords in construing the policy interpreted it in terms of legal art.\nEquitable Trust Company of New York v. Henderson[10], is a recent decision of Rowlatt J. There the plaintiffs, who carried on business in New York, took out a policy of insurance in London against loss which they might incur by having acted upon any document which might prove \u201cto have been forged,\u201d and during the currency of the policy the plaintiffs were induced to lend money to a firm by a document containing a false statement of the firm\u2019s assets and liabilities. Before the whole of the loan had been repaid the firm became bankrupt and the plaintiffs sued on the policy. By the law of the State of New York, forgery includes \u201ca false statement of financial condition.\u201d A member of the firm had been convicted in New York of forgery. The plaintiffs contended that the word \u201cforged\u201d in the policy must be construed by the law of New York where the loss occurred and that therefore it was immaterial if the document was not a forgery according to English law. Counsel for the defendant submitted that while the document had been falsely made, that fact did not constitute it a forged document. It had the effect which it pretended to have and was what it pretended to be; its only fault was that it did not tell the truth. The false making of a document was something different from the making of a false document. Mr. Justice Rowlatt said that though the plaintiffs admitted that the policy as a whole must be construed according to English law, they contended that the word \u201cforged\u201d must be construed as defined by the law of the place where the loss occurred. As to this, he held that even if the document was a forged document according to the law of New York, the word \u201cforged\u201d in the policy was used merely to describe an existing state of fact and was not a term of art to be construed according to the criminal law of the place where the loss happened; and he dismissed the action.\nLarceny and embezzlement are technical terms and in construing the language of the policy they should be given their strict meaning.\nSo far in what I have said I have had in mind the major claims in respect of items regularly reported and accounted for but never paid. The items of $680.20, however, were never reported by the sub-agent to the respondent or accounted for, and consequently stand in a different position. The fraudulent omission to account brings these items within the policy.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and reduce the judgment at the trial to $544.16 (the amount of the $680.20 items less 20% agreed commission) with costs of an action of that amount. The appellant should have its costs of its appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) and to this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laverty, Hale & Laverty.\n[1] (1935) Q.R. 59 K.B. 295.\n[2] (1935) Q.R. 59 K.B. 295.\n[3] (1912) 28 T.L.R. 505.\n[4] (1914) 51 S.C.R. 94.\n[5] (1921) 68 S.C.R. 79.\n[6] [1929] S.C.R. 1.\n5\n[7] (1912) T.L.R. 505.\n[8] (1912) 28 Times L.R. 505.\n[9] [1924] A.C. 836.\n[10] (1930) 47 Times L.R.90.\n",

Likewise, an appellate court could also decide, on the evidence, whether the facts were such as to be equally consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused, and accordingly quash the verdict. But, before this Court, when the accused does not urge any ground of complaint against the direction of the trial judge and the evidence is such that the jury might, and could, legally and properly draw an inference of guilt, as held by the appellate court, it is not for the Court to decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the accused was guilty.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellants by a jury on charges of conspiracy and other offences under the Customs and Excise Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nLucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. Crankshaw for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellants were tried and convicted by a jury in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, district of Montreal.\nThe indictment laid against them contains some nine counts, charging them with the offences of conspiracy and with different offences under the Customs and Excise Act The appellant Fraser was found guilty on all counts charged against him. The appellant Brabant was also found guilty on all counts charged against him (eight in number). The appellant Pharand was found guilty on four counts representing what may be called the overt acts, but not guilty on the different counts charging conspiracy.\nAn appeal was lodged by each of them to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) which confirmed the verdict and maintained the sentences in each case. The judgment was unanimous; and the appellants are now before this Court as a result of leave granted by a judge of the Court[1]. Under the Criminal Code, no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada on behalf of any person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed, except \u201con any question of law on which there has been dissent in the court of appeal\u201d (Cr. Code, sec. 1023), or \u201cif leave to appeal is granted by a judge\u201d of the Court (Cr. Code, sec. 1025).\nIn the first case, the appeal is limited to the question of law which has been the object of the dissent in the court of appeal. In the second case, leave can be granted, and this Court holds jurisdiction, only\nif the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nIn the present case, it was common ground that all the evidence upon which the appellants were found guilty was circumstantial evidence. And the point of law on which the judgment appealed from allegedly conflicted with judgments of other courts of appeal in Canada was that the well known rule laid down by Baron Alderson, as far back as the Hodge case[2], and generally accepted and acted upon throughout Canada, had been misinterpreted and misapplied by the Quebec court of appeal in this instance.\nAt the conclusion of the argument and having had the advantage of a complete perusal of the record, we had some doubt as to whether the conflict which seemed to be apparent at first sight\u2014and which alone stands as the foundation of our jurisdiction\u2014did not exist perhaps more in the expression rather than in the real intention of the judgment a quo.\nAs was observed in McLean v. The King[3], \u201cthere is no single exclusive formula\u201d whereby the rule may be stated. It is, however, a rule of general application, and some of the statements made by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court were of a nature to convey the meaning that there were exceptions to the rule. After having stated that one fact in the chain of circumstances proven was conclusive of the appellants\u2019 guilt, the learned judge added:\nOn conviendra, je crois, qu\u2019un tel fait, lorsqu\u2019il se produit, doive mettre en \u00e9chec la r\u00e8gle de droit sus-mentionn\u00e9e a statement apparently suggesting that the present case was one where the rule should not apply. But, at the hearing before the Court, counsel for the Crown was able to show that, taking the judgment as a whole, the statement was susceptible of being understood as indicating that, in view of the existence, in the chain of evidence, of this outstanding fact found to be conclusive, no further doubt could subsist as to the guilt of the accused. As a result of this interpretation of the learned judge\u2019s statement, instead of excepting this case from the application of the rule, on the contrary, he would thus be applying the rule and declaring that, as a consequence of that rule, the evidence surrounding the main pivoting fact established in the case was conclusive of the appellants\u2019 guilt and incompatible with the theory of their innocence.\nHowever, having now heard the appeal, and more particularly in view of the result presently to be announced, there would not be much object in entering upon a more complete discussion of the issue in respect to the conflict, except in mentioning, as we have just done, the state of mind in which the Court was left after a full consideration of the able argument presented to us and a careful examination of the whole record.\nWe will, therefore, proceed to express our view upon the merits of the point submitted by counsel for the appellants which is, in effect, that there was no legal evidence upon which a jury might find a verdict of guilty in the circumstances. The argument of the learned counsel was that, in a case where all the evidence is circumstantial, should the court of appeal not be satisfied, upon its own findings, that the circumstances proven were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person, it ought to quash the verdict on the ground that there was not sufficient legal evidence to support it.\nAlthough, as a general rule, the question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the jury from facts established in evidence is really not a question of law, but purely a question of fact, for their consideration (Gauthier v. The King)[4], there is authority for the view that the rule with regard to circumstantial evidence is not exclusively a rule in respect of the direction which it is the duty of the trial judge to give to the jury or a rule solely for the guidance of a trial judge unassisted by a jury.\nWe were referred to, at least, two cases where the Court of Criminal Appeal in England set aside verdicts and quashed convictions when, after having considered the evidence as a whole, it seemed to the Court to be clear that the evidence was as consistent with the innocence of the accused as with his guilt.\nIn Rex. v. Bookbinder[5], the accused was convicted of larceny by a jury at Derbyshire assizes upon wholly circumstantial evidence. The appeal was heard by Heward L.C.J., Avory and Acton JJ. Counsel for the Crown argued that the jury were entitled to convict as the case depended solely on the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence. The Court came to the conclusion that there was no evidence which was not as consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the appellant. Mr. Justice Avory, speaking for the Court, said:\nWe think that the verdict was unsatisfactory and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The appeal will be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nIn Rex v. Carter[6], the accused appealed against his conviction for indecent assault at Cheshire sessions. The ground for the appeal was that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury in convicting the appellant. The Court was composed of Mr. Justice Avory, Mr. Justice Hawks and Mr. Justice Humphreys. The evidence was circumstantial only. Again Mr. Justice Avory pronounced the judgment of the Court. Summing up the case, he said:\nWhen we come to consider the evidence as a whole, it seems to be clear that the evidence is as consistent with the innocence of the appellant as with his guilt.\nIn all the circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that this conviction was unsatisfactory and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.\nThe appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed.\nIt would appear, therefore, that, when the evidence in a criminal case is purely circumstantial and at the same time equally consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England regards that evidence as insufficient to justify the jury in convicting, holds the verdict unsatisfactory and quashes the conviction, on the ground that it cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.\nTo a certain extent, this would assimilate verdicts based on circumstantial evidence \u201cas consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused\u201d to verdicts where it is claimed that there is no evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of appeal is empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of sufficient legal evidence to support them.\nLet it be granted, however, that such a question should be deemed a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, when once it is established that the evidence is of such a character that the inference of guilt of the accused might, and could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom, the further question whether guilt ought to be inferred in the premises is one of fact within the province of the jury (Reinblatt v. The King).[7]\nThe appellants do not complain of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. No objection was entered by them at the trial; indeed, counsel for the appellants freely admitted at bar that the charge was not open to objection. The direction there given upon the particular point dealing with the duty of the jury with regard to the value of circumstantial evidence and the standard by which it should be measured in the premises appears to us to have been as comprehensive as could be required. The jury was in substance told that, in order to reach a verdict of guilty, it should be satisfied, not only that the circumstances proven were consistent with the appellants having committed the acts, but they should also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the appellants were guilty of the charges brought against them.\nIn the face of that direction, the jury found the appellants guilty. The jury having been properly instructed, within the terms of the rule, their verdict is equivalent to a finding that the inferences to be drawn from the evidence were consistent with the guilt of the appellants, and inconsistent with any other reasonable conclusion, and that is to say: with the absence of guilt. After the direction they were given, the jury must be taken to have eliminated all possibility of the innocence of the appellants as a rational inference from the facts as they believed and understood them.\nLikewise, the court of appeal, to which the case was brought under sec 1013 of the Criminal Code, could decide, on the evidence in this case, that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the appellants were guilty.\nThe appellants having no ground of complaint against the direction of the trial judge and the evidence being such that the jury might, and could, legally and properly draw the inference of guilt, as held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), it is not for this Court to decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the appellants were guilty.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gendron, Mouette & Gaultier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: James Crankshaw.\n[1] [1936] S.C.R. 1.\n[2] [1936] S.C.R. 1.\n[3] [1933] S.C.R. 688, at 690.\n[4] [1931] S.C.R. 417.\n[5] (1931) 23 Cr.

He went on to a grassy strip on the highway, east of its gravelled portion. He met two young boys running southerly on a cinder sidewalk east of the grassy strip. One of them, the the infant plaintiff, 6 years and 7 months old, ran towards the colt after it had passed him and was kicked by it. Said defendant and his father (who owned the colt and was following in a wagon some distance away) were sued for damages.\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting): Defendants were liable. Judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1935] 3 W.W.R. 554, affirmed.\nPer Duff C.J., Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ.: The junior defendant, the moment he saw the boys running along the cinder path towards him, should have foreseen the danger and taken the horses off the grassy strip on to the gravelled roadway. His failure to discharge this duty to the children must, in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, be held to be both the primary and proximate cause of the accident. No intervening act by a child too young to be capable of appreciating an obvious danger, which primarily arises from another's negligence, can avail to relieve that other from the consequences of his own negligence, unless the child's act be such as could not reasonably have been foreseen. The child's act in going upon the grassy strip and following the horses, so likely to attract him, should have been anticipated as a likely consequence of keeping them on the grassy strip after seeing the children running towards them.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): As the pony was lame, the junior defendant acted prudently and properly in travelling on the grassy strip, but having seen the children he was bound to proceed in a reasonable manner and so as not to endanger them. There was no scienter; the colt was under proper control and defendant had no reason to expect that the boy would run after the colt or that the colt would kick. It could not be said, on the facts appearing from the evidence, that defendants were responsible in law for the injury.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of Simmons C.J.T.D. at trial[2].\nThe action was brought to recover damages by reason of injury received by the infant plaintiff when kicked by a colt owned by the defendant W. C. Rickard and led, on the occasion of the accident, by his son, the defendant Herbert Rickard.\nThe accident occurred on March 31st, 1933, on Second street North West, in the city of Calgary, Alberta. The defendant Herbert Rickard, who was 17 years of age, was riding a pony northerly on said street and was leading by a rope a haltered colt on the east side of him. His father, the defendant W. C. Rickard, the owner of the colt, was following in a wagon about half a block back. Herbert Rickard went on to a grassy strip on the highway, east of its gravelled portion. He met two boys, the infant plaintiff who was six years and seven months old, and a companion who was about seven years old, who were running southerly on a cinder sidewalk east of the said grassy strip. The infant plaintiff ran towards the colt after it had passed him and the colt kicked him. There was conflicting evidence as to certain facts in connection with the accident. The facts and circumstances are discussed in the judgments now reported, and in the judgments below, above referred to.\nThe trial judge concluded, on the evidence, that the plaintiffs had not satisfied the burden that was on them to establish by a preponderance in the weight of evidence that the children were still in the \"danger zone,\" that is, in the zone which called for the defendant to keep a look-out for them, when the infant plaintiff ran out after the horses. The Appellate Division (Mitchell J.A. dissenting) held that the trial judge was in error in holding that the defendant had removed himself from the \"danger zone\"; that if the defendant had paid attention to the boys after he passed them, as he should, until all risk of danger was passed the accident might have been avoided, and in his failure to do so he was guilty of such negligence as rendered the defendants liable for the damages caused. It reversed and set aside the judgment of Simmons C.J. T.D., and gave judgment against the defendants for the infant plaintiff for $5,000 and for his father, the other plaintiff, for $457. The defendants appealed to this Court (special leave to appeal having been granted by the Appellate Division in respect of the judgment in favour of the adult plaintiff).\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and W. B. Cromarty for the appellants.\nJ. K. Paul for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014In my view, it was the duty of the junior defendant, when he saw the infant plaintiff and his young companion running along the cinder sidewalk towards the pony he was riding on the boulevard with this young colt beside him, to take the animals off the boulevard on to the gravel roadway. The boys were not more than 150 feet away from him when he saw them running towards him and he ought to have foreseen the danger he was creating for the children by keeping the pony and the colt on the boulevard so close to the cinder path with the colt on the inside. The children were naturally attracted by the spectacle of a young man riding a pony along a boulevard with an exhibition colt haltered beside him, and, if the infant plaintiff did run out from the sidewalk after he reached the horse and colt and run after them, he did what any child of his years might reasonably be expected to do, as the colt did what he might naturally be expected to do, viz., to kick the child when he approached too closely. The danger became apparent the moment the children were seen running towards the animals. It was a danger for which the junior defendant was certainly primarily responsible. In my opinion, he might easily have avoided it by simply turning the animals he was riding and leading on to the gravel portion of the highway, which was the proper place for him to be with them. The child, a boy of 6 years and 7 months, was too young to appreciate the danger himself, and, in my judgment, in the circumstances of this case, it makes no difference where the junior defendant met the boys or whether he had got beyond the boys 10 or 25, or 35 or 70 feet, when the infant plaintiff was kicked. It was the junior defendant's duty to take all reasonable precautions to see that neither of the two children was endangered and not merely to assume that the moment he passed them there was no occasion for him even to look back to see if they were following. The obvious thing for him to do, the moment he saw the little fellows running towards him, was to lead the animals, which were so likely to attract them, away from the boulevard on to the gravel roadway. His failure to discharge this duty to the children must, in my opinion, in the circumstances of this case as disclosed by the evidence of the defendants themselves, be held to be both the primary and proximate cause of the accident for the reason that no intervening act on the part of a child too young to be capable of appreciating an obvious danger, which primarily arises from the negligence of another, can avail to relieve that other from the consequences of his own negligence, unless the act of the child be such an act as could not reasonably have been foreseen. The act of the child in going upon the boulevard and following the pony and colt was, as above suggested, just such an act as the junior defendant ought to have anticipated as a likely consequence of his keeping the horses, of which he was in charge, as agent for his father, the co-defendant, on the boulevard, after he saw the children running towards them.\nIt may be that there was no negligence on the part of the junior defendant in going on to the grassy strip with the horses, when no children were about, though the gravel roadway ordinarily would surely be the proper place for the riding and driving of horses, but the approach of young children, for whose use, rather than that of horses, such a grassy strip along the gravel roadway would seem to have been intended, should have at once brought home to him the danger of continuing there and the necessity of getting out of the children's way. Assuming that he had a right of passage with his horses along the boulevard strip of the public highway, he was clearly under an obligation to exercise that right with due regard to the rights and safety of others thereon, whether young children or adults.\nFor these reasons I concur in the decision of the Court of Appeal and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant, W. C. Rickard, was the owner of a Percheron male colt which at the time of the occurrence complained of by the respondents was ten and one-half months old. It had been weaned four months earlier and had been handled since birth; it was halter broken and free from vice.\nHaving been exhibited at the Calgary Spring Horse Show the colt, on March 31st, 1933, was being taken thence to Rickard's home on the outskirts of Calgary and was in charge of the appellant, Herbert Rickard, W. C. Rickard's son. Herbert was then nearly eighteen years of age and, as the trial judge found, was a competent person for the purpose, having performed all the usual duties of a farm lad and having looked after the colt since its birth. Herbert was astride a pony; the colt was haltered and a stout rope reaching from the colt to the pommel of the saddle on the pony was turned twice around the pommel with the end in one of Herbert's hands. The length of the rope between the colt's head and the pommel was about eighteen inches. W. C. Rickard followed his son in a wagon hauled by a team of horses. In the course of the journey from the show grounds the colt had balked at every set of street car tracks but upon being prodded by the tongue of the wagon driven by W. C. Rickard had proceeded on its way without any further difficulty. The trial judge found that the colt \"was behaving very well up to and immediately preceding the time of the accident. He was under proper control.\"\nWhen Herbert, on his pony, with the colt beside him, was at the corner of 19th avenue and Second street in Calgary and proceeding northerly on Second street, he turned from the gravel portion of the highway to a grassy strip at the east composed of virgin prairie. This was because the pony was lame. Second street is 66 feet wide; in the centre is the gravelled portion about 30 feet in width; adjoining on either side are strips of virgin prairie about 12 to 13 feet wide, and on the eastern limit of the street is a cinder path about 5 feet wide. There is no curb between the various sections of the highway. Midway between 19th and 20th avenues is a lane and when Herbert arrived at a point about 25 feet south of this lane he noticed two boys on the cinder path at 20th avenue running southerly. According to the evidence the boys were then about 155 feet north of Herbert.\nThe chief variations in the evidence at the trial were as to where these parties met, as to where they were when the colt kicked one of the boys, the infant respondent George Ramsay, then six years and seven months of age, and as to the part of the highway upon which the colt was travelling.\nThe respondents' contention is that the parties met at a point approximately 122 feet north of the lane, that the accident happened at the instant of meeting, and that the colt was either on the cinder path or on that part of the grass immediately adjoining the path. The appellants' view is that the parties met opposite a telephone pole approximately 70 feet north of the lane, that the accident occurred 35 feet north of the pole, and that the pony carrying Herbert Rickard was on the westerly edge of the grass plot with the colt immediately next to the pony on the east. The trial judge disregarded the evidence of Mrs. Thomas, the only witness for the respondents who attempted definitely to locate the point of meeting, as he considered she had not been in a position to fix it with any degree of precision. Apparently he deemed the evidence of Mrs. Ramsay and F. H. Bounds as of no assistance on the point, as he makes no mention of it. Irrespective of the findings of the trial tribunal, a perusal of the evidence leads me to the same conclusions. On the other hand, the trial judge found himself unable to accept the evidence of the adult appellant, W. C. Rickard, as that individual was about half a block south of the colt at the time of the accident and was paying no particular attention. With that I also agree. The trial judge apparently relied on the unsworn evidence of Herbert Osterbauer, the seven year old companion of the unfortunate child who was kicked, but, after a perusal of Osterbauer's evidence, I believe it would be unsafe to attach any weight to it. However, I see no reason to disagree with such reliance as the trial judge placed upon the evidence of Herbert Rickard.\nIn view of this and also of the evidence of the respondent James Ramsay (the father of the infant respondent George Ramsay) that he discovered a blood mark on the cinder path 35 feet north of the telephone pole, I conclude that, according to Herbert Rickard, he passed the boys at the pole, and that, according to the location of the blood stain, the accident happened at the latter point. I am also of opinion that the evidence of Herbert Rickard that his pony was on the westerly edge of the grass plot should be accepted. The trial judge did not make any finding in that connection.\nNo one testified that either of the young boys shouted or ran after the colt except Herbert Osterbauer, and, as already indicated, I place no reliance upon his statement. In view, however, of what I have already set forth, it would appear that the infant respondent, George Ramsay, did run towards the colt after it had passed him. While relying on the evidence of Herbert Rickard as to what transpired up to the time of the meeting, the trial judge states that \"he (Herbert Rickard) did not give any particular attention to the boys after he passed them and that his evidence, outside of the location of the children, is not of much value even although some of it is against his interest.\" The part underlined has reference to Herbert Rickard's statement that he watched the boys until the rear of the colt was about 10 feet beyond them and that he had proceeded possibly 5 feet further before he heard the sound of the impact.\nIn dismissing the respondents' action the trial judge took the view that the plaintiff had failed to show how far past the meeting point Herbert Rickard had progressed with the colt before the accident happened, but in my view that problem is solved by the evidence indicated above. In view of the pony's lameness Herbert Rickard was acting prudently and properly in travelling on the grass plot, but, having seen the children, he was bound to proceed in a reasonable manner and so as not to endanger them. There was no scienter; the colt was under proper control, and Herbert Rickard had no reason to expect that the boy would run after the colt or that the animal would kick. I cannot find that he or his father as owner of the animal are responsible in law for the injury to the unfortunate infant respondent. I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1935] 3 W.W.R. 554; [1936] 1 D.L.R. 308.\n[2] [1935] 3 W.W.R. 554, at 554-558; [1935] 3 D.L.R. 623.\n",

Campbell (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1936: March 19, 20; 1936: April 21.\nPresent:\u2014Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Plaintiff, operating defendants' bulk station plant for handling gasoline and oil, injured by explosion\u2014 Construction of plant\u2014Volenti non fit injuria\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Liability of both defendants, having regard to acts, position, and occupancy, of each. Defendant R.O. Co. refined and manufactured petroleum products, and engaged plaintiff, in February, 1929, to operate a bulk station plant, to be constructed at Beiseker, Alberta. R.O. Co. obtained a lease of land on April 29, 1929, on which it immediately had the plant constructed, and plaintiff, in April or early in May, 1929, began operating it. It contained platform scales and pumps for the handling of gasoline and oil, and, in a small room adjoining the main room and entered; by a door from the platform and with no window, a gasoline engine to provide power to operate the pumps, and connected with them by a shaft running through a hole in the wall between the engine room and the warehouse proper, the hole having an unobstructed space of about 60 square inches through which fumes from the warehouse could pass into the engine room. The exhaust pipe of the engine was not extended out of the engine room. There were two storage tanks. On June 1, 1929, the defendant R.D. Co. took over the marketing facilities of R.O. Co. and later wrote to plaintiff that the refining and marketing were operated under different company names, that operations with which plaintiff was connected were to be under the name of R.D. Co., and that he should in future communications use that name. The said lease to R.O. Co. was never assigned to R.D. Co. prior to the accident in question. On Aug. 22. 1932, while tractor fuel was being pumped from a truck into a storage tank, plaintiff, as the pump seemed not working satisfactorily, placed a drum on the scales and made adjustments so that the rest of the fuel in the truck should go into drums. When a number of drums had been filled, and the fuel was coming irregularly and slowly, plaintiff left his position beside the drum to go to a point where he could exchange signals with a man on the truck and, receiving what appeared to be a signal that the truck was empty, he returned to close off the valves, but before that was done fuel overflowed from the drum. Plaintiff then went to the engine room to shut off the engine and while attending to this he saw a flame come from the exhaust, an explosion occurred, and he was injured. He sued for damages. The trial judge charged the jury that the determining factors were three issues of fact:(1) the charge against defendants of negligence in construction;(2) defendants' reply that in any case plaintiff accepted any hazards that were incident to the operation of the plant; and(3) defendants' contention that the accident was chargeable to plaintiff's own negligence in regard to the operation of filling the last drum immediately prior to the accident. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff for damages and judgment was given accordingly, which was affirmed on appeal. Defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ.: The doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher, L.R. 3 H.L. 330, could have no application to this case (Toronto Power Co. v. Raynor, 51 Can. S.C.R. 490, at 503, 505). An employer, though he does not warrant the safety of the plant and property used in the business in which the servant is employed, is under an obligation, arising out of the relation of master and servant, to take reasonable care to see that such plant and property is safe. (The question whether or not, by the common law, he can fulfil his obligation by delegating the performance of it to employees whose competence he has taken reasonable care to ensure, discussed, and Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan, [1915] A.C. 734, Ainslie Mining & Ry. Co. v. McDougall, 42 Can. S.C.R. 420, Brooks, etc., Co. v. Fakkema, 44 Can. S.C.R. 412. Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co., 50 Can. S.C.R. 39, 54 Can. S.C.R. 285, and Fanton v. Denville, [1932] 2 KB. 309, referred to. Where defendant relies upon delegation, the onus is upon him to establish it: Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Anderson, 45 Can. S.C.R. 355). There is no longer an independent rule that, for an employee to recover for injuries sustained from defects in the plant, there must be ignorance in himself and knowledge in the master of those defects (Jury v. Commissioner for Railways, 53 Comm. L.R. 273, at 282). As to the defence of volenti non fit injuria, the question is, did the employee agree that if injury befell him the risk would be his and not his master's? (Smith v. Baker, [1891] A.C. 325; McPhee v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co., 49 Can. S.C.R. 43). The issue of volens in this case was one for the jury. As to contributory negligence\u2014 plaintiff was obviously much concerned about the manner in which the apparatus emptying the truck was working; the overflowing of the drum was not the consequence of any want of zeal on his part; and the jury might, without acting arbitrarily and unreasonably; have thought any slip, any miscalculation or error of judgment excusable, and not incompatible with the absence of negligence. In the view taken as aforesaid, the responsibility of R.D. Co. was not disputed; there would also appear to be a prima facie case against R.O. Co.\nPer Rinfret, Cannon and Kerwin JJ.: On the evidence the jury could reasonably find in plaintiff's favour on the said three issues of fact submitted to them. For a defence on the ground of volenti non fit injuria, it must be found as a fact that plaintiff freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, expressly or impliedly agreed to incur it (Letang v. Ottawa Electric Ry Co., [1926] A.C. 725); it was not sufficient in this case that plaintiff knew it was a common thing for the engine to backfire, that any fault in construction of the building existed from the time he took over the plant, that he knew that the tractor fuel was a highly inflammable product and the vapour from it highly inflammable and dangerous, that he apprehended the danger of a spark exploding such vapour, that he would not light a match there, and that he never complained; the jury had to be satisfied that, not only did plaintiff know, but he accepted voluntarily to run, the risk (Baade v. Hill, [1934] 4 D.L.R. 385, referred to). Both defendants were liable\u2014 R.O. Co., which made the agreement with plaintiff, brought into the plant the dangerous substance for storage; it was, under its lease, the occupant of the land; R.D. Co., which in fact was only a continuing incorporated department of R.O. Co., also occupied the land either as tenant or employee of R.O. Co.; it was in charge of the premises at the time of the accident and had control over plaintiff; (Rainham Chemical Works Ltd. v. Belvedere Fish Guano Co. Ltd., [1921] 2 A.C. 465).\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming the judgment of Simmons C.J., on the verdict of a jury, in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants for $24,585, for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff in an explosion which occurred in a bulk station plant for the handling of gasoline and oil, which the plaintiff was oper- ating. The plaintiff alleged that the plant was supplied by the defendant Regal Oil & Refining Co. Ltd., on land in its possession under a lease, that plaintiff was in its employment as an agent to handle, expose and offer for sale its gasoline products in the district of Beiseker, in the province of Alberta; and that the defendant Regal Distributors Ltd. had (subsequent to the plaintiff's contract of employment) assumed the management and control of the plant. The plaintiff alleged that the explosion occurred by reason of negligence of the defendants. The material facts of the case and the questions involved are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Cannon J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellants.\nA. Macleod Sinclair K.C. and L. A. Walsh K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J. (Davis and Kerwin JJ. concurring)\u2014This appeal should be dismissed.\nFirst, a word as to the law. By the common law, an employer is under an obligation arising out of the relation of master and servant to take reasonable care to see that the plant and property used in the business in which the servant is employed is safe. That is well settled and well known law. It is equally well settled that he does not warrant the safety of such plant and property. (Wilson v. Merry[1]; Young v. Hoffman[2]; Fanton v. Denville[3]). The question whether or not he can fulfil his obligation by delegating the performance of it to employees, whose competence he has taken reasonable care to ensure, is a question upon which it is not clear that the authorities are harmonious. The judgment of the Privy Council in Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[4], as interpreted in the head-note, would seem to say that he cannot discharge this duty by employing competent delegates for that purpose; that, in other words, he is responsible for the safe condition of the plant and premises so far as reasonable care can make them so.\nThere are two decisions of this court (Ainslie Mining & Railway Co. v. McDougall[5]; and Brooks, Scanlon, O'Brien Co. v. Fakkema[6]) which would appear to sanction the rule as stated in the head-note in Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[7]. In the subsequent case of Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co.[8], the distinction is drawn between the original installation of the plant and the maintenance of it. As to original installation, the duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the employee is, under the decisions of this Court, as finally interpreted in Bergklint's case8, one of which the employer cannot divest himself by appointing competent delegates, while, under the common law, the opposite is the case in respect of subsequent maintenance. These decisions are, perhaps, in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Fanton v. Denville[9], and, possibly, with other decisions of that Court.\nIn the present case, we are really not concerned with this conflict (if such there be) for two reasons. First, no evidence was offered to show that the employers had exercised care in entrusting the duty of making the plant safe for the employees to competent delegates; and, where the defendant relies upon delegation, the onus is upon him to establish it (Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Anderson[10]). Second, the doctrine of common employment has been abrogated in Alberta (R.S.A. 1922, c. 178, s. 2).\nI cannot endorse the argument that the employee can only succeed by establishing ignorance in himself and knowledge in the master. I agree with the following passage in the judgment of Rich and Dixon JJ. in Jury v. Commissioner for Railways[11]:\nThere is no longer an independent rule demanding ignorance in the servant and knowledge in the master. But negligence in the master, or those for whom he is responsible, if any there be, must be proved, and knowledge is one way but not the only way of proving it. The servant must not have consented to the consequences of the master's negligence, but his mere knowledge does not prove consent. He must not have been guilty of contributory negligence, but still less does his mere knowledge prove that he was. Such being the state of the law, I have only to add that the doctrine in Rylands v. Fletcher[12] can have no application. This was expressly held by the majority of this Court in Toronto Power Co. v. Raynor[13]. In my judgment in that case I said:\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Clute in the Court of Appeal proceeds, as far as I can gather, on the application of the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher(1).\nThis doctrine has never been applied and could not, without bringing the direst confusion into the law on the subject, be applied in cases of this description between master and servant, where apart from statute the question must always be (the master being charged with responsibility for harm coming to the servant in the course of his employment): Was the harm caused by the failure of the master in any duty to the servant arising out of the relation subsisting between them? The duty of protecting or compensating the servant for harm arising from the perils incidental to the service which cannot be avoided by any reasonable degree of care on the part of the master, is not one of the duties which the law casts upon the master.\nOn the contrary,\nThe doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher(1) imposes a responsibility which in the first place is, speaking generally, absolute for the consequences of the escape of the noxious agent (excepting where the escape is due to the act of God or the mischievous intervention of a third party) and in the second place cannot be discharged by employing independent contractors or servants never so competent and never so well equipped as to skill and means.\nThe appellants can only succeed, then, on one of two grounds: contributory negligence or volenti non fit injuria. As regards the defence of volens, the question, as Lord Watson said in Smith v. Baker[14], is, did the employee agree that if injury befell him the risk would be his and not his master's? This defence was very fully discussed in McPhee v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co.[15] where Smith. v. Baker (supra) and Williams v. Birmingham Battery & Metal Co.[16] were applied.\nI do not think it is seriously open to question that the issue of volens was in this case one for the jury.\nThere is much more to be said in favour of the appeal under the contention that the finding of the jury negativing; contributory negligence cannot be supported. After, however, carefully considering and reconsidering the evidence in its bearing upon this issue, my conclusion is that the judgment of the Court of Appeal ought not to be reversed. The respondent was obviously much concerned about the manner in which the apparatus emptying the truck was working. The overflowing of the drum was not the consequence of any want of zeal on his part. In the result, I am not satisfied that the jury might not, without exposing themselves to a charge of acting arbitrarily and unreasonably, have thought any slip, any miscalculation or error of judgment excusable; and not incompatible with the absence of negligence either as commonly understood by laymen or in the sense of the law.\nIn the view just expressed, the responsibility of the Regal Distributors, Ltd., is not disputed; there would also appear to be a prima facie case against the other company.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCANNON J. (Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. concurring)\u2014The appellants appealed before this Court from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing their appeal from the judgment of the trial Court based upon the verdict of a jury which awarded the plaintiff damages to the sum of $24,585. The appellant, the Regal Oil and Refining Co. Ltd. (hereinafter called the Refining Co.), is engaged in the refining and manufacture of petroleum products, and the appellant, Regal Distributors Ltd. (hereinafter called the Distributing Co.), in the distribution of such products. The Refining Company engaged the respondent by an agreement in writing dated February 15, 1929, to operate for it a bulk station plant at Beiseker. The Refining Co. was granted a lease of land on the 29th of April, 1929, on which immediately thereafter was erected the plant in question by a contractor engaged by the Refining Co. The building and equipment were turned over to the respondent late in April or early in May, 1929. It consisted of a building constructed of corrugated iron on a wooden frame and contained platform scales and Blackmore twin pumps for the handling of gasoline and oil. In addition to the main room of the plant there was an adjoining room about 6 feet square in which was housed a Fairbanks-Morse gasoline engine. This engine room contained no window and was entered by a door from the platform. The power to operate the pumps was provided by the engine which was connected with the pumps by a shaft 1\u00bd inches in diameter which ran from the engine through the wall between the engine room and the warehouse proper. This shaft passed through a hole in the wall which was about 10 inches from the floor and about 10 inches in diameter. Notwithstanding the presence of a gear box, there would be left, after taking this obstruction into account, approximately an area of 60 square inches, through which fumes from the warehouse could pass into the engine room. The exhaust pipe of the gasoline engine was not extended out of the engine room and any fumes or sparks from the engine were projected into the room. The equipment in addition included two storage tanks. No. 1 was used for gasoline and No. 2 for tractor fuel.\nOn the 1st June, 1929, the Distributing Company took over the marketing facilities of the Refining Company. On the 16th of September, 1929, the Distributing Company wrote a letter on the notepaper of the Refining Company to the respondent, informing him of the change in \"the organization of the different branches of our Company,\" and that his operations were to be carried on under the name of the Regal Distributors Limited. After some changes in the mechanical equipment to permit the shipping of the petroleum products to this station in automobile tank trucks, the first such shipment was received at about 3.30 p.m. on the 22nd of August, 1932. The respondent had received instructions pointing out to him the importance of emptying such trucks as speedily as possible. The trucks had been hired by the Refining Company and contained tractor fuel, which is admitted to be of a highly inflammable nature. During the operation of pumping the contents of the truck into the storage tank No. 2, the pump was not working to the respondent's satisfaction and he decided that the remainder of the tractor fuel, about 500 gallons, should be placed into drums. To do so he placed the drum on scales; and by an adjustment of valves, the destination of the flow from the truck was changed from the storage tank to the drum. After filling seven or eight drums in this manner, he found that the fuel was coming very irregularly and very slowly. One Schultz was on top of the truck watching the progress of the pumping and exchanged signals with the respondent, who would move from his position to a point on the platform from which he could see Schultz to determine if the truck was about empty. Having received from Schultz a signal which he understood as meaning that the tank was empty, the respondent turned to go in and turn off the quick closing valve located immediately above the scales, and at that moment he saw the tractor fuel overflow from the drum and Russel, the truck driver, run and close the valve. The respondent then went into the engine room and shut off the engine by closing the fuel valve and turning down the oil cup. As he was leaning over the engine to close the latter, he saw a bunch of flame come from the exhaust. There were one or two explosions which blew the respondent through the wall of the engine room and deposited him on the ground at the rear of the truck with his clothing in flames. As a result of the accident, the respondent has lost completely the use of both hands, after undergoing great pain and suffering and actual out of pocket expense of $584.90.\nIn his charge, the learned trial judge stated that the determining factors in the case were three issues of fact: first, the claim by the respondent that the appellants were negligent in the construction and maintenance of this plant for the storage and delivery of dangerous explosives; second, the reply by the defendants that in any case the respondent accepted any hazards that were incident to the operation of that plant; and third, that the accident was chargeable in whole or in part to the respondent's own negligence in regard to the operation of filling the last drum immediately prior to the accident.\nRespecting the first point, complaints in regard to the structure were: (a) the exhaust pipe was not carried out from the smaller enclosure in which the gasoline engine was placed; (b) there was an opening in the wall near the floor of that structure that would allow vapour fumes to get into the engine room. The learned trial judge pointed out, and my reading of the record confirms his view, that the evidence of Mr. Robb, the expert, which was not contradicted, is to the effect that if these features had not existed, it would have been a safer structure for the purpose for which it was intended; he added that it was the duty of the appellants to construct the building and plant in a way that would not expose employees or anyone who had occasion to come around it, to unnecessary danger. Referring to the first ground of defence, that the respondent had accepted the hazard which would naturally be incident to a plant of this kind, knowing that naphtha and gasoline are wry volatile and would evaporate in warm weather and the vapour spread around, and also to the fact that the respondent knew from long experience how to run the engine, the jury were asked to decide whether or not the respondent could be reasonably justified in assuming that the appellants' construction engineer should be capable of determining what would be a reasonably safe arrangement, and whether or not the respondent would be chargeable with a technical examination of all the plant to satisfy himself it was absolutely safe before he entered on his employment. It was also pointed out that the plant was not there at all when he entered this employment.\nAs to the third issue, the learned trial judge also put the question to the jury, whether or not the respondent was negligent when he left his position at the scales when he thought that the drum was only about one-half full.\nWas it necessary for him to go away from that drum, go to the point on the platform where he could not readily turn off that quick acting valve. If there is an explanation which you think is proper and reasonable, having regard to his duties, I suppose you would be justified in saying he was not negligent; but then on the other hand, if it was not necessary for him to investigate this condition of the tank, then it would seem that he might better have stayed at his own point of duty. Secondly, I would say that if it could be reasonably contemplated that what happened might happen as a result of him leaving that point of duty, it would be a very serious question for you to consider whether he is chargeable with negligence.\nThe learned trial judge then said that independently of the overflow of gasoline which the jury might or might not attribute to the negligence of the respondent, it was the uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Robb, the expert, to the effect that there would be a certain amount of gasoline vapour expelled from the drums and that if that vapour from the drums got into the engine room, it must have contributed to the accident.\nThe appellants, realizing that they have to contend against the verdict of the jury and the concurrent judgments of both courts below on these three questions of fact, submit:\n1st. There is no negligence proven against either of the appellants; 2nd. There is certainly no justification for a judgment against both defendants;\n3rd. The plaintiff respondent's contributory negligence disentitles him to any verdict;\n4th. The maxim: Volenti non fit injuria, affords a complete defence.\n5th. The learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury properly or at all for the failure of the appellants to instal an automatic barrel filler and the liability of the appellants with respect thereto. This point was not insisted upon at the argument before us. The jury came back to court and asked for the reading of the evidence on that point. Appellants never asked for a special direction, and, in any case, the absence of instructions would seem to have favoured the appellants more than the respondent, because the latter suggested to the appellants' inspector the desirability of such an addition to the plant which would have prevented any overflow.\n6th. The damages awarded were excessive and unreasonable.\nThe position of the respondent in regard to all these points is that the jury has found in his favour on competent evidence, and he quotes the definition of the function of this Court by My Lord, the Chief Justice, in C.N.R. v. Muller[17], where he said:\nWe premise that it is not the function of this Court, as it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal to review the findings of fact at which the jury arrived. Those findings are conclusive unless they are so wholly unreasonable as to show that the jury could not have been acting judicially. * * * In construing the findings, moreover, one must not apply a too rigorous critical method; if, on a fair interpretation of them, they can be supported upon a reasonable view of the evidence adduced, effect should be given to them.\nThe jury had before them the opinion of Mr. Charles A. Robb, Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the University of Alberta, who, the appellants readily admitted, was duly qualified as an expert, who said:\nQ. Will you tell His Lordship and the jury what in your opinion was the cause of that fire?\nA. In my judgment the fire resulted in the bringing together of a mixture of gasoline fumes with air in proportions suitable for combustion.\nQ. Now just to deal with that while we are at it. Would you tell us what that mixture is that you speak of? A. We describe a mixture of gasoline or naphtha fumes and air as being inflammable when these are present in the proportion of one and a half per cent of gasoline fumes up to six per cent. the remainder being air.\n* * *\nQ. Mr. WALSH: When you have this mixture of from one point five per cent to six per cent by volume of gasoline fumes with air what else is needed to cause trouble?\nA. The introduction of a spark or flame is sufficient.\nThe professor also told the jury that in this case the naphtha was simply a mechanical mixture with the distillate and, as such, is as dangerous to handle for all practical purposes as if it were pure gasoline and he ends his direct examination as follows:\nQ. Mr. WALSH: It was as inflammable as gasoline? What we laymen speak of as gasoline that we use in our cars?\nA. The answer is in the affirmative, yes.\nQ. Here is another question, in your opinion would this plant have been capable of safer operation with the engine house in a building entirely separate from the warehouse?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So then to recapitulate you say that the first safety measure that might have been taken was some form of separation of the engine room from the warehouse?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Having in view the object of preventing fumes of gasoline and tractor fuel from the warehouse entering the engine room?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you say second, that you would have piped the exhaust from that engine to a place of safety outside the building?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You agree with me that the automatic drum filler would have been of some assistance as a safety measure?\nA. I do.\nQ. And finally you say that it would have been better if they had had them in a separate building?\nA. Yes.\nIn view of the facts proven and of this competent evidence, the jury could reasonably find, as they did, and return a verdict in favour of plaintiff on the three issues of fact submitted to their consideration, as shown above.\nAs to the application of the maxim \"volenti non fit injuria,\" as it was clearly set out in Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.[18], it must be found as a fact, in order to afford a defence to an action for damages for personal injuries due to the dangerous condition of the premises to which the plaintiff has been invited on an errand of business, that he freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, expressly or impliedly agreed to incur it. Lord Shaw, at page 730, quoting Bowen L.J., in Thomas v. Quartermaine[19], says:\n\"The maxim, be it observed, is not ' scienti' non fit injuria\u2014but 'volenti.' It is plain that mere knowledge may not be a conclusive defence. * * * The defendant in such circumstances does not discharge his legal obligation by merely affecting the plaintiff with knowledge of a danger. * * * Knowledge is not a conclusive defence in itself. But when it is a knowledge under circumstances that leave no inference open but one, namely, that the risk has been voluntarily encountered, the defence seems to me complete.\"\nThe evidence adduced by the defendants was fully put to the jury by the learned trial judge to show that the respondent knew that it was a common thing for the engine to backfire from time to time; that if any fault existed in the construction of the building it existed from the time the respondent took over the plant; that he knew that the tractor fuel was a highly inflammable product and the vapour from it highly inflammable and dangerous; that he apprehended the danger of a spark exploding this kind of vapour; that he would not light a match there, and that he never complained. According to the rule above quoted, this would not be sufficient; the jury had to be satisfied that, not only did the plaintiff know, but that he accepted voluntarily to run the risk. See Baade v. Hill[20], and the authorities therein collected in the able judgment of Hughes J.\nThe appellant failed to show to the satisfaction of the Court that the damages awarded were excessive and unreasonable, and indeed did not insist before us for a reduction of the amount. The respondent proved that he was now totally incapacitated so far as manual labour was concerned, that he earned before the accident about $2,500 a year; according to the insurance statistics, his natural earning period would be about 32 years.\nEven taking into account the natural vicissitudes, including accidents, diseases and possible death, we cannot say that the amount awarded under those circumstances is unreasonable.\nDespite the able argument of Mr. Biggar, we must reach the conclusion that he has not successfully established that the findings of the jury or the courts below were clearly wrong on the facts of the case. There remains the point of the joint liability of both appellants. Are they both liable if the verdict stands? The Refining Co. made the agreement, also secured the lease from the C.P.R. of the site where they built the plant and gathered the dangerous explosives. Both companies have the same general manager and the following notice was sent to the respondent:\nREGAL OIL & REFINING COMPANY, LIMITED.\nCALGARY, ALTA., SEPT. 16, 1929.\nThe Agent,\nRegal Distributors Ltd.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014For some time past there has been a change in effect with regard to the organization at the different branches of our Company. Each department such as Refining and Marketing are operated under different Company names.\nAll operations with which you are connected are to be operated under the name, of the REGAL DISTRIBUTORS LIMITED and we would ask, in future, that all communications or any other matters in which you may be called upon to use the name of the Company to use \"Regal Distributors Limited\" exclusively.\nYours very truly,\nREGAL DISTRIBUTORS LTD.\nH. E. McDonald,\nSales Manager.\nThe Distributing Company is the one who was in charge of the premises at the time of the accident and had control over the respondent. Under the principle laid down in Rainham Chemical Works Ltd. v. Belvedere Fish Guano Co. Ltd.[21], both these companies would be liable towards the plaintiff. The Refining Company by the hands of its employees brought into the plant the dangerous substance for storage on the site which it had leased from the C.P.R. The lease provided that \"the lessee will not during the said term, assign or sublet the said premises or any part thereof unto any person or persons, without first obtaining the written consent of the lessor.\" The lease was never assigned to the Distributing Company prior to the date when the plaintiff sustained his injuries. The Refining Company, therefore, was the occupant of the lands at all times prior to this action. As far as the Distributing Company is concerned, which in fact is only a continuing incorporated department of the Refining Company, it also occu- pied the land either as tenant or employee of the Refining Company. \"They cannot escape any liability which otherwise attaches to them on storing it (the explosive) there merely because they have no tenancy or independent occupation of the land but use it thus by permission of the tenants or occupiers,\" quoting the words of Lord Sumner, in the above case, at page 479.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1868) L.R., 1 Sc.

In the year 1932, a competition was held; and, after the examination had been completed and all the judges had handed over to the secretary of the jury the ballots on which each of them had inscribed the respective number of marks allowed to each candidate, on each subject, and the number of marks for each candidate had been added up and arranged, it was found that the mis-en-cause Pich\u00e9 ranked first with 81.9 marks and the respondent, Payment, with 81.1 marks. Thereupon, one of the examiners, Morin, expressed the opinion that respondent\u2019s marks should be increased so that the scholarship be awarded to him because in his opinion he deserved it; and another examiner, Bernier, in order to obtain such result, got back his ballot from the secretary and granted five marks more to respondent. The latter was accordingly declared the winner of the scholarship. A few days after the examination, another competitor, one B\u00e9langer, wrote to the vice-president of the Academy that he had not been awarded for his musical dictation the marks he thought he was entitled to. The officers of the Academy ascertained the fact that an obvious error had occurred in B\u00e9langer\u2019s case and thought that it would be expedient that the whole examination should be reviewed. The president of the Academy then called a meeting of the members of the jury and of the officials of the Academy, which took place on July 21, 1932. At that meeting, mistakes and errors in the allocation of marks to the respondent and Pich\u00e9 were admitted by the members of the jury, a rectification was made accordingly, and, as a result, the mis-en-cause Pich\u00e9, having obtained 84.8 marks, while the respondent had only 76.9, was awarded the scholarship. The respondent, under art. 50 C.C.P., then took an action against the Academy of Music and the members of the jury for a declaration that he had won the scholarship and, claimed all the advantages deriving therefrom, and, also, for $5,000 damages. The trial judge dismissed the action, holding that the respondent had not won the scholarship, that the Academy of Music rightly refused to award it to him and that the Academy of Music could not be held liable for fraud committed by some of the examiners, and mistake by the others. The Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed this judgment, holding that the examiners were arbitrators, that they had become functi officio the moment they had signed their first report; that court annulled the decision of the jury rendered on July 21, 1932, and condemned the appellant to pay $1,000 damages to the respondent.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 59 K.B. 121) Cannon J. dissenting, that under the circumstances of this case, the respondent was not entitled to claim the scholarship and that the appellant was right in refusing to award it to him. Even admitting that the decision reached at the meeting of July 21, 1932, (which, according to the facts, cannot be considered as a second verdict, but as a rectification of the first verdict), was illegal and null, this Court had still the right and the duty to decide, what the court appealed from has failed to do, whether the first verdict was valid and legal, as such verdict had been contested by the appellant in its plea. It was not only the right, but also the duty, of the appellant, as mandatory of the legislature in the distribution of public moneys, to investigate the proceedings of the jury and, after having found evident errors and illegalities, which were admitted by the members of the jury at the meeting of July 21, 1932, and have been held as proven by the trial judge, to award the scholarship to the competitor who had obtained \u201cthe highest number of marks\u201d according to the statute.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting).\u2014The only regular competition for the scholarship of 1932 and the only official examination of the competitors had taken place on June 16 and 17, 1932. The respondent is entitled to claim the benefit of the unanimous decision of the jury rendered on June 17 and of the official document, bearing the seal of the Academy, which stated that he was the winner of the scholarship. The jury, after having rendered its verdict, had no more powers to act as such (functus officio). The proceedings subsequent to the first verdict as well as the second verdict were illegal, as the statute incorporating the Academy does not provide for any appeal from the decision of the jury to the executive committee of the Academy or to the members of the jury individually or collectively. If the officials of the Academy were of the opinion that there had been fraud, partiality or errors in the conduct of the competition, they should have proceeded by way of action under art. 50 C.C.P. to annul the verdict of the jury.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Demers Philippe J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLs.

Ne peuvent prendre part au concours que les porteurs de dipl\u00f4mes de laur\u00e9at de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec qui sont sujets britanniques, \u00e2g\u00e9s de pas plus de vingt-cinq ans et qui r\u00e9sident dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec depuis trois ans au moins. L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie doit cependant, aux conditions qu\u2019elle juge \u00e9quitables, admettre \u00e0 concourir pour le dipl\u00f4me de laur\u00e9at les \u00e9l\u00e8ves des autres institutions musicales de la province.\nLes boursiers doivent, pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des avantages que leur conf\u00e8re cette loi, suivre le programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec.\nEt voici comment la loi d\u00e9finit de quelle fa\u00e7on doit \u00eatre choisi le gagnant de la bourse:\n(c) Celui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de points a le droit d\u2019aller, aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, passer deux ans en Europe pour y compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales.\nCela veut dire \u00e9videmment que le jury nomm\u00e9 par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie pour juger le concours sp\u00e9cial ouvert chaque ann\u00e9e doit attribuer un certain nombre de points \u00e0 chaque concurrent, que celui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de ces points se trouve \u00eatre le gagnant de la bourse et qu\u2019il acquiert, par le fait m\u00eame, le droit d\u2019aller en Europe, pendant deux ans, compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie.\nPour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ouvrit le concours sp\u00e9cial et en fixa la date aux 16 et 17 juin de cette ann\u00e9e.

A cette fin, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie chargea l\u2019abb\u00e9 Alphonse Tardif d\u2019\u00e9crire une basse chiffr\u00e9e de huit mesures et un chant donn\u00e9, \u00e9galement de huit mesures, qui devaient faire l\u2019objet du concours d\u2019harmonie \u00e9crite \u201cen rapport avec le programme indiqu\u00e9 dans la circulaire du prix d\u2019Europe\u201d. M. Emile Larochelle fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour \u00e9crire un solf\u00e8ge de seize mesures avec accompagnement, une dict\u00e9e musicale de douze mesures et cinq questions d\u2019histoire sur la musique. C\u2019est ainsi que les conditions du concours furent fix\u00e9es et qu\u2019elles furent accept\u00e9es par le jury et par les concurrents qui se pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent au nombre de neuf.\nDe ces concurrents, il suffit de retenir trois noms: MM. Bernard Pich\u00e9, Edwin B\u00e9langer et Jules Payment (le demandeur-intim\u00e9). Au concours, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve faite au proc\u00e8s, les membres du jury proc\u00e9d\u00e8rent de la fa\u00e7on suivante: les examens \u00e9crits furent confi\u00e9s \u00e0 un seul d\u2019entre eux, M. L\u00e9o-Pol Morin, qui corrigea les copies et attribua les points. Le nombre de points ainsi accord\u00e9s par lui fut ensuite communiqu\u00e9 aux autres membres du jury, qui s\u2019en rapport\u00e8rent \u00e0 lui sans faire d\u2019examen individuel pour leur propre compte et inscrivirent sur le bulletin qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux \u00e0 cet effet les chiffres octroy\u00e9s par M. Morin pour l\u2019examen \u00e9crit.\nApr\u00e8s avoir rempli leurs bulletins, les membres du jury les remirent au secr\u00e9taire du concours; puis, dans le but de constater quel \u00e9tait celui des concurrents qui avait obtenu le plus grand nombre de points, le secr\u00e9taire proc\u00e9da \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, pour chaque mati\u00e8re, le pourcentage des points attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque candidat par chaque membre du jury, le total de la r\u00e9sultante sur chaque mati\u00e8re devant fixer le chiffre obtenu par chaque concurrent.\nLorsque ce calcul fut termin\u00e9, il fut constat\u00e9 que Bernard Pich\u00e9 avait obtenu 81.9 et Jules Payment, l\u2019intim\u00e9, 81.1. Sur quoi, M. Morin dit:\nM. Pich\u00e9 a 81-9 points; M. Payment en a 81.1. Le nombre des points de M. Payment doit \u00eatre augment\u00e9 afin d\u2019avoir la bourse, car il la m\u00e9rite \u00e0 tous les points de vue,\nou encore:\nMalgr\u00e9 les points que vous nous soumettez, que les juges ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s d\u2019apr\u00e8s leurs bulletins, je persiste \u00e0 vouloir nommer M. Payment boursier du prix d\u2019Europe.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. J.-A. Bernier, M. Morin avait une th\u00e9orie\nqu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9velopper le musicien avant le technicien * * * et donner le prix \u00e0 M. Payment, sans \u00e9gard aux points qui pouvaient marquer une majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Pich\u00e9. Alors, de sa propre admission, M. Bernier s\u2019adressa au secr\u00e9taire et lui demanda:\nDe combien faudrait-il que j\u2019augmenterais mon bulletin afin que M. Payment arrive en premier lieu?\nLe secr\u00e9taire lui fit remarquer que, comme le calcul des points se faisait par pourcentage, il faudrait \u00e0 M. Bernier augmenter de cinq points les chiffres d\u00e9j\u00e0 marqu\u00e9s sur son bulletin afin que, le pourcentage \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, le nombre des points de M. Payment fut augment\u00e9 d\u2019une unit\u00e9. Et c\u2019est ce que fit imm\u00e9diatement M. Bernier.\nAu proc\u00e8s, la Cour lui posa la question:\nQ. Vous avez augment\u00e9 les points de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner la majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Payment?\nR. Oui. Moi, je ne m\u2019occupais que de ma copie. L\u00e0, on a proclam\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Payment qui avait le prix. Ce n\u2019est pas tant le nombre de points comme les aptitudes qui l\u2019emportent\nPour expliquer ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, on pr\u00e9tendit que les membres du jury \u00e9taient ma\u00eetres du concours tant que le r\u00e9sultat n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 proclam\u00e9; le secr\u00e9taire exprima l\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore temps pour faire le changement; les membres du jury acquiesc\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette remarque; et le rapport du jury fut, en cons\u00e9quence, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 attribuant \u00e0 M. Payment le nombre de points ainsi modifi\u00e9 et qui lui donnait la majorit\u00e9.\nLe rapport fut transmis le soir m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, qui tenait sa r\u00e9union annuelle et qui, sur la foi du rapport, proclama Payment vainqueur du concours.\nMais voil\u00e0 que, quelques jours apr\u00e8s, le secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fit tenir \u00e0 chaque concurrent le d\u00e9tail des points qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s et que M. Edwin B\u00e9langer constata que, pour la dict\u00e9e musicale, le jury lui avait accord\u00e9 0, alors qu\u2019il avait bien conscience d\u2019avoir remis une copie presque parfaite. Il fit part de sa surprise \u00e0 son professeur, qui \u00e9tait en m\u00eame temps vice-pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique. Ce dernier pensa qu\u2019il ne pouvait y avoir d\u2019inconv\u00e9nient \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas erreur. Il en parla au pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie. On se procura la copie de B\u00e9langer et l\u2019on fut, en effet, d\u2019avis que cette copie \u00e9tait tellement satisfaisante que l\u2019attribution du chiffe 0 devenait inexplicable. La curiosit\u00e9 des membres de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie \u00e9tant ainsi \u00e9veill\u00e9e, ils pouss\u00e8rent plus loin leurs investigations et arriv\u00e8rent \u00e0 la conclusion que les bulletins remis par les membres du jury contenaient de telles erreurs qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019obtenir des explications. Ils pri\u00e8rent donc d\u2019abord le pr\u00e9sident du jury d\u2019en r\u00e9unir les membres pour permettre aux officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019\u00e9clairicir la situation. Le pr\u00e9sident du jury refusa, sur quoi le pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie les convoqua d\u2019office; et la r\u00e9union des membres du jury et des officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie eut lieu le 21 juillet 1932.\nDans l\u2019intervalle, le secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie avait pr\u00e9venu M. Payment de ne faire aucun pr\u00e9paratif pour son d\u00e9part pour l\u2019Europe \u201cvu certaines difficult\u00e9s survenues au sujet du prix\u201d.\nA la r\u00e9union du 21 juillet, \u00e0 laquelle assistaient quatre officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, les erreurs d\u00e9couvertes dans l\u2019attribution des points aux concurrents furent soumises aux membres du jury, qui \u00e9taient tous pr\u00e9sents. Il y fut clairement sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 que cette r\u00e9union \u00e9tait convoqu\u00e9e dans le but de faire une v\u00e9rification des points qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s par les juges\nafin de pouvoir fournir au gouvernement tous les renseignements qu\u2019il pourrait exiger d\u2019eux (les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie) en leur qualit\u00e9 de fid\u00e9icommis.\nL\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ne pr\u00e9tendait pas provoquer chez les membres du jury un changement d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation sur les m\u00e9rites de chaque concurrent; elle d\u00e9sirait seulement, comme il est dit dans le m\u00e9moire confidentiel qui leur fut communiqu\u00e9 et comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate dans la cause, savoir d\u2019eux s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas vraiment des erreurs dans le r\u00e9sultat \u201cd\u2019apr\u00e8s les chiffres m\u00eames des juges\u201d, lors du concours. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e du 21 juillet en fait foi. Le pr\u00e9sident y expliqua qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait\nd\u2019une rectification d\u2019erreurs et omissions commises par le jury lors des examens du 17 juin dernier.\nEt, en effet, s\u00e9ance tenante, les erreurs signal\u00e9es par les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie furent constat\u00e9es par les membres du jury. Elles furent inscrites au proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e. Les corrections qu\u2019elles comportaient furent faites; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, il fut \u00e9tabli que le v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9sultat du concours, bas\u00e9 sur les seuls chiffres exacts, \u00e9tait que M. Bernard Pich\u00e9, et non pas M. Jules Payment, avait obtenu le plus grand nombre de points.\nQue l\u2019on remarque que cette admission fut faite par les cinq membres du jury. Malgr\u00e9 cela, et apr\u00e8s que, v\u00e9rification \u00e9tant faite et le bulletin de chaque candidat \u00e9tant corrig\u00e9, le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9montrait que M. Bernard Pich\u00e9 avait obtenu 84.8 sur 100, alors que M. Jules Payment n\u2019avait obtenu que 76.9 sur 100 points, Ton voit que M. Morin s\u2019adressa alors aux quatre autres membres du jury et insista pour un remaniement des points en faveur de M. Payment, afin que la bourse lui f\u00fbt accord\u00e9e. On eut beau attirer son attention sur les prescriptions de la loi que c\u2019est \u201ccelui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de points\u201d qui a le droit d\u2019aller en Europe aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec; apr\u00e8s lecture de cet article de la loi, M. Morin persista quand m\u00eame pour accorder la bourse \u00e0 M. Payment; mais les quatre autres juges se prononc\u00e8rent en faveur de M. Pich\u00e9, qui avait obtenu le plus grand nombre de points. Puis le document fut sign\u00e9 par les membres du jury, y compris M. Morin, qui se trouva par l\u00e0 certifier le v\u00e9ritable nombre de points allou\u00e9s \u00e0 chacun des neuf candidats, mais qui crut devoir ajouter \u00e0 sa signature la note suivante:\nLeo-Pol Morin dissident, parce qu\u2019il maintient son jugement du 17 juin 1932 en faveur de Jules Payment.\nIl va sans dire que, comme r\u00e9sultat de cette rectification, M. Payment fut averti du changement survenu et qu\u2019il ne pouvait compter sur la bourse du prix d\u2019Europe pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0; et le secr\u00e9taire fut charg\u00e9 de faire rapport, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 l\u2019Honorable Secr\u00e9taire Provincial, dont cette question d\u00e9pend dans l\u2019administration du gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nC\u2019est dans ces conditions que l\u2019intim\u00e9 intenta devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure une action dirig\u00e9e contre l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec et contre chacun des membres du jury, mettant en cause, en plus, Bernard Pich\u00e9, son heureux concurrent, et l\u2019Honorable L.-A. Taschereau, Premier Ministre de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en sa qualit\u00e9 de Tr\u00e9sorier de la province, et l\u2019Honorable Athanase David, en sa qualit\u00e9 de Secr\u00e9taire de la province. Il produisit cependant plus tard un d\u00e9sistement de la mise en cause de MM. Taschereau et David.\nLes conclusions de l\u2019action \u00e9taient qu\u2019il fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait gagn\u00e9 le prix d\u2019Europe pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, comportant une bourse lui donnant le droit d\u2019aller, pendant deux ans, y parfaire ses \u00e9tudes musicales; \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ordre fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec de donner suite imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la proclamation (de l\u2019intim\u00e9) comme boursier du prix d\u2019Europe; \u00e0 ce que la revision, faite au sujet du verdict rendu le 17 juin 1932, soit annul\u00e9e et \u00e0 ce que le verdict soit maintenu; \u00e0 ce que les r\u00e9solutions, proc\u00e8s-verbaux, r\u00e8glements et autres \u00e9crits et documents se rapportant \u00e0 ce concours et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans le but d\u2019enlever ledit prix d\u2019Europe au demandeur soient annul\u00e9s et r\u00e9sili\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins futures que de droit; \u00e0 ce qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec de se conformer au jugement (\u00e0 \u00eatre rendu) dans la pr\u00e9sente cause dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze jours, le demandeur soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 parfaire ses \u00e9tudes musicales, pendant deux ans, en Europe, aux frais et d\u00e9pens de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec; \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de $5,000 \u00e0 titre de dommages; le tout avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens contre l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, la d\u00e9fenderesse, pour les raisons mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, et contre les autres parties, au cas de contestation de leur part seulement.\nBien naturellement, par son plaidoyer, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, \u00e0 laquelle se joignirent MM. Couture et Miro, nia que Payment f\u00fbt le gagnant de la bourse du prix d\u2019Europe pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932; elle affirma que la proclamation qui l\u2019avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 premier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par erreur et sur la foi de documents dont l\u2019inexactitude fut ensuite \u00e9tablie et reconnue, ajoutant que ce que Payment appelait la \u201crevision\u201d du 21 juillet 1932 n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9, en fait, qu\u2019une rectification provoqu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que l\u2019erreur dans la proclamation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte, dans le but d\u2019emp\u00eacher une injustice criante et pour pourvoir au redressement de justes griefs. Le v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019examen n\u2019y avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9, mais, au contraire, il y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9, apr\u00e8s le redressement d\u2019inexactitudes flagrantes. Comme cons\u00e9quence, le demandeur \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9, en fait et en droit, \u00e0 demander d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9tabli dans les pr\u00e9tendus droits qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais eus.\nLa cause proc\u00e9da devant l\u2019honorable Juge Philippe Demers, qui, devant les faits prouv\u00e9s et, en particulier, les omissions et les erreurs admises, pronon\u00e7a un jugement o\u00f9 il fait observer que\npar l\u2019article 2 du chapitre 139 S.R.P.Q. (Loi pour favoriser le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019art musical) le l\u00e9gislateur veut que celui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de points ait le droit d\u2019aller, aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, passer deux ans en Europe, pour y compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales; * * * que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, c\u2019est que ce prix soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 celui qui le m\u00e9rite, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen; que c\u2019est ainsi que le demandeur l\u2019interpr\u00e8te quand il demande \u00e0 la Cour, par ses conclusions, de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 le prix; * * * qu\u2019il est 19875\u20146\u00bd clairement \u00e9tabli que le meilleur examen \u00e9tait celui de Pich\u00e9; que c\u2019est par favoritisme qu\u2019un examinateur a accord\u00e9 au demandeur les points qui lui manquaient pour \u00eatre le premier; que le demandeur n\u2019avait pas gagn\u00e9 le prix d\u2019Europe et que la d\u00e9fenderesse a eu raison de le lui refuser, * * * que la d\u00e9fenderesse ne saurait \u00eatre tenue responsable de la fraude de quelques-uns des membres du jury et de l\u2019erreur des autres:\nEt, pour ces motifs, l\u2019honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u00e9bouta le demandeur de son action.\nLe r\u00e9sultat devant la Cour du Banc du Roi[2], o\u00f9 la cause fut port\u00e9e par Payment, fut assez peu satisfaisant. Le jugement de cette cour constate que l\u2019action est bien autoris\u00e9e par l\u2019article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile; mais il perd compl\u00e8tement de vue le v\u00e9ritable but et la vraie base de cette action qui est, d\u2019une part, de faire d\u00e9clarer que Payment a \u00e9t\u00e9 le vainqueur du prix d\u2019Europe de 1932 et qu\u2019il a droit comme tel de r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique la somme de $3,000 pour lui permettre d\u2019aller compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales en Europe pendant deux ans; ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de lui payer cette somme, d\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 y aller aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie; et, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la d\u00e9fense que Payment n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le v\u00e9ritable gagnant du concours mais qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 proclam\u00e9 par erreur, sur la foi d\u2019un rapport dont l\u2019inexactitude fut subs\u00e9quemment reconnue et \u00e9tablie. Le jugement se contente de d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019assembl\u00e9e du 21 juillet 1932 \u00e9tait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re parce que le jury \u00e9tait alors functus officio et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait plus le pouvoir de reviser son rapport; et il annule cette pr\u00e9tendue revision comme ill\u00e9gale et ultra vires. Le jugement ajoute que comme\nthere is nothing before this Court to show that the respondent, the Academy of Music of Quebec, will refuse to act upon the first verdict, now that the second verdict has been set aside,\nen cons\u00e9quence,\nreserving to the plaintiff all the rights accruing to him in virtue of the first verdict of the jury and the terms of the statute,\nil casse \u201cthe second verdict\u201d, rendu le 21 juillet 1932; il accorde au demandeur la somme de $1,000 \u00e0 titre de dommages\nfor the loss of pupils, the loss of his position with a radio company, for damages to his reputation, and for the loss of two years, at a very important time in the appellant\u2019s life, in completing his musical studies; mais oubliant que ces dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat des actes ill\u00e9gaux des membres du jury, et non le fait de l\u2019Academie, il condamne cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 les payer et il met tous les frais de Taction et de l\u2019appel conjointement et solidairement contre l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique et contre Couture et Miro, qui ont contest\u00e9. Au surplus, il laisse les parties dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant que l\u2019action ne f\u00fbt intent\u00e9e.\nCe jugement a pour effet de ne rien d\u00e9cider sur le point principal de l\u2019action de Payment; et, surtout, il ne tient aucun compte du fait que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique avait obtenu devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure un jugement par lequel elle \u00e9tait relev\u00e9e, \u00e0 cause du favoritisme et de la fraude de certains membres du jury et de l\u2019erreur des autres, de l\u2019obligation de payer \u00e0 Payment la somme de $3,000 et de l\u2019envoyer en Europe pour deux ans \u00e0 ses frais.\nSur ce dernier point, l\u2019un des juges, apr\u00e8s avoir exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que\nthere is, in my opinion, abundant evidence that Mr. Pich\u00e9 was, by the conduct of the jury, deprived of the award to which he was entitled;\nque \u201cMr. Bernier arbitrarily increased his figures\u201d; que \u201cthere can be little doubt but that Mr. Pich\u00e9 was unjustly treated\u201d, semble \u00eatre amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se rallier \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour parce que le droit de contester la validit\u00e9 du verdict n\u2019aurait appartenu qu\u2019\u00e0 M. Pich\u00e9, le concurrent qui \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement arriv\u00e9 le premier au concours:\nHad Mr. Pich\u00e9 attacked this award, I am inclined to believe that he might have been successful in having it declared that the procedure was illegal.\nMais il se range \u00e0 l\u2019avis exprim\u00e9 au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour par M. le juge Barclay\nthat the jury was, from the moment they made their first award, functus officio, that they had no power to revise their decision, and that, in consequence, the appeal should be allowed.\nQuant aux raisons donn\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 sur la m\u00eame question, elles se lisent comme suit, apr\u00e8s avoir fait allusion aux Consid\u00e9rants du juge de premi\u00e8re instance:\nFavoritism or fraud on the part of any of the jury does not confer upon the jury a power which no longer existed after it had rendered its verdict. As to whether or not these considerants are founded in fact, I do not need discuss, being of the opinion that under no circumstances could the jury revise its verdict. It may be for some other court to decide at the proper time and place as to whether the facts revealed show favoritism and fraud or a proper appreciation of the objects of the scholarship.\nC\u2019est comme cons\u00e9quence de ce raisonnement que l\u2019appel fut maintenu et que le jugement qui nous est maintenant soumis fut prononc\u00e9 dans le sens plus haut indiqu\u00e9. Nous avouons ne pas comprendre l\u2019importance que l\u2019on a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de savoir si les membres du jury pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ou non comme des arbitres et si, comme tels, ils avaient le pouvoir de reviser, le 21 juillet, le rapport qu\u2019ils avaient fait le 17 juin. Sur ce point, il y aurait certainement lieu, comme l\u2019ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 les procureurs des appelants devant la Cour Supr\u00eame, d\u2019examiner la port\u00e9e du jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Lacoste v. Cedar Rapids Manufacturing Company[3].\nDans cette affaire, comme on le sait, le Conseil Priv\u00e9, en \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la sentence arbitrale proc\u00e9dait d\u2019un point de vue erron\u00e9 de la loi, ordonna que la cause fut renvoy\u00e9e devant les m\u00eames arbitres pour qu\u2019ils prononcent une nouvelle sentence en tenant compte de la loi telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9finie dans le jugement du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire.\nMais admettons, pour les besoins de l\u2019argument, que le rapport du 21 juillet f\u00fbt un nouveau verdict, que le jury f\u00fbt functus officio et n\u2019e\u00fbt pas le pouvoir de le rendre.\nMettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce pr\u00e9tendu second verdict n\u2019avait pas pour effet de r\u00e9gler le litige. Cette conclusion, dans l\u2019action institu\u00e9e par Payment, n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un moyen subsidiaire pour arriver au v\u00e9ritable but de Payment: se faire d\u00e9clarer vainqueur du concours du 17 juin et faire reconna\u00eetre son droit aux $3,000 du prix d\u2019Europe. C\u2019est en cela que consistait le proc\u00e8s et pour cela qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, non seulement ne tranche pas cette question, qui est le vrai fond de la cause, mais il oublie que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l\u2019a jug\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique et que si, par ailleurs, les deux parties ont le droit d\u2019avoir une d\u00e9cision sur ce point (Code civil, art. 11), l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie a, pour sa part, un droit acquis au jugement qui a maintenu sa d\u00e9fense et qui a, par l\u00e0, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne devait pas \u00e0 Payment les $3,000 qu\u2019il r\u00e9clamait. La Cour du Banc du Roi devait se prononcer l\u00e0-dessus. Elle ne le faisait pas en \u00e9cartant tout simplement la s\u00e9ance du 21 juillet. Elle laissait par l\u00e0 subsister le verdict du 17 juin. Elle va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire que,\nnow that the second verdict has been set aside * * * there is nothing to show that * * * the Academy of Music of Quebec will refuse to act upon the first verdict. En tout respect, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le contraire qui est exact. La plaidoirie \u00e9crite de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie est l\u00e0, dans le dossier, qui all\u00e8gue que\nla proclamation (du nom de Payment, le 17 juin) a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par erreur, et sur la foi de documents dont l\u2019inexactitude a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et reconnue,\nqu\u2019elle refuse de donner effet au verdict \u201cdans le but d\u2019emp\u00eacher une injustice criante\u201d et des \u201cinexactitudes flagrantes\u201d; que\nle demandeur ne saurait \u00eatre \u201cr\u00e9tabli\u201d dans des droits qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais eus.\nC\u2019est ainsi que la contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9e. Bien plus, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action de Payment qui demandait la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution du verdict et, comme cons\u00e9quence, le versement des $3,000.\nDire que le jury n\u2019avait plus le pouvoir de rectifier son verdict, ce n\u2019est pas r\u00e9gler la question. C\u2019est \u00e9carter un des obstacles. Mais il reste que le verdict lui-m\u00eame est attaqu\u00e9, que sa validit\u00e9 et sa l\u00e9galit\u00e9 sont en jeu. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a le pouvoir et le droit d\u2019en constater la nullit\u00e9. Nous ne savons devant quelle autre cour l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie pourrait aller pour faire d\u00e9cider\nat the proper time and place whether the facts revealed show favouritism and fraud or a proper appreciation of the objects of the scholarship.\nToute cette question \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soulev\u00e9e devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 le lieu et le temps pour la discuter et pour la d\u00e9cider. Comme c\u2019est encore, devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, et devant nous, le lieu et le temps pour la trancher\u2014m\u00eame si la s\u00e9ance du jury, le 21 juillet, \u00e9tait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard inefficace.\nMais, comme cons\u00e9quence des faits que nous avons expos\u00e9s au commencement de ce jugement, nous ne consid\u00e9rons pas que les membres du jury, r\u00e9unis le 21 juillet, ont prononc\u00e9 un second verdict. Ils se sont alors content\u00e9s de constater des erreurs et des omissions dans le premier verdict. Ils les ont reconnues et admises; ils les ont consign\u00e9es dans un proc\u00e8s-verbal. Ils n\u2019ont pas rendu une nouvelle sentence; ils se sont born\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir rectifi\u00e9 les erreurs et les omissions dont le premier verdict \u00e9tait entach\u00e9, de faire rapport que ce premier verdict \u00e9tait inexact et que le v\u00e9ritable verdict qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu le 17 juin, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les points alors allou\u00e9s, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre un verdict en faveur de Bernard Pich\u00e9, et non pas un verdict en faveur de Payment, le demandeur-intim\u00e9. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu, ce jour-l\u00e0, de verdict qui avait \u00e0 \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et m\u00eame qui pouvait \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a eu qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s-verbal et un rapport constatant les erreurs du premier verdict. Qu\u2019on l\u2019envisage de quelque c\u00f4t\u00e9 que ce soit, on ne peut \u00e9viter que ce document constitue une admission de la part des membres du jury que le rapport fait le 17 juin 1932 \u00e9tait inexact et que la proclamation de Payment comme vainqueur du concours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par erreur, sur la foi d\u2019un rapport erron\u00e9, alors que, suivant les termes de la loi, \u201ccelui des concurrents qui avait obtenu le plus grand nombre de points\u201d aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre le gagnant. Celui qui avait r\u00e9ellement obtenu le plus grand nombre de points \u00e0 la suite du concours, c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Bernard Pich\u00e9.\nEn somme, il nous est vraiment indiff\u00e9rent que la r\u00e9union du 21 juillet ait eu lieu ou non, qu\u2019elle soit mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou qu\u2019elle ne le soit pas. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est que les erreurs et les ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s du concours, d\u00e9couvertes apr\u00e8s coup par les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, aient toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies dans la cause, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance les ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9es prouv\u00e9es et qu\u2019il les ait qualifi\u00e9es de favoritisme et de fraude. Le demandeur se retranche derri\u00e8re une question de plaidoirie et soumet devant cette Cour que le favoritisme et la fraude n\u2019\u00e9taient pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Le plaidoyer, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019erreur du verdict et de la proclamation r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une \u201cinjustice criante\u201d et d\u2019\u201cinexactitudes flagrantes\u201d. Tous les faits sur lesquels le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure s\u2019est bas\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate sans objection de la partie adverse. Entre une \u201cinjustice criante\u201d et le favoritisme il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une nuance. Entre des \u201cinexactitudes flagrantes\u201d et la fraude la distance n\u2019est pas longue \u00e0 parcourir. Et qu\u2019est-ce que le favoritisme, si ce n\u2019est une des nombreuses formes que rev\u00eat la fraude? D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019erreur dans laquelle l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie a \u00e9t\u00e9 induite est clairement invoqu\u00e9e, et la cause de cette erreur, c\u2019est la fraude et le favoritisme de quelques-uns des membres du jury. Le r\u00e9sultat tr\u00e8s clair de cette erreur, c\u2019est que ce n\u2019est pas M. Payment qui, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, a obtenu \u201cle plus grand nombre de points\" lors du concours. Et il s\u2019ensuit que, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute autre consid\u00e9ration, M. Payment n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 sa cause, et que, cons\u00e9quemment, son action ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenue. Dans les circonstances, pourquoi refuserait-on \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique le droit de m\u00e9conna\u00eetre le rapport d\u2019un jury qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu erron\u00e9 et inexact? Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e, par un acte du parlement de Qu\u00e9bec, le fid\u00e9i-commissaire des fonds publics octroy\u00e9s par lui pour le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019art musical et charg\u00e9e de voir \u00e0 ce que le prix d\u2019Europe f\u00fbt accord\u00e9 \u00e0 \u201ccelui des concurrents qui obtenait le plus grand nombre de points\u201d lors du concours sp\u00e9cial qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u mission d\u2019organiser. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc, non seulement son droit, mais son devoir, d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait inform\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une erreur, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 faire toutes les investigations n\u00e9cessaires pour se rendre compte de l\u2019exactitude de son information et de l\u2019existence de cette erreur. Quel moyen plus juste et plus efficace pouvait-elle employer \u00e0 cette fin que celui auquel elle a eu recours de convoquer les membres du jury, de leur soumettre la nature de ses informations et d\u2019obtenir d\u2019eux les explications requises pour constater si, oui ou non, ces erreurs et ces inexactitudes existaient, avec le r\u00e9sultat, dans le cas actuel, que les membres du jury eux-m\u00eames ont admis que le rapport du 17 juin 1932 \u00e9tait inexact et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la loi en vertu de laquelle, seule, M. Payment pouvait r\u00e9clamer la bourse d\u2019Europe?\nNous ne voulons pas entrer dans les d\u00e9tails de la preuve qui, \u00e0 notre point de vue, justifiait pleinement la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9 l\u2019honorable Juge Demers. Nous nous contentons de faire remarquer que la loi exige un jury compos\u00e9 de cinq membres; que l\u2019esprit de cette loi est \u00e9videmment que chaque membre du jury doit se prononcer sur le m\u00e9rite de chaque examen; que les membres du jury n\u2019ont pas le droit de s\u2019en rapporter, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ici, \u00e0 la seule d\u00e9cision d\u2019un d\u2019entre eux sur la valeur des examens \u00e9crits; et que, de ce seul chef, l\u2019on serait en droit de conclure qu\u2019un concours conduit de cette fa\u00e7on n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention du parlement.\nMais nous ajouterons que tous les faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont quelques-uns des membres du jury ont fini par octroyer \u00e0 Payment un nombre de points suffisant pour lui permettre d\u2019arriver premier et, en particulier, cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019augmenter les points de Payment apr\u00e8s que les bulletins de chaque membre du jury avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au secr\u00e9taire et par cons\u00e9quent, apr\u00e8s que chacun d\u2019eux pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant arr\u00eat\u00e9 le nombre de points qu\u2019il octroyait, nous para\u00eet suffisamment r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible pour que l\u2019on ne soit pas surpris que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance l\u2019ait qualifi\u00e9e de favoritisme. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici, en effet, d\u2019un doute sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, car nous avons l\u2019admission du membre du jury lui-m\u00eame. Il n\u2019a pas ajout\u00e9 apr\u00e8s coup \u00e0 son bulletin un certain nombre de points suppl\u00e9mentaires parce qu\u2019il croyait consciencieusement que le concurrent les m\u00e9ritait; mais, de son propre aveu, parce qu\u2019il voulait lui donner les points qu\u2019il lui fallait pour arriver premier. Sur la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il a faite en cour, on serait justifiable de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 lui donner n\u2019importe quel nombre de points dans le but d\u2019arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat.\nNous ne croyons pas devoir insister sur la th\u00e9orie pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par M. Morin, ainsi qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e au commencement de ce jugement; et il est suffisant, suivant le langage du Palais, de la laisser parler par elle-m\u00eame.\nEn outre de ces diff\u00e9rentes consid\u00e9rations, il n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019une des erreurs constat\u00e9es lors de la r\u00e9union du 21 juillet, c\u2019est que M. Morin, qui a corrig\u00e9 les examens \u00e9crits, avait ensuite dict\u00e9 aux autres membres du jury les points qu\u2019il avait accord\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque concurrent. Ces points avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits par lui sur chaque copie d\u2019examen. Sur la mati\u00e8re de l\u2019harmonie \u00e9crite, il y avait, comme on s\u2019en souvient, deux parties: la basse chiffr\u00e9e et le chant donn\u00e9. Pich\u00e9 avait remis sa copie sur deux feuilles: une pour le chant donn\u00e9 et l\u2019autre pour la basse chiffr\u00e9e. Sur la premi\u00e8re feuille, quatre points avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits, et cinq points sur la seconde feuille. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, lorsque le r\u00e9sultat fut dict\u00e9 aux autres examinateurs, ou bien, par m\u00e9prise, Morin n\u2019aurait dict\u00e9 qu\u2019un des chiffres, ou bien les autres n\u2019en auraient compris qu\u2019un. Toujours est-il que sur les bulletins il y eut erreur dans le chiffre qui aurait d\u00fb r\u00e9ellement \u00eatre inscrit pour Pich\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der, Pich\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb avoir le m\u00eame nombre de points pour cet examen de l\u2019harmonie \u00e9crite sur chacun des bulletins, puisque la note accord\u00e9e provenait du seul M. Morin; et cependant, par suite d\u2019un malentendu, au lieu de 9 que Pich\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb avoir, comme trois des membres du jury n\u2019\u00e9crivirent que le chiffre 4, la moyenne ou le pourcentage lui donna. seulement 5.9. Il y avait l\u00e0 une omission de 3.1 qui, \u00e0 elle seule, \u00e9tait, suffisante pour changer le r\u00e9sultat du concours et pour donner encore \u201cle plus grand nombre de points\u201d \u00e0 Pich\u00e9, nonobstant l\u2019addition que M. Bernier crut devoir faire aux points de Payment apr\u00e8s que son bulletin avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au secr\u00e9taire. C\u2019est, entre autres, \u00e0 cette constatation que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait allusion lorsque, dans son jugement, il dit que la proclamation du 17 juin a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019erreur des membres du jury.\nDans les circonstances, va-t-on pr\u00e9tendre que Payment, malgr\u00e9 les erreurs constat\u00e9es et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es et malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ellement obtenu le plus grand nombre de points, devait quand m\u00eame recevoir les fonds de la province de Qu\u00e9bec des mains de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique et partir pour l\u2019Europe aux frais de cette derni\u00e8re? Il ne nous para\u00eet pas discutable que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie avait \u00e0 la fois le devoir et le droit de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 cette cons\u00e9quence et que Pich\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le seul \u00e0 pouvoir porter plainte \u00e0 ce sujet.\nComme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, nous n\u2019avons pas besoin de nous demander, au cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9union du 21 juillet e\u00fbt r\u00e9ellement eu cet objet, si les membres du jury, ce jour-l\u00e0, ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre un second verdict et s\u2019ils avaient encore le pouvoir de le faire. Il nous suffit de savoir qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence ils ont constat\u00e9 et reconnu leur erreur. On ne saurait admettre que, l\u2019erreur une fois constat\u00e9e, la situation f\u00fbt sans rem\u00e8de et que, comme l\u2019ont pr\u00e9tendu les procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision rendue le 17 juin \u00e9tait finale et sans appel.\nSupposons le cas o\u00f9, dans un concours de ce genre, r\u00e9gi par des conditions statutaires semblables \u00e0 celles de la loi dont il s\u2019agit ici, le fiduciaire, investi du devoir d\u2019attribuer un prix pay\u00e9 sur les fonds publics, d\u00e9couvrirait, apr\u00e8s la proclamation d\u2019un candidat comme gagnant de ce concours que ce candidat s\u2019est rendu coupable de plagiat. Il serait inadmissible que le fiduciaire f\u00fbt li\u00e9 irr\u00e9vocablement par le verdict et par la proclamation et qu\u2019il f\u00fbt quand m\u00eame oblig\u00e9 de verser l\u2019argent au plagiaire.\nRapprochons-nous davantage du concours qui nous occupe. Prenons le cas d\u2019Edwin B\u00e9langer, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 dans cette cause-ci. Nous avons commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 en parler au d\u00e9but de ce jugement. B\u00e9langer, recevant le d\u00e9tail des points qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s, s\u2019aper\u00e7oit qu\u2019il a obtenu 0 pour la dict\u00e9e musicale qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8glements du concours, comportait un maximum de 15 points. Il attire l\u2019attention des officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie sur ce qui lui para\u00eet \u00eatre une erreur \u00e9vidente. Les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie prennent connaissance de sa copie et trouvent, comme lui, que le chiffre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 est injustifiable. Les bulletins des cinq membres du jury lui ont accord\u00e9 0, toujours en vertu de cette m\u00e9thode qui avait confi\u00e9 la correction des examens \u00e9crits au seul M. Morin et qui leur avait fait transcrire sur chacun de leurs bulletins le chiffre accord\u00e9 par M. Morin. Le 21 juillet, lorsque les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie saisissent de la question les membres du jury tous sont d\u2019accord pour admettre qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 une inexactitude flagrante, et voici comment le proc\u00e8s-verbal consigne l\u2019explication de cette erreur:\nM. Morin, qui avait corrig\u00e9 ces devoirs, d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit sur la copie de B\u00e9langer, par erreur, le chiffre 0 qu\u2019il voulait mettre sur une autre copie, laquelle ne valait rien. M. Bernier donne la m\u00eame explication.\nCette explication est inqualifiable et la co\u00efncidence qui voudrait que M. Morin et M. Bernier aient tous deux commis une substitution aussi exceptionnelle est v\u00e9ritablement incroyable. On fr\u00e9mit \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e que des jeunes gens qui se soumettent \u00e0 un examen ou \u00e0 un concours puissent \u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un accident de ce genre. En cette circonstance tous les membres du jury convinrent que M. B\u00e9langer avait droit \u00e0 13 points pour cette mati\u00e8re. Mais la question sur laquelle nous voulons surtout insister, en donnant cet exemple tir\u00e9 du concours lui-m\u00eame, est la suivante: s\u2019il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 que, par suite de cette rectification, B\u00e9langer f\u00fbt devenu le candidat qui avait obtenu le plus grand nombre de points, y a-t-il lieu de douter pour un seul instant que le devoir de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de lui accorder le prix et qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9e de le faire sous pr\u00e9texte que le verdict erron\u00e9 du 17 juin \u00e9tait final et que ni l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, ni aucun pouvoir constitu\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt eu le droit d\u2019y porter rem\u00e8de.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9clare dans son jugement, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est venu d\u00e9fendre devant cette Cour, que \u201cthe action is within the scope of article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d Si l\u2019action \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce que l\u2019on a appel\u00e9 le second verdict et si la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par cet article du code, avait juridiction pour le d\u00e9clarer nul, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle avait ce m\u00eame pouvoir et cette m\u00eame juridiction pour se prononcer souverainement sur la validit\u00e9 et la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du premier verdict.\nL\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique aurait eu le droit, si c\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, d\u2019intenter une action pour faire annuler ce premier verdict. Elle avait m\u00eame le devoir d\u2019intenter cette action comme fid\u00e9icommissaire du parlement et \u00e0 raison de la mission qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7ue d\u2019octroyer des fonds publics suivant des conditons d\u00e9finies par la loi. Ce qu\u2019elle pouvait faire valoir par voie d\u2019action, elle pouvait tout aussi bien le faire valoir par voie de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019action prise par Payment pour se faire octroyer ces fonds, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas droit.\nC\u2019est ce que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec a fait. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance lui a donn\u00e9 raison; et nous sommes d\u2019avis que ce jugement \u00e9tait parfaitement bien fond\u00e9.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 le jugement qui d\u00e9clare erron\u00e9 le verdict du 17 juin 1932 comme n\u2019\u00e9tant ni conforme aux faits, ni conforme \u00e0 la loi en vertu de laquelle le concours a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu, cette Cour pourrait quand m\u00eame confirmer la condamnation aux dommages prononc\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi contre l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, \u00e0 raison du tort que toute cette affaire a caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nNous admettons, en effet, que le sort de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est regrettable. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime innocente d\u2019une erreur grave et qui \u00e9tait certainement de nature \u00e0 lui infliger injustement des dommages consid\u00e9rables.\nMais ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de ce dommage. L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique a agi sur la foi du rapport des membres du jury. Elle a agi de bonne foi et dans l\u2019ignorance des erreurs et des omissions qui affectaient ce rapport.\nLes membres du jury n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ses mandataires, ou ses agents, dans le sens qu\u2019ils pouvaient engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 pour les actes qu\u2019ils ont commis. C\u2019est encore ce que d\u00e9cide avec raison le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance en disant que \u201cla d\u00e9fenderesse ne saurait \u00eatre tenue responsable\u201d des agissements et de l\u2019erreur des membres du jury. Les membres du jury constituaient un corps ind\u00e9pendant nomm\u00e9 en vertu de la loi. C\u2019est \u00e0 eux, ou \u00e0 tout le moins \u00e0 quelques-uns d\u2019entre eux, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb s\u2019attaquer pour la compensation de ses griefs. Il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos, dans les conclusions de son action, de r\u00e9clamer des dommages d\u2019autres personnes que de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec. Nous ne pourrions donc lui accorder au del\u00e0 de ce qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9.\nPour toutes ces raisons, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu. Dans les conditions que nous avons expos\u00e9es, le verdict tel que rendu et proclam\u00e9 le 17 juin 1932 \u00e9tait absolument nul; et les tribunaux, constatant cette nullit\u00e9, doivent refuser d\u2019y donner effet. Il s\u2019ensuit que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens, tant devant cette Cour que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nCannon J. (dissenting):\u2014Le renvoi de l\u2019action par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est bas\u00e9 sur les Consid\u00e9rants suivants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que par l\u2019article 2 du chapitre 139 S.R.P.Q., le l\u00e9gislateur veut que celui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de points ait le droit d\u2019aller, aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, passer deux ans en Europe, pour y compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, c\u2019est que le prix soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 celui qui le m\u00e9rite, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen; que c\u2019est ainsi que le demandeur l\u2019interpr\u00e8te quand il demande \u00e0 la Cour, par ses conclusions, de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 le prix;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il est clairement \u00e9tabli que le meilleur examen \u00e9tait celui de Pich\u00e9; que c\u2019est par favoritisme qu\u2019un examinateur a accord\u00e9 au demandeur les points qui lui manquaient pour \u00eatre le premier; que le demandeur n\u2019a pas gagn\u00e9 le prix d\u2019Europe et que la d\u00e9fenderesse a eu raison de le lui refuser;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9fenderesse ne saurait \u00eatre tenue responsable de la fraude de quelques-uns des membres du jury et de l\u2019erreur des autres;\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter ces conclusions et a cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 le second verdict qu\u2019un jury sp\u00e9cial, qui avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 ses pouvoirs le 17 juin 1932, aurait rendu le 21 juillet 1932, et condamn\u00e9 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 $1,000 de dommages, r\u00e9servant \u00e0 ce dernier tous ses droits en vertu du premier verdict des examinateurs aux termes du statut. C\u2019est ce dernier jugement, accept\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, que les appelants nous demandent de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nNous ne devons pas perdre de vue qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un litige entre Payment et l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, et non pas entre Payment et Pich\u00e9 qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre proclam\u00e9 gagnant du prix d\u2019Europe. La Cour du Banc du Roi a-t-elle eu raison, vu la contestation li\u00e9e et la preuve faite, de conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique envers Payment?\nIl est admis de part et d\u2019autre que ce dernier \u00e9tait en tous points qualifi\u00e9 pour \u00eatre candidat au concours annuel organis\u00e9 en vertu du statut par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 l\u2019examen au lieu, au temps et de la mani\u00e8re voulus par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, cette derni\u00e8re, dans sa s\u00e9ance solennelle, \u00e9tant la seule assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, le proclama urbi et orbi gagnant de ce prix d\u2019Europe lui assurant, aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, un s\u00e9jour de deux, et possiblement de trois ans, sur le Vieux Continent pour parfaire des \u00e9tudes musicales.

J.-Arthur Paquet, tr\u00e9sorier de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, alla en arri\u00e8re de ce document officiel, hors la pr\u00e9sence des membres du jury et des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, par une enqu\u00eate secr\u00e8te, en scrutant les bulletins de vote des membres du jury et m\u00eame les copies des candidats. Il est inutile pour moi d\u2019entrer dans les d\u00e9tails des \u00e9v\u00e9nements subs\u00e9quents, qui sont fournis compl\u00e8tement dans les notes tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9es de mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019honorable juge Rinfret.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est la suivante:\nLes membres du jury, lorsqu\u2019ils rendirent leur verdict sur les diff\u00e9rents bulletins de vote, ont-ils, oui ou non, r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement le m\u00e9rite des diff\u00e9rents candidats qui avaient subi l\u2019examen, tant oral qu\u2019\u00e9crit; et, surtout, M. Bernier, pr\u00e9sident du jury et l\u2019un des trois repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, a-t-il agi \u00e0 la connaissance, avec le consentement et comme le repr\u00e9sentant des autres examinateurs, lorsqu\u2019il a ajout\u00e9 cinq points, sur la suggestion de M. J.-Arthur Paquet, \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019il avait d\u2019abord inscrits sur son bulletin, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour \u201cR\u00e9pertoire\u201d 22 au lieu de 20, et \u201cPi\u00e8ce impos\u00e9e\u201d 20 au lieu de 17? M. Paquet, comme t\u00e9moin des d\u00e9fendeurs, dans son examen en chef, explique l\u2019incident comme suit:\nM. Bernier est venu me trouver et m\u2019a dit: \u201cMonsieur Paquet, combien faudrait-il que j\u2019augmente mon bulletin pour que je donne une majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 Payment?\u201d\nJe lui ai dit: \u201cIl lui faudrait absolument une unit\u00e9; il faudrait que votre bulletin soit augment\u00e9 de cinq points afin que la moyenne divis\u00e9e par cinq donne une unit\u00e9.\u201d Si tous les juges avaient augment\u00e9 d\u2019un point, tr\u00e8s bien, mais il y avait seulement un qui augmentait; il fallait qu\u2019il augment\u00e2t de cinq points afin d\u2019avoir une moyenne d\u2019un point.\nQ. Afin que le chiffre 5 divis\u00e9 par le nombre 5 rapporte une unit\u00e9 de plus?\nR. Oui, c\u2019est cela. M. Bernier m\u2019a dit: \u201cJe veux bien le faire, je veux \u00eatre en bons termes avec la famille Gagnon, je consens \u00e0 changer mon bulletin.\u201d Alors, j\u2019ai dit \u00e0 M. Bernier: \u201cTu as le droit de le faire, le jugement final n\u2019est pas rendu, vous \u00eates \u00e0 discuter sur la valeur des candidats, etc.; pour moi, je crois que tu as droit de le faire, mais regardes-y \u00e0 deux fois.\u201d\nC\u2019est alors que le bulletin que vous verrez ici et sur lequel \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 78.5 points est devenu 83.5 points.\nLe pr\u00e9sident du jury, M. J.-Arthur Bernier, en r\u00e9ponse aux questions pos\u00e9es par la Cour, lors de son examen en chef, explique la situation comme suit:\nMaintenant, lors du concours du prix d\u2019Europe, le dix-sept (17) juin, nous arrivons en majorit\u00e9 pour M. Pich\u00e9. M. Couture, M. Raoul Paquet * * *\nPar la Cour:\nQ. Le dix-sept (17)?\nR. Oui, lors du concours m\u00eame. L\u00e0 je reviens au concours du mois de juin. Alors, nous arrivions quatre pour M. Pich\u00e9 et un, M. Morin, pour M. Payment. Il y avait tr\u00e8s peu de diff\u00e9rence, du moins pour ce qui me regarde. Je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait 81.9 \u00e0 81.1.\nQ. Gomment se fait-il que vous \u00e9tiez pour Pich\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 proclam\u00e9? Vous \u00e9tiez quatre pour Pich\u00e9 et vous ne l\u2019avez pas proclam\u00e9?\nR. Parce que, avant de faire la proclamation, il y a eu la discussion qui existe toujours avant de proclamer l\u2019\u00e9lu. M. Morin a d\u2019abord commenc\u00e9 par dire: \u201cEnfin, pour moi, c\u2019est M. Payment.\u201d Alors, M. Morin qui, \u00e0 mon sens,-\u2014j\u2019exprime mon opinion,\u2014est une autorit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re musicale, a \u00e9mis cette th\u00e9orie qu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9velopper le musicien avant le technicien. J\u2019ai rest\u00e9 quelque peu surpris. Mais tout de m\u00eame, comme je me suis toujours efforc\u00e9, surtout en mati\u00e8re musicale, de ne pas montrer un esprit ferm\u00e9 aux convictions, surtout quand je sais que c\u2019est un homme \u00e9minemment sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 moi qui me donne des conseils et quand je sais que sa parole est infiniment plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e que la mienne, je me soumets. Alors, la discussion a continu\u00e9 toujours. * ** *\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez tous des juges \u00e9gaux en pouvoirs?\nR. Non. Je ne crois pas. * * *\nQ. Vous n\u2019aviez pas la m\u00eame responsabilit\u00e9?\nR. Oui, mais on n\u2019avait pas les m\u00eames talents, du moins pour ce qui me regarde. Sans fausse humilit\u00e9, j\u2019aime mieux me mettre le dernier des membres du jury. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019ayant foi en la parole de M. Morin * * * Quelque temps apr\u00e8s aussi, M. Raoul Paquet, qui parle tr\u00e8s sagement et sens\u00e9ment, disait: \u201cA mon sens, M. Pich\u00e9 a fait ce qu\u2019il a pu. Il est arriv\u00e9, je crois, au bout, au maximum de ses capacit\u00e9s, et quand bien m\u00eame il irait passer un ou deux ans l\u00e0-bas, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il serait beaucoup plus fort en revenant. Tandis que M. Payment est un jeune, il n\u2019a que 22 ans, il a le temps de parfaire * * *\u201d\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que cela avait \u00e0 faire avec la question des points de chacun? Il s\u2019agissait de savoir qui avait pass\u00e9 le concours, vous n\u2019aviez pas d\u2019affaire \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qui devait \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 en Europe, vous aviez \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qui avait gagn\u00e9 le concours, c\u2019\u00e9tait le nombre de points qui importait.\nR. Les notes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9es, il restait bien des petites choses \u00e0 r\u00e9gler. Et alors, M. Raoul Paquet a dit ce que je viens de vous dire. La discussion a continu\u00e9 surtout entre M. Morin et M. Couture. Enfin, on a laiss\u00e9 parler beaucoup M. Morin. Comme pr\u00e9sident du jury, j\u2019ai dit: \u201cMessieurs, je fais parler M. Morin parce que je le consid\u00e8re comme expert en la mati\u00e8re.\u201d C\u2019\u00e9tait mon opinion. Et alors nous avons continu\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter. Enfin nous sommes venus d\u2019accord que nous pouvions, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la th\u00e9orie que M. Morin avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e surtout, qu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9velopper le musicien avant le technicien et nous avons donn\u00e9 le prix \u00e0 M. Payment, sans \u00e9gard aux points qui pouvaient marquer une majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Pich\u00e9. Parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas les points comme l\u2019opinion que nous gardions de M. Payment, surtout, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9saccord de M. Morin. Alors, pour ma part, j\u2019avais, je suppose, 81.1\u2014pour que mes points donnent une majorit\u00e9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019augmenter chaque copie.\nQ. Alors, vous les avez augment\u00e9es?\nR. Nous avons augment\u00e9.\nPar Me Arthur Vall\u00e9e, C.R., procureur des d\u00e9fendeurs:\nQ. \u201cNous avons augment\u00e9\u201d ou \u201cj\u2019ai augment\u00e9\u201d?\nR. J\u2019ai augment\u00e9.\nQ. Vous \u00eates le seul \u00e0 avoir augment\u00e9?\nR. Nous arrivions d\u2019accord d\u2019abord.\nPar la Cour:\nQ. Vous avez augment\u00e9 les points de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner la majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Payment? R. Oui. Moi, je ne m\u2019occupais que de ma copie. L\u00e0, on a proclam\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Payment qui avait le prix. Ce n\u2019est pas tant le nombre de points comme les aptitudes qui l\u2019emporte.\nMe Arthur Vall\u00e9e, C.R.: Je m\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette preuve, ceci \u00e9tant une question d\u2019opinion.\nR. (Continuant) M. Payment a \u00e9t\u00e9 proclam\u00e9 vainqueur l\u00e0 et le soir, \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on a annonc\u00e9 la chose. Moi, remarquez bien que je n\u2019\u00e9tais absolument ni pour l\u2019un, ni pour l\u2019autre. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire je ne penchais pas plus pour l\u2019un que pour l\u2019autre. Je ne pouvais pas faire cela, j\u2019aurais eu une conscience absolument indigne en faisant une telle chose, parce que la responsabilit\u00e9 du prix d\u2019Europe m\u2019a toujours effray\u00e9.\nPendant que nous \u00e9tions en assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale on a proclam\u00e9 le vainqueur. On a demand\u00e9 de faire entrer les journalistes, ils sont entr\u00e9s. On leur a demand\u00e9\u2014pour moi, on leur a demand\u00e9\u2014s\u2019ils voulaient bien annoncer le r\u00e9sultat du concours. Et un de mes confr\u00e8res a demand\u00e9 m\u00eame, pour faire plaisir \u00e0 la famille: Est-ce que l\u2019on ne pourrait pas le faire annoncer \u00e0 la radio? Tout le monde a dit: Oui.\nPar Me Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9rard, C.R., procureur du demandeur:\nQ. Maintenant, monsieur Bernier, M. J. A. Paquet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 hier sur serment que vous lui aviez dit: \u201cJe veux \u00eatre bien avec la famille Gagnon, la famille de M. Henri Gagnon. et je vais donner le prix \u00e0 Payment\u201d?\nR. Ah! jamais de la vie. Ah! jamais de la vie. Ah! lala, c\u2019est renversant. Nous \u00e9tions l\u00e0 tous dans l\u2019assembl\u00e9e, il aurait fallu que je parte de ma place pour aller trouver M. Paquet. Je le nie positivement, cela.\nIl me faut conclure, en pr\u00e9sence de ces t\u00e9moignages, que le r\u00e9sultat proclam\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas entach\u00e9 d\u2019erreur, tel que plaid\u00e9 par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie; c\u2019\u00e9tait bien l\u2019opinion solide et, apr\u00e8s discussion, unanime du jury, telle que rapport\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s-verbal, qui fut communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec et proclam\u00e9e en s\u00e9ance solennelle. Jusque-l\u00e0 il ne saurait \u00eatre question d\u2019erreur. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e9tait conforme aux bulletins de vote des examinateurs; et l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie n\u2019a pas, par erreur, proclam\u00e9 Payment comme ayant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le jury, obtenu le plus grand nombre de points tant sur l\u2019examen \u00e9crit que sur l\u2019examen pratique et oral.\nLe chapitre 139 des Statuts Refondus de 1925 dit qu\u2019une subvention annuelle de $5,000 est sujette aux conditions suivantes:\n1. Ouverture chaque ann\u00e9e par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019un concours sp\u00e9cial pour le chant, le piano, l\u2019orgue, le violon ou le violoncelle;\n2. Les concurrents sont jug\u00e9s par un jury sp\u00e9cial nomm\u00e9 par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique. Ce jury doit \u00eatre compos\u00e9 de cinq membres dont deux doivent \u00eatre pris en dehors des membres de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie; et\n3. Celui des concurrents qui obtient le plus grand nombre de points a le droit, aux frais de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Qu\u00e9bec, d\u2019aller passer deux ans en Europe pour y compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes musicales.\nPour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, l\u2019unique concours du Prix d\u2019Europe annuel pr\u00e9vu par la loi fut organis\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, tenue le 8 juin 1932. Les deux juges \u00e9trangers \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, M. L\u00e9o-Pol Morin et M. Henri Miro, furent nomm\u00e9s juges du prix d\u2019Europe et M. J.-Arthur Bernier, comme membre de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, devant agir avec deux coll\u00e8gues de Montr\u00e9al. Le seul examen officiel est donc celui tenu les 16 et 17 juin 1932. Le demandeur s\u2019en tient au document officiel portant le sceau de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u apr\u00e8s la proclamation du 17 juin et pr\u00e9tend que les proc\u00e9dures subs\u00e9quentes qui ont eu pour effet de changer le r\u00e9sultat du concours en substituant comme laur\u00e9at du prix d\u2019Europe M. Pich\u00e9 sont ill\u00e9gales et nulles et que le jury, apr\u00e8s avoir rendu sa d\u00e9cision en toute libert\u00e9, \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9pourvu de toute autorit\u00e9, functus officio et n\u2019avait plus aucun pouvoir pour reviser ou changer sa d\u00e9cision. Son jugement \u00e9tait acquis au demandeur et ne pouvait \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 que par l\u2019effet des seules voies admises par la loi. Le statut ne pourvoit \u00e0 aucun appel au comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ou aux membres du jury individuellement ou collectivement. Les pouvoirs du tribunal \u00e9taient \u00e9puis\u00e9s et l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, par l\u2019entremise de ses officiers ou par une r\u00e9union sp\u00e9ciale du jury, ne pouvait si\u00e9ger en appel de cette d\u00e9cision. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ne pouvait pas se substituer \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour exercer elle-m\u00eame le droit de r\u00e9forme et de surveillance, et le contr\u00f4le confi\u00e9s \u00e0 ce tribunal par l\u2019article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile. Si les officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie croyaient avoir d\u00e9couvert des circonstances qui justifiaient l\u2019intervention de la Cour pour r\u00e9former le verdict de son jury, elle aurait pu prendre l\u2019action voulue et mettre en cause le demandeur et les juges accus\u00e9s d\u2019erreur ou de partialit\u00e9. Mais elle ne pouvait juger elle-m\u00eame le litige et encore moins forcer, comme elle l\u2019a fait, les membres du jury \u00e0 si\u00e9ger de nouveau en appel de certaines de leurs d\u00e9cisions. Sur ce point, sans aller aussi loin que la Cour du Banc du Roi et sans assimiler les fonctions d\u2019un jury d\u2019examinateurs \u00e0 celles d\u2019arbitr\u00e9s, je partage cependant l\u2019opinion de la Cour du Banc du Roi que les proc\u00e9dures subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des jur\u00e9s dans les circonstances ci-dessus relat\u00e9es et \u00e0 la proclamation solennelle du prix d\u2019Europe sont ill\u00e9gales et ne sauraient entacher de nullit\u00e9 le certificat d\u00e9cern\u00e9 par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie au demandeur quant au nombre de points obtenus lors du seul concours r\u00e9gulier permis par la loi. Toute la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour prouver les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s plus ou moins recommandables des membres du jury choisi par l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ne saurait en aucune fa\u00e7on affecter le demandeur Payment. Pour s\u2019excuser de lui avoir caus\u00e9 des dommages \u00e9vidents, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ne peut faire valoir\u2014ce qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ussi, sans m\u00eame l\u2019avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e0 faire qualifier par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance de fraude, de favoritisme et ne saurait ainsi invoquer la pr\u00e9tendue turpitude de ses propres agents. S\u2019il y a eu des fautes d\u2019omission ou de commission, elle, et non Payment, doit en porter la responsabilit\u00e9; elle doit r\u00e9parer le dommage caus\u00e9 par ses tergiversations subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 un candidat parfaitement qualifi\u00e9 et qui s\u2019est en tout conform\u00e9 aux exigences de la loi.\nCette pratique d\u2019admettre l\u2019examen, par des enqu\u00eates subs\u00e9quentes, des griefs plus ou moins fond\u00e9s de candidats d\u00e9sappoint\u00e9s par les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un concours, ne saurait \u00eatre encourag\u00e9e et n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pas pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Rien dans le statut n\u2019autorise l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique \u00e0 mettre en doute et \u00e0 discuter apr\u00e8s coup le verdict rendu par le jury de son choix ou \u00e0 accorder comme des esp\u00e8ces de prix de consolation. C\u2019est \u00e0 elle d\u2019organiser d\u2019avance le concours convenablement et de confier l\u2019examen \u00e0 des personnes qui, une fois choisies, doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es dignes de confiance et capables de rendre justice \u00e0 ceux qui se pr\u00e9sentent comme candidats.\nPich\u00e9, le principal int\u00e9ress\u00e9, n\u2019a jamais port\u00e9 plainte, ni \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, ni au tribunal. Bien que mis en cause par le demandeur, il n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ses conclusions demandant \u00e0 ce que le verdict du jury, rendu le 17 juin 1932, f\u00fbt respect\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, les officiers du nouveau bureau de direction \u00e9lu \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re date ont fait preuve d\u2019un z\u00e8le intempestif qui a peut-\u00eatre eu pour r\u00e9sultat de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier le m\u00e9rite de ceux que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie avait charg\u00e9s de conduire l\u2019examen de 1932 mais ne saurait avoir pour r\u00e9sultat de faire perdre au demandeur le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du prix d\u2019Europe que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie elle-m\u00eame lui avait d\u00e9cern\u00e9, encore une fois sans aucune erreur de la part du jury.\nLe dossier d\u00e9montre que les points accord\u00e9s \u00e0 Payment l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en toute libert\u00e9, apr\u00e8s une discussion de tous les membres du jury, en pr\u00e9sence de J.-Arthur Paquet, qui a fait au pr\u00e9sident la suggestion d\u2019ajouter cinq points sur son bulletin pour donner effet \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision unanime du jury que Payment, de tous les candidats, \u00e9tait celui qui devait aller en Europe pour r\u00e9aliser le but du chapitre 139 des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui est une loi \u201cpour favoriser le d\u00e9veloppement de Tart musical\u201d. La base d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation propos\u00e9 par l\u2019examinateur L\u00e9o-Pol Morin peut \u00eatre discutable; mais apr\u00e8s discussion elle a ralli\u00e9 les suffrages unanimes du jury charg\u00e9 par la loi d\u2019accorder le plus grand nombre de points \u00e0 l\u2019un des candidats au concours.\nLes dommages soufferts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s non par la proclamation du jury mais par l\u2019action des officiers de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, subs\u00e9quemment au 17 juin 1932. M. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelletier, pr\u00e9sident, M. Orner L\u00e9tourneau, vice-pr\u00e9sident, M. Edouard LeBel, secr\u00e9taire, et M. J.-Arthur Paquet, tr\u00e9sorier, lors de la r\u00e9union \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, mardi 28 juin 1932, n\u2019avaient pas le droit, ni le pouvoir, de d\u00e9cider de faire une v\u00e9rification compl\u00e8te des devoirs des candidats et des points qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s par les juges sous pr\u00e9texte de pouvoir fournir au gouvernement tous les renseignements qu\u2019il pourrait exiger d\u2019eux en leur qualit\u00e9 de fid\u00e9icommis (sic). Il n\u2019y a pas de preuve au dossier que le gouvernement ait demand\u00e9 ces renseignements. Les officiers n\u2019avaient ni juridiction, ni pouvoir, de faire les constatations ins\u00e9r\u00e9es au m\u00e9moire confidentiel P12 au sujet des candidats Pich\u00e9, Pelletier et B\u00e9langer et de faire une nouvelle r\u00e9partition des points entre ces derniers. Enfin, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, ces officiers n\u2019avaient pas le droit de convoquer les membres du jury qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour une fin sp\u00e9ciale, qui avaient rempli leur r\u00f4le au meilleur de leurs connaissances et jugement et dont la d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e et proclam\u00e9e en faveur du demandeur; et surtout l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie ne pouvait exercer la pression qu\u2019elle a \u00e9videmment mise en \u0153uvre lors de la r\u00e9union du 21 juillet pour d\u00e9pouiller Payment du prix d\u2019Europe. L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique a donc d\u00e9pass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs et doit \u00eatre tenue responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 Payment par son fait, que ce soit le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019imprudence, de n\u00e9gligence ou d\u2019inhabilit\u00e9 (Art. 1053 C.C.).\nLe montant accord\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi me para\u00eet raisonnable. Il est bon de remarquer que le plaidoyer des d\u00e9fendeurs, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, Couture et Miro, ne contient aucune all\u00e9gation de fraude ou de favoritisme et que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est all\u00e9 au del\u00e0 de la contestation li\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il semble accuser de favoritisme soit le pr\u00e9sident Bernier, soit le juge L\u00e9o-Pol Morin, quand ce dernier surtout n\u2019avait pas eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00eatre entendu, vu son absence en Europe; et ce malgr\u00e9 la demande des procureurs du demandeur au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\nDe plus, le verdict de chaque membre du jury doit \u00eatre constat\u00e9 sur le bulletin remis et sign\u00e9 par chacun d\u2019eux entre les mains du secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie. Ces documents, une fois de jugement rendu et entr\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s-verbal, ne peuvent \u00eatre chang\u00e9s par une preuve verbale \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre attaqu\u00e9s devant un tribunal comp\u00e9tent par l\u2019un des candidats sur all\u00e9gation de fraude. Mais l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie elle-m\u00eame ne saurait \u00eatre admise, au d\u00e9triment du candidat heureux, \u00e0 prouver le contraire du certificat \u00e9crit d\u00e9livr\u00e9 au demandeur. Apr\u00e8s la proclamation, ce dernier avait le droit de consid\u00e9rer ce certificat comme un droit acquis \u00e0 tous les avantages qui pouvaient en d\u00e9couler en vertu du statut.\nJe renverrais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vall\u00e9e, Vien, Beaudry & Fortier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gu\u00e9rard & Pelland.\n[1] (1935) Q.R. 59 K.B. 121.\n[2] (1935) Q.R. 59 K.B. 121.\n[3] [1914] A.C. 569.\n",

Ce r\u00e8glement, sp\u00e9cialement ratifi\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature, dont la validit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas contestable, assurait cette exemption \u00e0 tous les ayants droit de la compagnie pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans. Bien que la compagnie exempt\u00e9e e\u00fbt cess\u00e9 d\u2019exploiter son industrie depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelante avait toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme jouissant de cette exemption jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que, en 1931, on imposa pour la premi\u00e8re fois sur l\u2019immeuble les taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par l\u2019action. Le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 attaquait aussi la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures et ajoutait que l\u2019\u00e9valuation au montant de $268,283 \u00e9tait vexatoire, injuste, oppressive et d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 radicale.\nCette premi\u00e8re contestation fut li\u00e9e entre les parties en f\u00e9vrier 1933 et la cause resta en suspens jusqu\u2019\u00e0 janvier 1934, alors qu\u2019un plaidoyer puis darrein continuans fut produit all\u00e9guant qu\u2019aux termes d\u2019une r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante le 9 mars 1933 une entente \u00e9tait intervenue entre les parties suivant laquelle en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une somme de $500, dont $250 payable dans les trente jours et la balance le 1er mai 1933, la corporation s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer la pr\u00e9sente action r\u00e9gl\u00e9e hors de cour, chaque partie payant ses frais. Vu le paiement de cette somme de $500 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, l\u2019action aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teinte et devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce plaidoyer suppl\u00e9mentaire, l\u2019appelante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9:\nQu\u2019au commencement du mois de mars 1933, le mis-en-cause Betcherman a rencontr\u00e9 le maire et les conseillers de la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e et leur a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu\u2019une compagnie nouvelle connue sous le nom de Canadian Gold Seal Electrical Corporation Limited se proposait d\u2019occuper une partie des immeubles sur lesquels les taxes municipales \u00e9taient r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente action, ajoutant que ladite compagnie y construirait une industrie qui emploierait un grand nombre de personnes, ce qui serait un grand avantage au progr\u00e8s et d\u00e9veloppement du village de Desch\u00eanes; que ces repr\u00e9sentations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le mis-en-cause Betcherman alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Klein, organisateur ou promoteur de l\u2019industrie susmentionn\u00e9e; que ledit mis-en-cause a alors offert de n\u00e9gocier pour et au nom de la corporation pour amener ladite industrie \u00e0 Desch\u00eanes, \u00e0 condition que le montant des taxes qui \u00e9taient dues par lui sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019il occupait et qui sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente action, seraient r\u00e9duites \u00e0 la somme de $500; que ces offres de service dudit Betcherman ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises au conseil de la corporation-intim\u00e9e, et que c\u2019est alors, le 9 mars 1933, \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e dudit conseil, que la r\u00e9solution ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e.\nEt elle ajoute:\nQue lesdites repr\u00e9sentations n\u2019ont jamais eu de suite et que ladite compagnie Canadian Gold Seal Electrical Corporation Limited n\u2019a jamais, avant le mois de mai ou en aucun temps, fait aucune construction ou install\u00e9 aucune industrie dans le village de Desch\u00eanes; et que n\u2019y aurait-il que ces faits, ladite r\u00e9solution n\u2019aurait aucune force et effet, les conditions n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies;\nQue ladite r\u00e9solution est en outre ill\u00e9gale et nulle, le conseil ayant dans les circonstances exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ses pouvoirs et ne pouvant de par la loi faire remise de taxes sur lesdites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s par une r\u00e9solution et ladite r\u00e9solution \u00e9tant contraire aux dispositions du Code Municipal qui r\u00e9git la corporation demanderesse; Que sur les $500 que devait payer le mis-en-cause Betcherman, $250 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encaiss\u00e9s et appliqu\u00e9s en acompte sur les taxes; mais ajoute qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le ch\u00e8que du mis-en-cause pour le paiement de balance, afin que l\u2019acceptation dudit ch\u00e8que ne soit pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en paiement entier du montant de toutes les taxes dues sur lesdites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s; et elle conclut\nQue ladite r\u00e9solution du conseil du 9 mars 1933 soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, nulle et de nul effet et \u00e0 ce que le plaidoyer puis d\u2019arrein continuance soit renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, a all\u00e9gu\u00e9, entre autres choses, que la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution, base du plaidoyer suppl\u00e9mentaire, a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation devant la Cour du Magistrat de Hull, dans une cause intent\u00e9e par une \u00e9lectrice de la corporation contre elle et le mis-en-cause Betcherman et que, par le jugement rendu par la Cour du Magistrat, la r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e l\u00e9gale et dans les limites des attributions de l\u2019appelante et que partant il y a chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de ladite r\u00e9solution.\nCes deux plaidoyers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a maintenu l\u2019action de l\u2019appelante pour $2,183.83, donnant cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour $500 que ce dernier avait pay\u00e9s pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019entente du 9 mars 1933.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a jug\u00e9 que le premier juge avait \u00e0 tort rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution du 9 mars et a maintenu le plaidoyer puis d\u2019arrein continuance.\nLe diff\u00e9rend entre les deux cours porte sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e9solution du 9 mars et sur sa l\u00e9galit\u00e9. Les \u00e9minents magistrats qui ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la cause se sont \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s sur l\u2019effet qu\u2019il faut donner au jugement de la Cour du Magistrat d\u00e9clarant l\u00e9gale et intra vires la r\u00e9solution du conseil municipal de l\u2019appelante.\nPour bien r\u00e9aliser les circonstances qui ont amen\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 transiger, il est bon de rappeler que, non seulement la municipalit\u00e9, mais aussi la commission scolaire de Desch\u00eanes, \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans le recouvrement des taxes qu\u2019on avait impos\u00e9es sur l\u2019immeuble en question. Or, il appert que la commission scolaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie par Betcherman et autres pour l\u2019annulation des r\u00f4les d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur dans le village de Desch\u00eanes; que cette cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue au m\u00e9rite en janvier 1933 et \u00e9tait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1933 devant l\u2019honorable juge Coderre. Il appert \u00e0 cette m\u00eame r\u00e9solution que Betcherman a offert de consentir \u00e0 ce que cette action soit renvoy\u00e9e sans frais et a aussi offert d\u2019user de son influence pour obtenir l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans le village de Desch\u00eanes et le fonctionnement, avant le 1er juillet 1933, d\u2019une manufacture de la Canadian Seal Electrical Corporation Limited. Il a, de plus, offert de payer la somme de $3,000 en r\u00e8glement de toutes taxes scolaires et autres dues et qui pourraient \u00eatre dues par lui et ses auteurs et ses successeurs jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale 1932-1933. La commission scolaire consid\u00e9ra avantageux d\u2019accepter ces propositons, en vue de la crise qui existait et du besoin urgent de la commission scolaire pour le maintien de ses \u00e9coles et des difficult\u00e9s que la commisson scolaire pourrait avoir \u00e0 percevoir les taxes qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clamait dudit Betcherman.\nQuelques jours apr\u00e8s, le 9 mars 1933, la municipalit\u00e9, \u00e0 son tour, passa la r\u00e9solution suivante, qui fut accept\u00e9e par Betcherman comme garant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Loveys, envers qui il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu responsable du paiement des arr\u00e9rages de taxes:\nWhereas William Betcherman and others are owners of land and buildings in the village of Desch\u00eanes, viz: Part of lot 15A in the first range of the township of Hull, and have been assessed by this corporation, and suit has been entered into by the said council to recover the sum of $2,683 for taxes which suit is pending to be heard at the present moment;\nWhereas the said William Betcherman and others are at present negotiating an agreement with the Canadian Gold Seal Electrical Corporation Limited for locating this important industry in Desch\u00eanes thereby rendering a considerable service to the population of the village of Desch\u00eanes, and the said Wm. Betcherman and others have offered to settle with the council all existing difficulties with regard to above taxes by paying to the said council the sum of five hundred dollars in full settlement of all taxes up to and including 1932-1933;\nIt is in consequence resolved that in consideration of the sum of five hundred dollars payable $250 within thirty days and the balance before the first of May, 1933, to the said council by Mr. Wm. Betcherman and others, and paying all their own costs, the council will cause to have above action declared settled out of court and pay their costs, the council will assess the Canadian Gold Seal Electrical Corporation Limited for the year 1933-34 as mutually agreed upon between the company and the council and will assess Wm. Betcherman and others for the balance of their property; Mr. Wm. Betcherman to employ for construction work, people from Desch\u00eanes, preferably and if possible.\nLe procureur de la municipalit\u00e9, par une lettre du 15 avril 1933, disait:\nThe secretary-treasurer has given me a copy of the resolution adopted by the council on the ninth of March last.\nI give to the resolution the interpretation that upon payment of the sum of $500 the case actually pending before the court, shall be declared settled out of court and that the council is paying its own costs We do not intend to proceed with the case during the next term but as soon as we are informed that the payment has been made, we are ready to put before the court, a document with a certified copy of the resolution of the council that the case has been settled out of court. Judgment may be entered then according to the resolution of the council which has been accepted by Mr. Betcherman.\nLe 3 mai 1933, un M. Klein, repr\u00e9sentant de la firme qui devait s\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 Desch\u00eanes, comparut devant le conseil de l\u2019appelante et obtint, pour commencer ses travaux, une extension de d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019au 17 mai. Dans l\u2019intervalle, Betcherman avait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante un premier ch\u00e8que de $250 qui fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque et pay\u00e9 le 21 avril.\nLe 17 juillet, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier \u00e9crivit au mis-en-cause Betcherman au sujet de la r\u00e9ception par l\u2019appelante du second versement de $250, disant que le conseil ne pouvait l\u2019accepter parce qu\u2019une action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre la municipalit\u00e9, demandant l\u2019annulation de la r\u00e9solution qui acceptait ces cinq cents dollars en r\u00e8glement des taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente action.\nOn remarquera que, par cette lettre, la municipalit\u00e9 ne mentionne aucune condition affectant la r\u00e9solution et ne se plaint pas \u00e0 Betcherman du retard de la Gold Seal Corporation \u00e0 commencer les travaux propos\u00e9s. Ce second versement fut encaiss\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante qui en donne cr\u00e9dit aux d\u00e9fendeur et mis-en-cause.\nL\u2019action mentionn\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante dans cette lettre fut jug\u00e9e par la Cour du Magistrat. L\u2019appelante s\u2019en \u00e9tant rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 justice, c\u2019est le mis-en-cause Betcherman qui contesta cette action. Voici les principaux consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement qui int\u00e9ressent la pr\u00e9sente cause:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le 11 avril 1932, la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse dans cette cause a institu\u00e9 devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de ce district, une action portant le n\u00b0 3933 contre un nomm\u00e9 George Loveys, d\u00e9fendeur, et Wm. Betcherman et al., mis-en-cause;\nConsid\u00e9rant que Wm. Betcherman mentionn\u00e9 comme mis-en-cause \u00e0 l\u2019action cit\u00e9e plus haut est le m\u00eame Wm. Betcherman, mis-en-cause dans la pr\u00e9sente instance;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ladite cause n\u00b0 3933 ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment inscrite pour preuve et audition le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1933;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019en date du 9 mars 1933 la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse a adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution en vertu de laquelle elle acceptait la somme de $500 en r\u00e8glement d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation de $2,683 qu\u2019elle avait contre ledit Geo. Lovey et Wm. Betcherman, mis-en-cause et autres personnes pour taxes municipales, et r\u00e9glait par le fait m\u00eame sadite action n\u00b0 3933 pendante devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure comme susdit;\nConsid\u00e9rant que par son action, la demanderesse en cette cause, demande la nullit\u00e9 de ladite r\u00e9solution de la d\u00e9fenderesse, en date du 9 mars 1933, comme \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gale et nulle, parce que cette r\u00e9solution aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des articles 684 et 687 du Code Municipal, et du chapitre 116 des S.R.Q. 1925 qui, entre autre chose, d\u00e9fend \u00e0 toute municipalit\u00e9 de venir en aide soit directement ou indirectement \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement industriel ou commercial en lui accordant une exemption de taxes;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas dans la pr\u00e9sente instance d\u2019une remise d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur des arr\u00e9rages de taxes ou d\u2019une exemption de taxes \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement commercial ou industriel, mais bien plut\u00f4t d\u2019une transaction entre la corporation-d\u00e9fenderesse et le mis-en-cause, par laquelle on r\u00e9glait le proc\u00e8s existant entre eux, la corporation-d\u00e9fenderesse d\u00e9cidant \u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison qu\u2019il valait mieux r\u00e9gler que de plaider ledit proc\u00e8s;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce r\u00e8glement semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019aboutissement et la conclusion de pourparlers entre lesdites parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, et para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de bonne foi de part et d\u2019autre; la corporation-d\u00e9fenderesse croyant pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019accepter $500 en r\u00e8glement de sa r\u00e9clamation pour un montant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que de courir le risque d\u2019un proc\u00e8s qu\u2019elle pouvait perdre sans compter les frais qu\u2019elle aurait eus \u00e0 payer en plus advenant ce r\u00e9sultat.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019une corporation municipale a le pouvoir de transiger plut\u00f4t que de continuer un proc\u00e8s qu\u2019elle pourrait perdre, et que hors le cas de fraude, il n\u2019appartient pas aux tribunaux de reviser les d\u00e9cisions adopt\u00e9es par les conseils municipaux dans l\u2019exercice de leum pouvoirs administratifs, m\u00eame si des d\u00e9cisions sont apparemment inopportunes et d\u00e9savantageuses pour la corporation: Gravel v. La corporation de la paroisse de Dolbeau, mise-en-cause[1].\n* * *\nConsid\u00e9rant que la demanderesse n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s essentiels de sa d\u00e9claration, et que le mis-en-cause a \u00e9tabli la partie essentielle de sa d\u00e9fense;\nLa Cour, pour les raisons contenues dans la premi\u00e8re partie de ce jugement, rejette l\u2019action de la demanderesse avec d\u00e9pens.\nLes procureurs de l\u2019appelante ne donnent aucune raison \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la pr\u00e9tention que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, non plus que la Cour du Banc du Roi, ne peuvent consid\u00e9rer comme d\u00e9cisif un jugement de la Cour de Magistrat ayant acquis entre les parties force de chose jug\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure en r\u00e9sultant doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi, m\u00eame si elle r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un jugement rendu par une cour inf\u00e9rieure, mais comp\u00e9tente. Je suis d\u2019avis que ce moyen invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante est mal fond\u00e9 en droit.\nLa contestation li\u00e9e entre les parties est-elle suffisamment s\u00e9rieuse pour pouvoir servir de base \u00e0 une transaction valide?\nDans Gravel & al v. La Corporation de la Paroisse de Dolbeau1, la Cour du Banc du Roi a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une corporation municipale a le pouvoir de transiger plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019engager dans un proc\u00e8s et que, hors le cas de fraude, il n\u2019appartient pas aux tribunaux de reviser les d\u00e9cisions adopt\u00e9es par les conseils municipaux dans l\u2019exercice de leurs pouvoirs administratifs, m\u00eame si ces d\u00e9cisions sont inopportunes et d\u00e9savantageuses pour la corporation.\nLe tribunal \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 du juge-en-chef LaFontaine et des honorables juges Dorion, Tellier, Bernier et Gali-peault.\nL\u2019honorable juge Tellier disait:\nL\u2019arrangement pouvait n\u2019\u00eatre pas avantageux; il est assez probable qu\u2019il ne T\u00e9tait pas; mais il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de bonne foi; et le conseil avait le pouvoir de le faire.\nC\u2019est v\u00e9ritablement une transaction que l\u2019on a faite. * * * De part et d\u2019autre, on redoutait le proc\u00e8s; et, pour le pr\u00e9venir, on a fait des concessions r\u00e9ciproques. * * * A tort ou \u00e0 raison, le conseil a cru qu\u2019il valait mieu r\u00e9gler que plaider. C\u2019\u00e9tait son affaire. Du moment qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs, qu\u2019aucune fraude n\u2019est \u00e9tablie, et qu\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u00e9galement, la Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e0 intervenir; elle n\u2019en a pas le droit.\nC\u2019est sur ce jugement que monsieur le magistrat de district a bas\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision; et une \u00e9tude attentive m\u2019a convaincu que, dans les circonstances d\u00e9voil\u00e9es au dossier, l\u2019acte des corporations scolaire et municipale, en transigeant avec Betcherman pour obtenir imm\u00e9diatement le paiement de trois mille dollars ($3,000) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un acte de mauvaise administration et ne constituait pas, non plus, une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la prohibition de venir en aide \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement industriel ou commercial en lui accordant une exemption de taxes. C\u2019\u00e9tait, de la part du conseil municipal, une premi\u00e8re tentative de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la loi sp\u00e9ciale qui avait accord\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement au terrain en question une exemption de taxes pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans, \u00e0 la condition que l\u2019on y construirait une usine et que cette usine emploierait un certain nombre d\u2019ouvriers \u201cwhen in operation,\u201d \u201cas the requirements of the British American Nickel Corporation, Limited, may require.\u201d Bien que les portes de cette usine eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9es depuis 1920, l\u2019on avait tout de m\u00eame interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la loi en faveur des d\u00e9tenteurs du site et la taxe n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 1931 que l\u2019on d\u00e9cida de s\u2019attaquer aux d\u00e9fendeurs et aux mis-en-cause. On \u00e9valua cette usine abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 au del\u00e0 d\u2019un quart de million et l\u2019on imposa les taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente action. Le plaidoyer faisant valoir l\u2019exemption, l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la confection du r\u00f4le et l\u2019exag\u00e9ration presque frauduleuse de l\u2019\u00e9valuation municipale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, futile, ni de mauvaise foi. Les n\u00e9gociations entre les parties prouvent que l\u2019on \u00e9tait, de part et d\u2019autre, de bonne foi et que l\u2019on croyait sinc\u00e8rement, dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat de la municipalit\u00e9 appelante et de ses contribuables, devoir mettre fin au proc\u00e8s. Betcherman offrit $3,000 en r\u00e8glement des taxes sur ce terrain pour les ann\u00e9es 1931, 1932 et 1933; et, suivant l\u2019entente intervenue entre les commissaires d\u2019\u00e9coles et les conseillers municipaux, dont plusieurs membres si\u00e9geaient dans les deux bureaux, l\u2019on accorda $2,500 aux \u00e9coles et $500 \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s avoir accept\u00e9 cet argent, l\u2019appelante a refus\u00e9 de remplir la promesse faite par la r\u00e9solution, suivant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de son propre procureur, et a contest\u00e9 le plaidoyer puis darrein continuans en voulant ajouter \u00e0 cette r\u00e9solution une condition qui ne s\u2019y trouve pas, savoir: que si la nouvelle usine n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tablie avant le 1er mai 1933, la transaction serait nulle et de nul effet. La preuve verbale que l\u2019on a tent\u00e9 de faire \u00e0 ce sujet et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par le premier juge, m\u00eame si elle pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u00e9gale, ne serait pas suffisante. Il est prouv\u00e9 clairement par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fournier, Conseil du Roi et d\u00e9put\u00e9 du comt\u00e9, que cette condition, qui avait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par Betcherman, sur son avis.\nNous restons donc purement et simplement avec cette partie de la r\u00e9solution qui dit que, sur paiement de $500, la pr\u00e9sente action devra \u00eatre retir\u00e9e, chaque partie payant ses frais. Nous n\u2019avons pas, pour le moment, \u00e0 approuver la commutation de taxes pour 1932 et 1933, ni ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9valuation future du terrain suivant entente \u00e0 intervenir entre l\u2019appelante et la Gold Seal Electrical Corporation. Nous n\u2019avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer cette r\u00e9solution qu\u2019en autant qu\u2019elle prouve la transaction all\u00e9gu\u00e9e comme mettant fin \u00e0 la poursuite. Elle a certainement cette port\u00e9e et \u00e0 la seule condition du paiement des $500.\nReste la question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution et de la transaction qu\u2019elle autorise. Devons-nous appliquer, en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, qu\u2019il invoque? L\u2019article 1241. L\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e (res judicata) est une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure; elle n\u2019a lieu qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qui fait l\u2019objet du jugement, et lorsque la demande est fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame cause, est entre les m\u00eames parties agissant dans les m\u00eames qualit\u00e9s et pour la m\u00eame chose que dans l\u2019instance jug\u00e9e.\nLe premier juge a refus\u00e9 de se consid\u00e9rer li\u00e9 par le jugement de la Cour de Magistrat qui d\u2019ailleurs, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, ne constituait pas chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties; et l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef Tellier a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur dans la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e9tait un tiers qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie dans la cause jug\u00e9e par la Cour de Magistrat. Le savant juge-en-chef dit:\nIl est vrai que l\u2019action en cassation qui fut intent\u00e9e devant ladite Cour de Magistrat en vertu de l\u2019article 430 du Code municipal, \u00e9tait une action publique, mis \u00e0 la disposition de tout \u00e9lecteur municipal et de tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9; mais l\u2019exercice de cette action, par un \u00e9lecteur ou un int\u00e9ress\u00e9, ne pouvait affecter en rien, soit favorablement, soit d\u00e9favorablement, au moins en cas d\u2019insucc\u00e8s, les droits, obligations ou recours de droit commun de la corporation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers, ou de ces derniers envers elle.\nOn ajoute que le jugement rendu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas entre les m\u00eames parties. Or, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans une cause de Stevenson v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[2],\nLes corporations municipales repr\u00e9sentent en justice leurs contribuables et un jugement rendu en faveur d\u2019une telle corporation ou contre elle, peut, lorsqu\u2019il y a identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet et de cause, \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 tout autre contribuable.\nNotons, en passant, que ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par cette Cour[3]. L\u2019article 4 du Code municipal dit:\nLes habitants et les contribuables de chaque municipalit\u00e9 * * * de village forment une corporation ou corps politique.\nconnu, dans notre cas, sous le nom de \u201cLa Corporation du Village de Desch\u00eanes\u201d; et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 5, \u201ctoute corporation peut transiger dans les limites de ses attributions\u201d. Loveys et tous les autres habitants et contribuables \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le magistrat par la corporation appelante dont ils forment partie comme tels.\nVoir \u00e0 ce sujet les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par feu le juge Blan-chet dans Stevenson v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[4],\nBetcherman, mis en cause devant le magistrat, est le m\u00eame William Betcherman qui est pr\u00e9sentement mis en cause par l\u2019appelante. Loveys, le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9, ne fut pas nomm\u00e9ment partie au proc\u00e8s institu\u00e9 devant la Cour de Magistrat: il y \u00e9tait comme contribuable de l\u2019appelante qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9fenderesse.\nDe plus, et d\u2019abondant, il \u00e9tait suffisamment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Betcherman pour pouvoir invoquer le jugement rendu en faveur de ce dernier. Quelles \u00e9taient les relations juridiques entre eux?\nEn octobre 1931, lors de l\u2019imposition des taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, Loveys apparaissait au bureau d\u2019enregistrement comme le propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble affect\u00e9 au paiement de ces taxes. Il faut cependant admettre que, d\u00e8s d\u00e9cembre 1930, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait vendu cet immeuble \u00e0 M. Gordon Adams, avec obligation pour l\u2019acheteur de payer les taxes qui seraient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avenir sur l\u2019immeuble. Quelques jours apr\u00e8s, Adams avait transport\u00e9 tous ses droits dans cet immeuble \u00e0 Betcheman qui, naturellement, assuma toutes les obligations de son vendeur envers Loveys. Il r\u00e9sulte de ce fait que Betcherman, lors de l\u2019institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, \u00e9tait le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9biteur des taxes en question, que Loveys poursuivi aurait pu appeler en garantie son acqu\u00e9reur Adams qui, \u00e0 son tour, aurait pu appeler en sous-garantie William Betcherman. Ce dernier, d\u2019ailleurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause par la corporation appelante et les conclusions de d\u00e9laissement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises contre lui \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble affect\u00e9 par les taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es; et c\u2019est pourquoi Betcherman, d\u00e9tenteur de l\u2019immeuble et garant des taxes vis-\u00e0-vis du d\u00e9fendeur Loveys, a conclu directement avec l\u2019appelante l\u2019arrangement qui a fait l\u2019objet du litige devant la Cour de Magistrat et qui fait encore l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente contestation.\nIl faut partager l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi que William Betcherman, lorsqu\u2019il a transig\u00e9 avec la corporation, agissait tant en son nom personnel qu\u2019au nom de ses auteurs et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9charge: et de m\u00eame que, lors du proc\u00e8s devant la Cour de Magistrat o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait mis en cause, il a contest\u00e9 l\u2019action de la demanderesse Ayotte qui concluait \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution tant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour ses auteurs dont il \u00e9tait le garant. Or, je crois que la doctrine et la jurisprudence sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le garanti, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Loveys, a droit d\u2019invoquer le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en faveur de son garant, Nous avons donc identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet, identit\u00e9 de cause et identit\u00e9 de parties, relativement \u00e0 l\u2019un des deux moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante pour l\u2019annulation de la r\u00e9solution du 9 mars, savoir: le d\u00e9faut de capacit\u00e9 de la corporation intim\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce m\u00eame moyen d\u2019exc\u00e8s de pouvoir qui a servi de base au jugement de premi\u00e8re instance; et nous croyons que, sur ce point, la Cour du Banc du Roi a eu raison d\u2019appliquer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nCette autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s\u2019applique pas cependant \u00e0 l\u2019autre moyen invoqu\u00e9 par le premier juge, savoir: que le r\u00e8glement intervenu entre les parties \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de la nouvelle compagnie d\u00e8s le 1er mai.\nM\u00eame si cette condition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, il faut, je crois, en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la preuve orale et les circonstances qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et suivi l\u2019adoption de cette r\u00e9solution par Betcherman d\u00e9montrent que le r\u00e8glement n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 du succ\u00e8s ou de l\u2019insucc\u00e8s des efforts de Betcherman pour persuader Klein et la Canadian Gold Seal Electrical Corporation de s\u2019\u00e9tablir sur son terrain et introduire une nouvelle industrie dans Desch\u00eanes. D\u2019ailleurs, malgr\u00e9 les efforts de l\u2019appelante, Betcherman a carr\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 de garantir l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cette industrie comme condition du compromis, et la r\u00e9solution, amput\u00e9e de cette clause, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e. L\u2019article 1234 C.C. s\u2019applique et la preuve testimoniale doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e si elle tend \u00e0 contredire la r\u00e9solution ou \u00e0 en changer les termes.\nJe renverrais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ste-Marie & Ste-Marie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Redmond Quain.\n[1] (1931) Q.R. 51 K.B. 491.\n1 (1931) Q.R. 51 K.B. 491.\n[2] (1896) Q.R. 6 Q.B. 107.\n[3] (1897) 27 Can.

Act (Criminal law). Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting as to subsection (a).\nPer Cannon and Crocket JJ.\u2014Subsection (a) deals directly with matters of civil rights and describes an act which lacks every element of what is ordinarily associated with criminal law. Its incorporation in the Criminal Code is a mere colourable attempt on the part of the Parliament of Canada to encroach upon the legislative authority of the provinces.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers conferred by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), of the following question: Is section 498A of the Criminal Code, or any or what part or parts of the said section ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the question to the Court is as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 30th October, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to an Act to amend the Criminal Code, being chapter 56 of the Statutes of Canada, 1935, and in particular to section 9 of the said Act, whereby the Criminal Code was amended by inserting therein after section 498 the following section:\n\u201c498A. Every person engaged in trade or commerce or industry is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or to one month\u2019s imprisonment, or, if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars, who\n(a) is a party or privy to, or assists in, any transaction or sale which discriminates, to his knowledge, against competitors of the purchaser in that any discount, rebate or allowance is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate or allowance available at the time of such transaction to the aforesaid competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like quality and quantity; The provisions of this paragraph shall not, however, prevent a co-operative society returning to producers or consumers, or a co-operative wholesale society returning to its constituent retail members, the whole or any part of the net surplus made in its trading operations in proportion to purchases made from or sales to the society; (b) engages in a policy of selling goods in any area of Canada at prices lower than those exacted by such seller elsewhere in Canada, for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor in such part of Canada;\n(c) engages in a policy of selling goods at prices unreasonably low for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.\u201d The Minister observes that said section 498A was enacted for the purpose of giving effect to certain recommendations contained in the Report of the Royal Commission on Price Spreads but that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had legislative jurisdiction to enact this section, in whole or in part, and that it is expedient that such question should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following question be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act:\nIs said section 498A of the Criminal Code, or any or what part or parts of the said section, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council. *N. W. Rowell K.C., Louis St-Laurent K.C. and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nA. W. Roebuck K.C. (Attorney-General) and I. A.

Quigg for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014Section 498A, the validity of which is in question, is in these terms:\n498A. (1) Every person engaged in trade or commerce or industry is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or to one month\u2019s imprisonment or, if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars, who\n(a) is a party or privy to, or assists in, any transaction of sale which discriminates, to his knowledge, against competitors of the purchaser in that any discount, rebate or allowance is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate or allowance available at the time of such transaction to the aforesaid competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like quality and quantity;\nThe provisions of this paragraph shall not, however, prevent a cooperative society returning to producers or consumers, or a co-operative wholesale society returning to its constituent retail members, the whole or any part of the net surplus made in its trading operations in proportion to purchases made from or sales to the society;\n(b) engages in a policy of selling goods in any area of Canada at prices lower than those exacted by such seller elsewhere in Canada, for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor in such part of Canada;\n(c) engages in a policy of selling goods at prices unreasonably low for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.\nThis section in substance declares that everybody is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to punishment in respect thereof who does any of the acts or series of acts denoted by subsections (a), (b) and (c). We see no good reason for denying the authority of Parliament, under subdivision 27 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, to pass these enactments.\nReporter\u2019s note: Same counsel also appeared at the argument of all the other References reported. Prima facie, they are enactments in relation to matters comprehended within the subject designated by the words of the 27th head of section 91, under any definition of \u201cthe criminal law.\u201d The prohibitions seem to be aimed at the prevention of practices which Parliament conceives to be inimical to the public welfare; and each of the offences is declared in explicit terms to be an indictable offence.\nThere is nothing in the circumstances or the operation of these provisions to show that Parliament was not exercising its powers under that subdivision. Whatever doubt may have previously existed, none can remain since the decision of the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada[1], that, in enacting laws in relation to matters falling within the subject of the criminal law, as these words are used in section 91, Parliament is not restricted by any rule limiting the acts declared to be criminal acts to such as would appear to a court of law to be \u201cin their own nature\u201d criminal. The jurisdiction in relation to the criminal law is plenary; and enactments passed within the scope of that jurisdiction are not subject to review by the courts.\nIt is true that the term \u201ccriminal law\u201d in section 91, subdivision 27, must be read subject to some qualification upon the ordinary sense of the words. When it is said that \u201ccriminal law\u201d in section 91 (27) is criminal law in its widest sense, it is not meant that by force of section 92, including subdivision 15 of that section, the provinces have no power to pass enactments which would fall within the scope of the \u201ccriminal law,\u201d as that phrase would ordinarily be understood as applied to the enactments of a legislature possessing a general competence in relation to the criminal law. People in Canada are familiar with a network of prohibitions and regulations, the violation of which is punishable by fine, and sometimes by imprisonment, under municipal bylaws passed under the authority of provincial legislative measures. It has been held in many cases that prohibitions enforceable by fine and imprisonment enacted by the provincial legislatures may be valid enactments under section 92. Notable instances are the prohibitions enacted under the local option law of Ontario which was in question in A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Dominion[2]; and the conditional and qualified prohibitions enforceable in the same way which were upheld in Hodge v. The Queen[3]. Then there are the groups of provincial statutes passed under the authority of section 92 (1) dealing with the disqualification of voters; the disqualification of persons elected to sit and vote as members of the provincial legislatures; in which offences are created punishable by fine and imprisonment. These enactments which, in part at least, have the purpose of securing public order, and protecting the integrity of the representative system in the provinces, would, as I have said, fall within almost any definition of criminal law.\nBy the introductory clause of section 91, it is declared:\n* * * that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated;\nwhich classes of subjects include the \u201ccriminal law\u201d; and the final paragraph of that section declares, in effect, that \u201cany matter coming within\u201d the criminal law shall not be deemed to come within any matter of a local or private nature\ncomprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nClearly, if the term \u201ccriminal law\u201d is used in an absolutely unrestricted sense (in subdivision 27), then nothing in the nature of criminal law could be enacted under the authority of section 92. As Lord Herschell observed in the course of the argument on the reference already mentioned, in 1896, respecting the Ontario Local Option Statute, the term \u201ccriminal law\u201d in subdivision 27 must be construed in such a way as to leave room for the operation of enactments of a provincial legislature under section 92 of the character just adverted to. It is also well settled that the Parliament of Canada cannot acquire jurisdiction over a subject which belongs exclusively to the provinces by attaching penal sanctions to legislation which in its pith and substance is legislation in relation to that subject in its provincial aspects alone (In re Insurance Act of Canada)[4]. We do not think any of these considerations are properly applicable to the statute before us. We think there is no ground on which we can hold that the statute, on its true construction, is not what it professes to be: an enactment creating criminal offences in exercise of the powers vested in Parliament in virtue of the 27th head of section 91.\nThe statute being intra vires, the interrogatory addressed to us should be answered in the negative.\nCannon J.\u2014Paragraph (a) of 498A injects into every contract of sale by a person engaged in trade, commerce or industry a stipulation, obligatory under pain of a fine or imprisonment, in favour of the competitors of the purchaser, that any discount, rebate or allowance granted to the purchaser would be available at the time of the transaction to the aforesaid competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like quality and quantity.\nThis would, in every such case, be an application, by force of law, to every competitor of the purchaser as against the vendor of the \u201cstipulation pour autrui\u201d provided for by article 1029 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, which says:\n\u201cA party in like manner may stipulate for the benefit of a third person, when such is the condition of a contract which he makes for himself, or of a gift which he makes for another; and he who makes the stipulation cannot revoke it, if the third person have signified his assent to it.\u201d\nPrima facie, therefore, Parliament has legislated directly in a matter of civil rights and has simply annexed to it a sanction, which would, by force of 91 (27) transfer the subject-matter from the provincial to the federal realm.\nBlackstone, in his Commentaries, divides the wrongs known to the law into two species, private and public wrongs, considering torts under the former and crimes under the latter denomination. He says:\nThe distinction seems principally to consist in this: that private wrongs or civil injuries are an infringement or privation of the civil rights which belong to individuals considered merely as individuals; public wrongs or crimes are a breach and violation of the public rights and duties due to the whole community, considered as a community in its social aggregate capacity. As if I detain a field from another man, to which the law has given him a right, this is a civil injury and not a crime; for here only the right of an individual is concerned, and it is immaterial to the public which of us is in possession of the land; but treason, murder and robbery are properly ranked among crimes; since, beyond the injury done to individuals, they strike at the very being of the society; which cannot possibly subsist, where actions of this sort are suffered to escape with impunity.\nThe first characteristic of a crime, therefore, is the danger to the community as a whole which the conduct of the offender is felt to involve. It may, from this point of view, be said to be the breach of a general obligation imposed by the law for the benefit of the State; whereas a tort is the breach of a particular obligation imposed by the law for the benefit of the individual.\nThe second characteristic by which a crime may be recognized is to be found, not in the nature of the conduct itself, but in the consequences to which that conduct gives rise. Whereas the object of the law in the case of a tort is primarily the compensation of the party injured, its object in the case of crime is primarily the punishment of the offender. The civil law looks rather to the plaintiff, the criminal law to the defendant. If, then, the result of the proceedings is the satisfaction of the plaintiff, we may expect to find that the conduct in question amounts to a tort; if it is the punishment of the defendant, then it will be a crime. The result of this difference in attitude is reflected in the royal power of Pardon. The King may pardon a criminal, but not a civil offence. It is reasonable that he should have the power to waive an injury to the State of which he is the representative, and to put an end to proceedings which are carried on in his name; but he cannot absolve a defendant in a civil action from the duty of making compensation to the individual whom he has injured.\nThe above is taken from Stephen\u2019s Commentaries of the Laws of England, 19th ed., vol. IV, pp. 3, 4 and 5, where he gives as an approximate definition of crime that it is the breach of an obligation imposed by law for the benefit of the community and which results in the punishment of the offender.\nEvery command involves a sanction; and thus every law forbids every act which it forbids at all under pain of punishment. This makes it necessary to give a definition of punishment as distinguished from sanction.\nThe sanctions of all laws of every kind will be found to fall under two great heads; those who disobey them may be forced to indemnify another person either by damages or by specific performance, or they may themselves be subjected to some sufferings. In each case the legislator enforces his commands by sanctions, but in the first case the sanction is imposed entirely for the sake of the injured party. Its enforcement is in his discretion and for his advantage. In the second, the sanction consists in suffering imposed on the person disobeying. It must be imposed for public purposes, and have no direct reference to the interests of the person injured by the act punished. Punishments are thus sanctions, but they are sanctions imposed for the public, and at the discretion and by the direction of those who represent the public. The result of the cases appears to be that the infliction of punishment in the interest of the public is the true test by which criminal are distinguished from civil proceedings, and that the moral nature of the act has nothing to do with the question. It is sufficient in this place to observe that they illustrate the general proposition that the province of criminal law must not be supposed to be restricted to those acts which popular language would describe as crimes, but it extends to every act, no matter what its moral quality may be, which the law has forbidden, and to which it has affixed a punishment in the interest of the public.\nI conclude that the first paragraph (a) does not fill the foregoing requirements, inasmuch as it has in view only the protection of the individual competitors of the vendor, not the maintenance of public order or the promotion of the public weal. It deals exclusively with the civil law, and the only logical sanction to enforce the stipulation in favour of an aggrieved competitor would be to give him against the discriminating vendor a recourse in damages for compensation of any damage resulting from a refusal to sell to him at the same price goods of like quality and quantity. The penalty imposed amounts only to a colourable attempt to invade the provincial field.\nSections (b) and (c), on the other hand, are genuine criminal legislation, according to the above criteria.\nI, therefore, say that subsection (a) of section 498A, with the penalties attached, does not come within the definition of criminal law and is ultra vires; subsections (b) and (c) would be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Crocket, J.\u2014It must, I think, be taken as established by the decisions of this Court and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the Parliament of Canada cannot arrogate to itself any legislative jurisdiction, which it would otherwise not possess, in relation to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, by merely dealing with any such subject as criminal law under head 27 of s. 91; and that if, when examined, any legislation, though inserted in the Criminal Code, is found to deal with matters exclusively committed to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces by s. 92, and not to be criminal in its essence, such legislation ought to be declared to be invalid. This principle was clearly affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in its judgment in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[5], delivered by the present Chief Justice of this Court. In that case the Judicial Committee was considering an amendment to s. 508 of the Criminal Code, adding thereto a provision which declared it to be an indictable offence for any person to solicit or accept any insurance risk except on behalf of a company or association licensed under the Dominion Insurance Act, 1917. The Board held that the amendment was invalid, since, in substance though not in form, it was in regulation of contracts of insurance, subjects not within the legislative competence of the Dominion. The Right Honourable Mr. Justice Duff (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of the Board, after reviewing the relevant previous decisions of the Judicial Committee, including the Board of Commerce case[6], and quoting extensively from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Hammer v. Dagenhat[7], said at pp. 339 and 340:\nIt is not seriously disputed that the purpose and effect of the amendment in question are to give compulsory force to the regulative measures of the Insurance Act, and their Lordships think it not open to controversy that in purpose and effect s. 508C is a measure regulating the exercise of civil rights. But, on behalf of the Dominion, it is argued that, although such be the true character of the legislation, the jurisdiction of Parliament, in relation to the criminal law, is unlimited, in the sense, that in execution of its powers over that subject-matter, the Dominion has authority to declare any act a crime, either in itself or by reference to the manner or the conditions in which the act is done, and consequently that s. 508C, being by its terms limited to the creation of criminal offences, falls within the jurisdiction of the Dominion.\nThe power which this argument attributes to the Dominion is, of course, a far-reaching one. Indeed the claim now advanced is nothing less than this, that the Parliament of Canada can assume exclusive control over the exercise of any class of civil rights within the provinces, in respect of which exclusive jurisdiction is given to the provinces under s. 92, by the device of declaring those persons to be guilty of a criminal offence who in the exercise of such rights do not observe the conditions imposed by the Dominion.\nAnd later, at pp. 342 and 343 His Lordship added:\nAnd indeed, to hold otherwise would be incompatible with an essential principle of the Confederation scheme, the object of which, as Lord Watson said in Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[8], was \u201cnot to weld the Provinces into one or to subordinate the Provincial Governments to a central authority,\u201d \u201cWithin the spheres allotted to them by the Act the Dominion and the Provinces are,\u201d as Lord Haldane said in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[9], \u201crendered in general principle co-ordinate Governments.\u201d\nTheir Lordships think it undesirable to attempt to define, however generally, the limits of Dominion jurisdiction under head 27 of s. 91; but they think it proper to observe, that what has been said above does not involve any denial of the authority of the Dominion Parliament to create offences merely because the legislation deals with matters which, in another aspect, may fall under one or more of the subdivisions of the jurisdiction entrusted to the Provinces. It is one thing, for example, to declare corruption in municipal elections, or negligence of a given order in the management of railway trains, to be a criminal offence and punishable under the Criminal Code; it is another thing to make use of the machinery of the criminal law for the purpose of assuming control of municipal corporations or of Provincial railways.\nIn the Board of Commerce case[10] in 1921 the Judicial Committee considered the question of the validity of an order made by the Board of Commerce, under the Board of Commerce Act and the Combines and Fair Prices Act, enacted by the Dominion Parliament in 1919, restraining certain manufacturers of clothing in the city of Ottawa in respect of sale prices of their products. Parliament purported to authorize the Board of Commerce to restrain and prohibit the formation and operation of such trade combinations for production and distribution in the provinces as the Board might consider to be detrimental to the public interest and to give the Board authority also to restrict accumulation of food, clothing and fuel beyond the amount reasonably required in the case of a private person for his household and in the case of a trader for his business, and to require the surplus to be offered for sale at fair prices. The Board was also authorized to attach criminal consequences to any breach of the Act which it determined to be improper. The Judicial Committee held that both these Acts were ultra vires the Dominion Parliament, since they interfered seriously with property and civil rights in the provinces, a subject reserved exclusively to the provincial legislatures by s. 92, and were not passed in any highly exceptional circumstances, such as war or famine, which conceivably might render trade combinations and hoarding outside the heads of s. 92 and within the general power given by s. 91. Counsel for the Dominion in that case argued that the legislation fell under s. 91 (2): The regulation of Trade and Commerce, and also that it fell within s. 91 (27): The Criminal Law, etc Both these contentions were rejected for the reasons stated. Dealing with the criminal law contention, Lord Haldane, in delivering the judgment of the Board said\u2014\nFor analogous reasons the words of head 27 of s. 91 do not assist the argument for the Dominion. It is one thing to construe the words \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters,\u201d as enabling the Dominion Parliament to exercise exclusive legislative power where the subject-matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence. A general law, to take an example, making incest a crime, belongs to this class. It is quite another thing, first to attempt to interfere with a class of subject committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and then to justify this by enacting ancillary provisions, designated as new phases of Dominion criminal law which require a title to so interfere as basis of their application.\nThe learned counsel for the Dominion in the present case strongly argued that the authority of both the Board of Commerce[11] and the Reciprocal Insurers[12] cases had been materially modified by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada[13]. I can find nothing in the judgment in the last-named case, as delivered by Lord Atkin, which detracts in any manner from the authority of either the Board of Commerce11 or the Reciprocal Insurers[14] cases, as regards the interpretation of 91 (27).\nThe Board in the later case was dealing with the validity of this very section of the Criminal Code, as it stood in Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, ch. 36, which made it an indictable offence, punishable by fine or imprisonment, to conspire, combine or agree unduly to limit transportation facilities, restrain commerce or lessen manufacture or competition, as well as with s. 36, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, ch. 26 (The Combines Investigation Act), which made it an indictable offence punishable by fine or imprisonment to be a party to the formation or operation of a combine, as defined by s. 2, viz: a combine \u201cwhich is to the detriment of the public and restrains or injures trade or commerce.\u201d Lord Atkin at p. 317, as reported, said:\u2014\nBoth the Act and the section have a legislative history, which is relevant to the discussion. Their Lordships entertain no doubt that time alone will not validate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra vires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the ultimate encroachment. But one of the questions to be considered is always whether in substance the legislation falls within an enumerated class of subject, or whether on the contrary in the guise of an enumerated class it is an encroachment on an excluded class. On this issue the legislative history may have evidential value.\nAnd His Lordship, after setting out the history of the Act and of section 498, as it stood in the Revised Statutes, 1927, distinctly stated:\u2014\nTheir Lordships have dealt at some length with the provisions of the Acts of 1919 inasmuch as the appellants relied strongly on the judgment of the Board in In re Board of Commerce Act, 1919[15], which held both Acts to be ultra vires. Unless there are material distinctions between those Acts and the present, it is plainly the duty of this Board to follow the previous decision. It is necessary therefore to contrast the provisions of the Acts of 1919 with the provisions of the Act now in dispute.\nHe then proceeded to point out that by the new Act combines were defined as combines \u201cwhich have operated or are likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers or others,\u201d and which \u201care mergers, trusts or monopolies, so-called,\u201d or result from the acquisition by any person of any control over the business of any other person or result from any agreement which has the effect of limiting facilities for production, manufacture or transport, or of fixing a common price, or enhancing the price of articles or of preventing or lessening competition in or substantially controlling production or manufacture, or \u201cotherwise restraining or injuring trade or commerce.\u201d After reviewing the provisions of the Act, His Lordship added:\u2014\nIn their Lordships\u2019 opinion s. 498 of the Criminal Code and the greater part of the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act fall within the power of the Dominion Parliament to legislate as to matters falling within the class of subjects, \u201cthe criminal law including the procedure in criminal matters\u201d (s. 91, head 27). The substance of the Act is by s. 2 to define, and by s. 32 to make criminal, combines which the legislature in the public interest intends to prohibit. The definition is wide, and may cover activities which have not hitherto been considered to be criminal. But only those combines are affected \u201cwhich have operated or are likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers, or others\u201d; and if Parliament genuinely determines that commercial activities, which can be so described, are to be suppressed in the public interest, their Lordships see no reason why Parliament should not make them crimes. \u201cCriminal law\u201d means \u201cthe criminal law in its widest sense.\u201d: Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. Co.[16]. It certainly is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any Province in 1867. The power must extend to legislation to make new crimes. Criminal law connotes only the quality of such acts or omissions as are prohibited under appropriate penal provisions by authority of the State. The criminal quality of an act cannot be discerned by intuition; nor can it be discovered by reference to any standard but one: Is the act prohibited with penal consequences? Morality and criminality are far from co-extensive; nor is the sphere of criminality necessarily part of a more extensive field covered by morality\u2014unless the moral code necessarily disapproves all acts prohibited by the State, in which case the argument moves in a circle. It appears to their Lordships to be of little value to seek to confine crimes to a category of acts which by their very nature belong to the domain of \u201ccriminal jurisprudence\u201d; for the domain of criminal jurisprudence can only be ascertained by examining what acts at any particular period are declared by the State to be crimes, and the only common nature they will be found to possess is that they are prohibited by the State and that those who commit them are punished. Their Lordships agree with the view expressed in the judgment of Newcombe J. that the passage in the judgment of the Board in the Board of Commerce case[17], to which allusion has been made, was not intended as a definition. In that case their Lordships appear to have been contrasting two matters\u2014one obviously within the line, the other obviously outside it. For this purpose it was clearly legitimate to point to matters which are such serious breaches of any accepted code of morality as to be obviously crimes when they are prohibited under penalties. The contrast is with matters which are merely attempts to interfere with Provincial rights, and are sought to be justified under the head of \u201ccriminal law\u201d colourably and merely in aid of what is in substance an encroachment.\nI do not think it can fairly be said that any of the passages which I have quoted at such length from Lord Atkin\u2019s speech were intended to disapprove of anything previously laid down in the judgments of the Board in either the Board of Commerce or the Reciprocal Insurers case[18]. The most that can be said is that Their Lordships agreed that the allusion which Lord Haldane made in the Board of Commerce case[19] to Parliament exercising \u201cexclusive legislative power where the subject matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence\u201d was not intended as a definition of criminal law as used in 91 (27), and that the quoted reference was made merely for the purpose of illustrating the difference between Parliament legislating genuinely on a matter which was obviously one of criminal law and legislating on a matter which was merely a colourable attempt to encroach upon provincial legislative jurisdiction. I think the same thing may be said of the observations which Lord Atkin himself made regarding the quality of a criminal act, that none of those observations were intended to lay down definitely the principle that the mere fact of Parliament prohibiting an act and attaching penal sanctions thereto must in all cases be taken as conclusive evidence of the criminal character of any legislation, the constitutional validity of which is called in question. Indeed, the whole judgment, in my opinion, indicates quite the contrary. One cannot read it throughout without seeing that the Board in that case itself considered very carefully the character of the legislation there under review in determining whether or not it was or was not genuine criminal legislation within the meaning of 91 (27). Indeed, the decision, in my opinion, far from modifying, actually confirms the principle laid down in the previous cases, as witness the statement that \u201cone of the questions to be considered,\u201d in case of controversy between the two legislative powers \u201cis always whether in substance the legislation falls within an enumerated class of subject or whether, on the contrary, in the guise of an enumerated class it is an encroachment on an excluded class.\u201d\nI cannot therefore agree to the proposition that the jurisdiction of Parliament in relation to criminal law is plenary and that enactments passed within the scope of that jurisdiction are not subject to review by the courts, if by that it is meant to say that the courts have no right to review the quality and character of any legislation which Parliament chooses to place in the criminal code. Once it is determined that any such legislation in reality is of a criminal character, the courts of course will not presume to consider its wisdom or unwisdom, but in my opinion it is not only their right, but their clear duty to scrutinize any enactments, which are inserted in the criminal code, for the purpose of deciding whether they are or are not of such a quality or character as can properly be described as criminal law within the meaning of s. 91 (27). I can conceive of no other way in which a controversy as to legislative jurisdiction to enact a criminal law within the meaning of s. 91 (27) can properly be decided. If the mere fact of its enactment is itself to be regarded by the courts as conclusive, there would, as pointed out in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case[20], be no class of civil rights over which the Parliament of Canada could not assume exclusive legislative control by the mere device of declaring those persons to be guilty of a criminal offence who in the exercise of such rights do not observe the conditions imposed by the Dominion.\nHaving examined the three subsections, which Parliament added to s. 498 of the Criminal Code, as we must do in order to determine their purpose and effect and answer the question, which the Governor in Council has submitted to us in regard to them, I have concluded that (b) and (c) allege offences which might reasonably be held to be of a criminal character, inasmuch as both require a specific intent to destroy competition or to eliminate a competitor\u2014a thing which is bound in the end to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public. The essential ingredient of the offence, as described in each of these subsections, is the intent to cause injury to the public or to an individual. They both, therefore, present on their face the characteristic feature of crime, viz: the intent to do wrong. In this respect they are in marked contrast with (a), which purports to make it a crime for anyone to be a party to any transaction of sale, which discriminates to his knowledge against the competitors of the purchaser in that any discount, rebate or allowance is granted to the purchaser, over and above any discount, rebate or allowance available at the time to such competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like quality or quantity. No intent to destroy competition or to eliminate an individual competitor is required. On the contrary its apparent object is to prevent the granting of discounts, rebates or allowances to large scale purchasers of manufactured and all other goods for any reason whatever and to make the price of commodities uniform, as far as possible, and by this expedient to raise retail prices throughout the country and thus to deprive the great mass of the consuming population of the benefit of real competition in trade. Such a policy may be desirable and beneficial to a particular class of the population, but its purpose and effect is purely economic and involves the virtual control by Parliament of such subjects as contracts of sale, which the B.N.A. Act has assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislatures, which, in my judgment, if I may say so, are in a much better position to deal with such subjects as matters of local and provincial concern than the federal Parliament. The crucial question, however, with which we are called upon to deal is as to whether such agreements as those described in (a) can legitimately be classed as falling under the head of criminal law. In my opinion s.s. (a) describes an act, which lacks every element of what is ordinarily associated with criminal law, either in the minds of lawyers or of laymen. It describes a thing which is neither civilly nor moraly wrong in itself under the cloak of discrimination. I have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion it is not genuine criminal legislation and that, dealing as it does with a subject matter of such a character, its incorporation in the criminal code should be held to be a mere colourable attempt on the part of Parliament to encroach upon the legislative authority of the provinces.\nI shall, therefore, answer the question which has been submitted to us in respect of these enactments that s.s. (a) of 498A of the Criminal Code is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 310.\n[2] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[3] (1883) 9 A.C. 117.\n[4] [1932] A.C. 41, at 53.\n[5] [1924] A.C. 328.\n[6] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[7] (1918) 247 U.S. 251.\n[8] [1892] A.C. 437.\n[9] [1921] 2 A.C. 100.\n[10] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[11] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[12] [1924] A.C. 328.\n[13] [1931] A.C. 310.\n11 [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[14] [1924] A.C. 328.\n[15] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[16] [1903] A.C. 524.\n[17] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[18] [1924] A.C. 328.\n[19] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[20] [1924] A.C. 328.\n",

Collins died intestate leaving a widow without issue. The chief asset of the estate was 256,017 shares in B.C. Nickel Mines, Limited. The appellants, nephew and niece of the deceased, claimed that they were entitled to share in the estate, which they alleged would exceed $20,000, on the ground that at the date of the death the market value of these shares was 29 cents per share. It was held by the trial judge and affirmed by the appellate court that the net value of the estate should be ascertained as of the date of the deceased's death and that 5 1\/2 cents per share was the outside price at which the shares could have been realized upon at that time and that the widow, now respondent, was entitled to the whole estate.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (50 B.C. Rep. 122) that the finding of the trial judge as to the value of the shares (this being an issue of fact), in which the appellate court concurred, ought not to be set aside. The price at which shares are selling on the stock market might be regarded as prima facie evidence of the value of those shares but such evidence ought not to be accepted as conclusive by the courts. Untermeyer Estate v. Attorney-General for British Columbia ([1929] S.C.R. 84) discussed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Murphy J.[2] , on an issue between the parties on the question of the value of a deceased's estate.\nD. K. MacTavish for the appellants.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered orally by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014It will not be necessary to call on you, Mr. Robertson.\nThis appeal concerns the application of section 114 of the British Columbia Administration Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 5, as amended by statute of 1925, c. 2, s. 4. The controversy on the appeal relates to the value of certain shares in the British Columbia Nickel Mines Ltd. which constituted the estate of the deceased George Henry Collins. The enactment which is to be applied is that where a testator dies intestate leaving a widow but no issue, and the net value of the estate does not exceed $20,000, the estate shall go to the widow.\nThe learned trial judge held that these shares had a certain value on the relevant date, 6th August, 1933. There was an appeal taken from that to the Court of Appeal which was dismissed, one judge dissenting. The sole question is whether the finding of the learned trial judge as to value, in which the Court of Appeal concurred, ought to be set aside. The rule, of course, is well settled and is that where there is a concurrent finding on an issue of fact this Court will not interfere unless some definite error is shown to affect the conclusion at which the courts below arrived.\nThe appeal is supported by reference to the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Mignault in the case of Untermeyer Estate v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[3] . The controversy there related to the value of certain shares which had to be ascertained for the purpose of applying the Succession Duty Act. The phrase used in the statute was \" fair market value,\" and the question at issue was as to the fair market value at the date of the death of the deceased. In the circumstances of that case, it was thought that the proper criterion of value was the price at which the shares were selling at the relevant date on the market.\nWhat is laid down in the judgment of Mr. Justice Mignault there cannot be treated as establishing a general principle of law applicable to all cases. The words which we are to apply in this case are not identical with the words under consideration in that case, but, even if they were, the question being a question of fact, the determination in that case would not necessarily rule the decision in this case. What the courts below had to ascertain was the real value of the shares at the pertinent time. The price at which the shares were selling on the stock market might be regarded as prima facie evidence, but the British Columbia courts were quite right in declining to accept that as conclusive; and examining all the factors entering into the real value of the shares, there is no ground upon which concurrent findings of the courts could properly be disturbed.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

V, C. 59.\n1936: January. 17, 20, 22; 1936: June 17.\nConstitutional law\u2014Dominion Trade and Industry Act\u2014Constitutional validity\u2014Agreements between persons in same industry to modify undue competition\u2014National Research Council\u2014\u201cCanada Standard\u201d as trade-mark\u2014Director of Public Prosecutions.\nSection 14 of the Dominion Trade and Industry Act provides inter alia that agreements between persons engaged in any specific industry, entered into in order to modify wasteful or demoralizing competition existing in such industry, may be approved by the Governor in Council on the advice of the Commission.\nHeld that said section is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Its enactments are not necessarily incidental to the exercise of any powers of the Dominion in relation to criminal law, nor can such section be sustained as legislation in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce.\nSections 16 and 17 of the same Act enacts inter alia that, in addition to its powers and duties, under any other statute or law, the National Research Council shall, on the request of the Commission, study, investigate, report and advise upon all matters relating to commodity standards as defined in the Act; and subsection 3 of section 17 provides that such advices and reports shall be privileged.\nHeld that these two sections are intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. In view of the responsibilities of the Dominion Parliament in respect of the criminal law and trade and commerce, Parliament may exercise a wide latitude in prosecuting investigations for ascertaining the facts with regard to fraudulent commercial practices, including adulteration.\nSections 18 and 19 of the same Act provide that the words \u201cCanada standard\u201d or initials \u201cC.S.\u201d shall be a national trade-mark vested in His Majesty in the right of the Dominion of Canada which may be used only under the conditions prescribed, including the condition that the commodity, to which such trade-mark is applied, shall conform to the requirements of a commodity standard for such commodity or class of commodity established under the provisions of an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld that both sections are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. The so-called trade-mark is not a trade-mark in any proper sense of the term and the function of the letters \u201cC.S.\u201d as declared by subsection 1 of section 18 is different from the function of an ordinary trademark: that subsection is really an attempt to create a civil right of novel character and to vest it in the Crown in right of the Dominion. Subsection 2 of section 18 is also objectionable as attempting to control the exercise of a civil right in the provinces.\nSection 20 of the same Act provides that the Commission may receive complaints respecting unfair trade practices and may investigate the same and recommend prosecutions if of opinion that the practice *Present:\u2014Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ. complained of constitutes an offence against any one of the Dominion Laws mentioned in s. 2 (h) of the Act.\nHeld that such section is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada in so far as the enactments enumerated in section 2 (h) of the Act may be intra vires.\nSections 21 and 22 of the same Act provide for the appointment of an officer to be called the Director of Public Prosecutions to assist in the prosecution of offences against any of these laws mentioned in section 2 (h) of the Act.\nHeld that these sections (as applicable to the criminal offences created by such of the enactments enumerated in section 2 (h) as may be intra vires) are not ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Authority of the Parliament to enact these provisions is necessarily incidental to the exercise of legislative authority in relation to the criminal offences created by the laws \u201cprohibiting unfair trade practices\u201d validly enacted in such of the statutes enumerated in section 2 (h) as may be competent.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) of the following question: Is the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the question to the Court is as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 30th October, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935, being chapter 59 of the statutes of Canada, 1935, which was passed, as appears from the recitals contained in the preamble of the said Act, for the purpose of giving effect to certain recommendations contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Price Spreads.\nThe Minister observes that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had legislative jurisdiction to enact the said Act, either in whole or in part, and that it is expedient that such question should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following question be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act,\u2014\nIs the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSection 2 (h) of the Act, referred to in the judgment, reads as follows:\n\u201cLaws prohibiting unfair trade practices\u201d means the provisions of the Agricultural Pests Control Act, The Canada Grain Act, the Combines Investigation Act, the Dairy Industry Act, the Electrical Units Act, The Electricity Inspection Act, 1928, the Feeding Stuffs Act, the Fertilizer Act, the Fish Inspection Act, the Food and Drugs Act, The Fruit, Vegetables and Honey Act, the Gas Inspection Act, the Inspection and Sale Act, the Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act, The Maple Sugar Industry Act, 1980, the Meat and Canned Foods Act, The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1984, The Patent Act, 1985, the Petroleum and Naphtha Inspection Act, The Precious Metals Marking Act, 1928, the Proprietary or Patent Medicine Act, the Seeds Act, the Trade Mark and Design Act, The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, the Water Meters Inspection Act, the Weights and Measures Act, and of sections 404, 405, 406, 415a and 486 to 504, inclusive, of the Criminal Code, and of this Act and regulations under the said Acts, which provisions prohibit acts or omissions connected with industry as being fraudulent, misrepresentative or otherwise unfair or detrimental to the public interest.\u201d\n*The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The sections which require consideration are sections 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 and 22.\nAs to section 14, we cannot perceive any ground for holding that the enactments of this section are necessarily incidental to the exercise of any powers of the Dominion in relation to the criminal law. Nor can the section, we think, be sustained as legislation in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce consistently with the passage quoted from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Snider\u2019s case[1], in the reasons given in the judgment upon the Reference concerning the Natural Products Marketing Act. It is to be observed that this section contemplates action by the Commission and by the Governor in Council in respect of individual agreements which may relate to trade that is entirely local.\nIf confined to external trade and interprovincial trade, the section might well be competent under head no. 2 of section 91; and if the legislation were in substance concerned with such trade, incidental legislation in relation to local trade necessary in order to prevent the defeat of competent provisions might also be competent; but as it stands, we think this section is invalid.\nAs regards sections 16 and 17, it would appear that in view of the responsibilities of the Dominion Parliament in respect of the criminal law and trade and commerce, Parliament may (as seems to be suggested by the judgments of the Judicial Committee in the Board of Commerce case[2] and in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada[3], exercise a wide latitude in prosecuting investigations for ascertaining the facts with regard to fraudulent commercial practices, including adulteration; for that reason we think these two sections, 16 and 17, are intra vires. Subsection 3 of section 17 would seem to be reasonably ancillary to the principal provisions of the two sections.\nAs to sections 18 and 19, it is not necessary to pass upon the question whether or not the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion extends to the subject of trade marks in virtue of subdivision 2 of section 91, \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d The so-called trade mark is not a trade mark in any proper sense of the term. The function of a trade mark is to indicate the origin of goods placed on the market and the protection given to a trade mark is intended to be a protection to the producer or seller of his reputation in his trade. The function of the letters \u201cC.S.,\u201d as declared by section 18 (1), is something altogether different. That subsection is really an attempt to create a civil right of novel character and to vest it in the Crown in right of the Dominion. Generally speaking, except when legislating in respect of matters falling within the enumerated subjects of section 91, Parliament possesses no competence to create a civil right of a new kind which, if validly created, would be a civil right within the scope and meaning of head no. 13 of section 92. The second subsection is also objectionable as attempting to control the exercise of a civil right in the provinces.\nSection 19 is merely subsidiary to section 18 and necessarily falls with it.\nThe first part of section 20 would appear to be unobjectionable as respects enactments mentioned in section 2 (h) which may be intra vires of Parliament. As regards the validity of these enactments we have only heard argument in respect of two of them; the Natural Products Marketing Act and section 498A of the Criminal Code. We have elsewhere given our reasons for considering the first of these ultra vires. As to the second of them (section 498A of the Criminal Code) a majority of the Court hold that section to be intra vires in its entirety (Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting as to subsection (a) of that section).\nAs to sections 21 and 22, it would appear that authority to enact these provisions is necessarily incidental to the exercise of legislative authority in relation to the criminal offences created by the laws \u201cprohibiting unfair trade practices\u201d validly enacted in such of the statutes enumerated in section 2 (h) as may be competent. We do not think it can be said that the authortiy to provide for the prosecution of criminal offences falls \u201cstrictly\u201d within the subject \u201cCriminal law and criminal procedure,\u201d\u2014head 27 of the enumerated heads of section 91; but our view is that the authority to make such provision, and the authority to enact conditions in respect of the institution and the conduct of criminal proceedings is necessarily incidenal to the powers given to the Parliament of Canada under head no. 27 (Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada)[4].\nThis reasoning would appear to apply to the question of the validity of subsection 1 of section 15 and the second part of section 20, which, accordingly, seem to be valid.\n* Reporter\u2019s note: Counsel on the argument of this Reference were the same as those mentioned at p. 365.\n[1] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[2] [1922] 1 A.C. 191, at 201.\n[3] [1931] A.C. 310.\n[4] (1931) A.C. 310, at 326-7.\n",

If the proposal is accepted by the ordinary creditors and the secured creditors whose rights are affected concur, it is submitted to the Court for approval. If it is not accepted by the ordinary creditors or if a secured creditor whose rights are affected by it does not concur, the matter is referred to a Board of Review to formulate a proposal. If the proposal is accepted by the creditors and approved by the Court, or if it is formulated by the Board of Review and is approved by the creditors and the debtor, or if, though not so approved, it is confirmed by the Board of Review, it shall be binding upon all the creditors and the debtor.\nHeld, Cannon J. dissenting, that the Act is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. The power of the Parliament to enact this statute is derived from subdivision 21 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, in virtue of which the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to the subject of Bankruptcy and Insolvency. The provisions of the statute affect farmers who are in such a situation that they are unable to pay their debts as they fall due; and it is competent to Parliament, possessing plenary authority in respect of bankruptcy and insolvency, to treat this condition of affairs as a state of insolvency.\nPer Cannon J. dissenting:\u2014In view of the accepted aims and past history of the bankruptcy and insolvency legislation, the Parliament of Canada, in enacting the Act, has exceeded the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency to which its jurisdiction is limited. More particularly, the Act does not provide, as in the case of an insolvent person, for the rateable distribution of the assets of the debtor among his creditors nor for the discharge of the debt. Section 17 of the Act, which fixes the rate of interest, is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada under ss. 19 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) of the following question: Is the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as amended by the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935, or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the question to the Court reads as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 13th November, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, chapter 53 of the statutes of Canada, 1934, being an Act to Facilitate Compromises and Arrangements between Farmers and their Creditors, and to its amending Act, The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935, chapter 20 of the statutes of Canada, 1935, the principal of which Acts was enacted as appears from the preamble thereof upon the recital that in view of the depressed state of agriculture the present indebtedness of many farmers was beyond their capacity to pay; that it was essential in the interest of the Dominion to retain the farmers on the land as efficient producers and for such purpose it was necessary to provide means whereby compromises or rearrangements might be effected of debts of farmers who were unable to pay.\nThe Minister states that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to enact the said Acts; or either of them, in whole or in part, and that it is expedient that such question should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following question be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to Section 55 of the Supreme Court Act:\u2014\nIs the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as amended by the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935, or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council. The counsel mentioned in the report of the judgments on the Reference re Section 498A of the Criminal Code (p. 365) appeared on this Reference, except that Aim\u00e9 Geo ff non K.C. for Quebec and G. McG. Sloan K.C., (Attorney-General) and J. W. deB Farris K.C. for British Columbia were not present; and J. L. Ralston K.C. appeared for the Attorneys-General for Quebec and British Columbia.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The title of the Act, which is really an office consolidation of a statute of 1934 with another of 1935, is \u201cAn Act to facilitate compromises and arrangements between farmers and their creditors.\u201d\nThe Act provides a procedure whereby a farmer may make a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement to his creditors. If the proposal is accepted by the ordinary creditors, and secured creditors whose rights are affected agree to it, it is submitted to the Court for approval. If it is not accepted by the ordinary creditors, or if a secured creditor whose rights are affected does not agree, there is a reference to a board of review to formulate a proposal. If a proposal is formulated by the board of review and approved by the creditors and the debtor; or if, though not so approved, it is confirmed by the board of review, it is binding on all the creditors and the debtor.\n\u201cFarmer\u201d means \u201ca person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil.\u201d \u201cCreditor\u201d includes \u201csecured creditor.\u201d\nSubsection 2 of section 2 makes the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and rules applicable and is in these words:\nUnless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires, expressions contained in this Act shall have the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act, and this Act shall be read and construed as one with the Bankruptcy Act, but shall have full force and effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Bankruptcy Act, and the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and Bankruptcy Rules shall, except as in this Act otherwise provided, apply mutatis mutandis in the case of proceedings hereunder including meetings of creditors.\nWe are chiefly concerned with the provisions with regard to compositions. It is provided that a farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due may make a proposal for a composition, an extension of time or scheme of arrangement, and file a proposal with the Official Receiver who shall forthwith call a meeting of the creditors.\nThe Official Receiver is to perform the duties and functions required by the Bankruptcy Act to be performed by a trustee in the case of a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement. These duties and functions are, generally, the submission to the meeting of the proposal, and, on its acceptance by the creditors, the application to the Court to approve it. A proposal may be one in relation to a debt owing to a secured creditor or owing to a person who has acquired property subject to a right of redemption, but except in the case of a proposal confirmed by the Board of Review, the concurrence of such creditor is required. Such a creditor, if the proposal relates to the debt owing to him, may value his security, and is entitled to vote only in respect of the balance of his claim after deducting the amount of his valuation, but no proposal is to be approved by the Court which provides for payment in excess of the valuation.\nThe provisions of the Bankruptcy Act preventing the approval of a proposal which does not provide for a payment of not less than fifty cents on the dollar, and priority of payment of certain debts are made inapplicable. Power is given to the Court to order a farmer to execute instruments necessary to give effect to the proposal when it has received the approval of the Court or the confirmation of the Board of Review. On the filing of a proposal, the property of the debtor is deemed to be under the authority of the Court, and creditors\u2019 remedies may not be exercised without leave of the Court for ninety days, or such further time as the Court may order.\nProvision is made for the establishment in any province of a Board of Review consisting of a Chief Commissioner, who must be a Judge having jurisdiction in bankruptcy, and two Commissioners, one as representative of creditors and one as representative of debtors. When the Official Receiver reports that no proposal has been approved by the creditors, although one has been made, the Board, on the written request of a creditor or the debtor, is required to endeavour to formulate an acceptable proposal, and to consider representations by the parties interested. If any such proposal is approved by the creditors and the debtor, it is binding on them. If such a proposal is not approved, the Board may confirm it and it becomes binding upon all the creditors and the debtor. The full Board must deal with every request to formulate a proposal, and the determination of the majority prevails. The Board must base its proposal upon the present and prospective capability of the debtor to perform the obligations prescribed and the productive value of the farm, and may decline to formulate a proposal where it does not consider it can do so in fairness and justice to the debtor and the creditors. The Board is invested with the powers of a Commissioner appointed under the Inquiries Act. Special provision is made for insolvent farmer debtors residing in Quebec, whereby they may make an assignment for the general benefit of their creditors.\nSection 17 provides that whenever any rate of interest exceeding seven per cent is stipulated for in any mortgage of farm real estate, after tender or payment of the amount owing, together with three months\u2019 further interest, no interest, after the expiry of the three months, shall be chargeable at any rate in excess of five per cent per annum.\nAs above mentioned, the provisions of the statute are made a part of the general system for the administration of the assets of bankrupts and insolvents established by the Bankruptcy Act; and they come into operation only where a farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due makes a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement.\nThe grounds upon which the validity of the statute is impeached are, mainly, two: First, it is argued that it is not competent to the Parliament of Canada, in exercising its powers in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency, to enact legislation depriving a secured creditor of his right to realize his security fully for the recovery of the debt owing to him, where such security consists of a conventional charge upon the property of the insolvent or affecting that right by subjecting him in respect of it to the discretionary order of a tribunal.\nSecond, it is contended that the Parliament of Canada is incompetent to legislate in such a way as to affect the rights of the government of a province as creditor of an insolvent in the manner in which this statute professes to do. The general scope of the jurisdiction in relation to bankruptcy or insolvency conferred under section 91 is thus described by Lord Selburne in L\u2019Union St. Jacques v. B\u00e9lisle[1]:\u2014\nThe words describe in their own legal sense provisions made by law for the administration of the estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent, according to rules and definitions prescribed by law, including of course the conditions in which that law is to be brought into operation, the manner in which it is to be brought into operation, and the effect of its operation.\nThese words would indicate that Parliament, in providing for the administration of the estates of bankrupts and insolvents, has a very wide discretion and is not necessarily limited in the exercise of that discretion by reference to the particular provisions of bankruptcy legislation in England prior to the date of the B.N.A. Act. It is not necessary, however, for the purpose of passing upon the validity of this statute to determine to what extent Parliament is empowered, when making provision for the administration of such estates, to depart from the broad lines of such legislation as known and understood in 1867.\nIt is not open to dispute in this Court that legislation in respect of \u201ccompositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law \u201c(In re Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act[2]. Nor can the authority of Parliament be controverted to enact provisions by which the security of a creditor of an insolvent may be prejudicially affected without his consent. That was decided in the case just referred to. By the statute under consideration on that reference, it is enacted (section 4) that\nWhere a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a debtor company and its secured creditors or any class of them, the court may, on the application, in a summary way of the company or of any such creditor or of the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator of the company, order a meeting of such creditors, or class of creditors, and, if the court so determines, of the shareholders of such company, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs.\nBy section 5 it is provided that,\nIf a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors, or class of creditors, as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or meetings thereof respectively held pursuant to sections three and four of this Act, or either of such sections, agree to any compromise or arrangement either as proposed . . . . or modified at such meeting or meetings, the compromise or arrangement may be sanctioned by the court, and if so sanctioned shall be binding on all the creditors, or the class of creditors, as the case may be, and on any trustee for any such\u201d class of creditors, whether secured or unsecured, as the case may be, and shall also be binding on the company. \u2026\n\u201cSecured creditors\u201d include the \u201cholder of a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege on or against, or any assignment, cession or transfer of, all or any property of a debtor company as security for indebtedness of the debtor company. \u2026\u201d\nIn the case mentioned, this statute was held to be intra vires. The decision necessarily involves the proposition that Parliament may legislate in such a way as to make the terms of a compromise, to which a majority of three-fourths in value of secured creditors, or any class of secured creditors, in the sense mentioned, are parties, where the composition has received judicial sanction, binding upon a secured creditor who is not a party to the composition and has not given his assent to it. The principle of the legislation, in a word, is that a secured creditor under the conditions mentioned may be required by law to accept a composition to which he has not given his assent.\nIt has, of course, been a familiar characteristic of the operation of bankruptcy and insolvency legislation that a creditor possessing security on the property of his debtor in virtue of a judgment or of an execution should lose his privileged position to the extent to which the judgment or execution remains unsatisfied on bankruptcy supervening. But the argument under consideration distinguishes between the kind of security given by law to a judgment creditor and a conventional security and, in particular, a security in the nature of mortgage. From the point of view of the judgment creditor, the distinction, perhaps, does not rest upon very satisfactory grounds. It was at one time the law in some of the provinces of Canada that a judgment registered in a land registry office constituted a charge upon the lands of the judgment debtor enforceable in the same manner as an equitable charge for securing the payment of money; and a confession of judgment at one time was a form of security well known. Such security, although it derived its effectiveness from the privileges conferred by the law upon judgment creditors, had its origin in convention. Moreover, the judgment creditor who, by the law of the province, is the holder of a hypothec upon the lands of the judgment debtor or by virtue of the registration of his judgment, has what amounts to an equitable charge upon such lands may-suffer as great a deprivation by bankruptcy legislation which takes away his privilege upon a supervening bankruptcy as would a mortgagee affected in the same way. Nevertheless, it is true that, traditionally, mortgages have not, by bankruptcy legislation, been prejudicially affected in their right to resort to their securities.\nMr. Rowell has called our attention to section IX of chapter 19 (21 Jac. 1), and it appears that from the date of that enactment (1623) down to 1869, English bankruptcy legislation has contained a substantially similar provision. The section is in these words:\u2014\nIX. And, for the better division and distribution of the lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels and other estate of such bankrupt, to and amongst his or her creditors; Be it enacted, That \u2026; and that all and every creditor and creditors having security for his or their several debts, by judgment, statute, recognizance, specialty with penalty or without penalty, or other security, or having no security, or having made attachments in London, or any other place, by virtue of any custom there used, of the goods and chattels of any such bankrupt, whereof there is no execution or extent served and executed upon any of the lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and other estate of such bankrupts, before such time as he or she shall or do become bankrupt, shall not be relieved upon any such judgment, statute, recognizance, specialty, attachments, or other security for any more than a rateable part of their just and due debts, with the other creditors of the said bankrupt, without respect to any such penalty or greater sum contained in any such judgment, statute, recognizance, specialty with penalty, attachment or other security.\nBy force of another section of the same statute, mortgages of real or personal property are not within the general words \u201cother security.\u201d The section in itself, however, is of significance. Among the securities mentioned are \u201cstatutes and recognizances.\u201d\nStatutes merchant and statutes staple are discussed by Blackstone (Ed. 1766, Clarendon Press, Vol. II, ch. 10, s. 4, p. 160). This section is devoted to one species of estates defeasible on condition and is preceded, in section 3, by a discussion of estates held in vadio, or pledge, which are said to be of two kinds\u2014vivum va dium, or living pledge, and mortuum vadium, or dead pledge or mortgage. These sections (3 and 4) are introduced thus:\nThere are some estates defeasible upon condition subsequent, that require a more peculiar notice. Such are\nSection 4 is in these words:\nA fourth species of estates, defeasible on condition subsequent, are those held by statute merchant, and statute staple; which are very nearly related to the vivum vadium before mentioned, or estate held till the profits thereof shall discharge a debt liquidated or ascertained. For both the statute merchant and statute staple are securities for money; the one entered into pursuant to the statute 13 Edward I de marcatoribus, and thence called a statute merchant; the other pursuant to the statute 27 Edw. III, c. 9, before the mayor of the staple, that is to say, the grand mart for the principal commodities or manufactures of the kingdom formerly held by act of parliament in certain trading towns, and thence this security is called a statute staple. They are both, I say, securities for debts, originally permitted only among traders, for the benefit of commerce; whereby the lands of the debtor are conveyed to the creditor, till out of the rents and profits of them his debt may be satisfied: and during such time as the creditor so holds the lands, he is tenant by statute merchant or statute staple. There is also a similar security, the recognizance in the nature of a statute staple, which extends the benefit of this mercantile transaction to all the king\u2019s subjects in general, by virtue of the statute 23 Hen. VIII, c. 6.\nThe statutes which introduced these forms of securities were repealed in 1863. These securities, it should be observed, were effected by recognizance, the debtor\u2019s lands being bound as from the date of the recognizance. Blackstone, however, treats the security as one arising from conveyance, and Blackstone may be safely accepted as giving the current professional view of such transactions. The effect of the section quoted was that the holders of such securities were put in the same position as a judgment creditor; and upon bankruptcy a creditor holding such a security ranked on the assets rateably with unsecured creditors.\nEven if it were open to us to depart from our recent decision in the reference concerning the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act[3], we should, treating the matter as res integra, have thought that the history of bankruptcy legislation down to the year 1867 would not justify a conclusion that provisions such as those in the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, or those in the statute before us dealing with secured creditors were provisions beyond the discretion of Parliament to incorporate in a system for the administration of the estates of insolvents.\nBefore turning to the second ground upon which the legislation is attacked, it is convenient to refer to the nature of the proposal which is authorized in the case of secured creditors. That appears from section 7 which is in these words:\n7. A proposal may provide for a compromise or an extension of time or a scheme of arrangement in relation to a debt owing to a secured creditor, or in relation to a debt owing to a person who has acquired movable or immovable property subject to a right of redemption, but in that event the concurrence of the secured creditor or such person, shall be required, except in the case of a proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review as hereinafter provided.\nIt will be observed that the character of proposal contemplated in such cases is strictly limited to one which provides for a compromise, an extension of time or scheme of arrangement in relation to a debt owing to the secured creditor. The statute apparently, as counsel for the Dominion argued, does not envisage any interference with the rights of secured creditors except in relation to the debts owing to them and then (in the absence of the assent of the creditor) only to a compromise or extension of time or scheme of arrangement embodied in the proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review.\nAs to the second ground of objection, the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Re Silver Brothers[4] seems very clearly to lay down and decide that it is competent to the Dominion, in legislating in relation to bankruptcy or insolvency, to deal with the privilege attaching to debts owing to the Crown in the right of a province and to take away any priority accorded to such debts by the law of a province. The legislative authority in bankruptcy matters to deal with debts owing to a province is no less than the authority to deal with debts owing to the Dominion.\nTo summarize: The power to enact this statute is derived from subdivision 21 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act\u2014in virtue of which the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to the subject of Bankruptcy and Insolvency. The broad purpose of the statute is, in the words of the title, \u201cto facilitate compromises and arrangements between farmers and their creditors.\u201d The provisions of the statute affect farmers who are in such a situation that they are unable to pay their debts as they fall due. It is competent to Parliament, possessing plenary authority in respect of bankruptcy and insolvency, to treat this condition of affairs as a state of insolvency. The provisions of the statute only come into operation where such a state of insolvency exists. Prima facie, therefore, it is, within the ordinary meaning of the words, a statute dealing with insolvency. The statute is, by its express terms, incorporated into the general system of bankruptcy legislation in force in Canada and it is not open to dispute that legislation in respect of \u201ccompositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law\u201d (see page 5 of the judgment).\nIt is contended on behalf of the provinces that the jurisdiction of the Dominion in relation to this subject is limited to the enactment of legislation which at least in its broad lines, conforms to the systems of bankruptcy and insolvency legislation which had prevailed in Great Britain or in Canada down to the time of the passing of the B.N.A. Act. We do not consider it necessary to decide upon the question whether or not the powers vested in Parliament in relation to this subject are for all time restricted by reference to the legislative practice which obtained prior to the passing of the B.N.A. Act. The attack upon the statute was mainly directed against the provision which makes it possible to force the terms of a composition upon a secured creditor by which a secured creditor may be compelled to submit to a reduction of the debt owing to him by the insolvent.\nThis is not a new feature of insolvency legislation although, down to the enactment of the Companies\u2019 Creditors-Arrangement Act in 1933, mortgagees had never been by legislation placed in such a position. The statute now under consideration does not in this respect differ from the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act and the principle of our decision on the Reference respecting that statute[5] is applicable; that this, although a departure from previous practice in bankruptcy or insolvency legislation, was not beyond the discretionary authority bestowed upon Parliament under head no. 21 of section 91.\nThe statute being intra vires, the interrogatory addressed to us should be answered in the negative.\nCannon J.\u2014This Court, on a previous reference reached the conclusion that the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act5, 23-24 Geo. V, ch. 36, was intra vires of the Parliament of Canada because the matters dealt with came within the domain of \u201cbankruptcy and insolvency\u201d within the intent of sec. 91, par. 21, of the B.N.A. Act. The Chief Justice said at p. 662:\u2014\nIt seems difficult, therefore, to suppose that the purpose of the legislation is to give sanction to arrangements in the exclusive interest of a single creditor or of a single class of creditors and having no relation to the benefit of creditors as a whole. The ultimate purpose would appear to be to enable the court to sanction a compromise which, although binding upon a class of creditors only, would be beneficial to the general body of creditors as well as to the shareholders.\nIn my judgment, with the concurrence of Lamont, J., I found that arrangements, as provided for by the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, are, and have been, before and since Confederation component part of any system \u201cdevised to protect the creditors and at the same time help the honest debtor to rehabilitate himself and obtain a discharge.\u201d\nIn the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Badgley, whose conclusions were subsequently upheld by the Privy Council, re L\u2019Union St. Jacques & B\u00e9lisie6, I find the following at pp. 455 & 456:\u2014\nA statutory bankrupt and insolvent legislation had been in force in the two Canadas since the first Insolvent Act of 1864, which was continued with amendments to the time of the making of the Dominion Law of Insolvency in 1869, which repealed the provincial enactments and substituted a general Dominion Law upon the subject. By the Provincial Act of 1864, the first section specially enacts that \u201cthe Act should apply in Lower Canada to traders only\u201d \u201cAnd in Upper Canada to all persons whether traders or not,\u201d and this provision was not interfered with in the subsequent statutory amendments of that Provincial Act.\nBy the Dominion \u201cAct respecting Insolvency\u201d of 1869, the Lower Canada statutory restriction is extended throughout the Dominion of the four provinces, and it is enacted by the first section of the Dominion Act of 1869. \u201cThis Act shall apply to traders only.\u201d Now it is nothing but just to read the general subject of bankruptcy and insolvency by the light of the Dominion legislation itself, as indicating the intent of that legislature as to the enumerated subjects for its action, and it becomes undeniable therefore, that the Society, the appellant here, comes within the express limitation and restriction of the general law, and being neither in character nor purpose commercial nor a trader, and solely and simply what it has always been, a charitable and eleemosynary institution in and for the province of Quebec, the provincial enactment for its relief can, under no circumstances be brought within the operation of the laws of Bankruptcy and Insolvency attributed to the Dominion legislature.\nIt must also be borne in mind that a farmer, before and since Confederation, as far as the province of Quebec was concerned, even when insolvent, was not subject to bankruptcy proceedings; he could not be compelled to assign in the other provinces, where he could voluntarily make an assignment for the distribution of his assets among his creditors, but could not be forced into insolvency. This latter provision was first made applicable to Quebec in 1919, but a special provision was subsequently passed to withdraw it from its operation. (1919, ch. 36, sec. 9; 1923, ch. 31, sec. 11; 1932, ch. 39, sec. 6.)\nIt may be reasonably said, as a matter of history, that nobody contemplated for a long period after Confederation that \u201cbankruptcy or insolvency\u201d proceedings and their essentially compulsory features could or would apply to farmers.\nBut the paramount consideration is that the Act which we are considering lacks the essential elements of bankruptcy legislation, to wit: the distribution of the debtor\u2019s, assets rateably among his creditors, in the case of an insolvent person, whether he is willing that his assets be so distributed or not. Although provision may be made for a voluntary assignment as an alternative, it is only as an alternative. See: Voluntary Assignment case, Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada7:\nThe Act does not provide for the rateable distribution of the assets of the debtor nor for the discharge of the debt. On the contrary, the only aim of the Act is to keep the farmer on his land at the expense of his creditors; the proposal for arrangement must come from him and\u2019 covers only a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement either before or after an assignment has been made.\nAnother difference with the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act is found in an entirely new feature which, gives the Board of Review, under clause 12, paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9, extraordinary powers:\u2014\n(6) If the creditors or the debtor decline to approve the proposal so formulated, the Board may nevertheless confirm such proposal, either as formulated or as amended by the Board, in which case it shall be approved by the Court and shall be binding upon all the creditors and the debtor as in the case of a proposal duly accepted by the creditors and approved by the court.\n(7) Every request to formulate a proposal shall be dealt with by the full Board, but a determination of the majority shall be deemed to be the determination of the Board. (8) The Board shall base its proposal upon the present and prospective capability of the debtor to perform the obligations prescribed and the productive value of the farm.\n(9) The Board may decline to formulate a proposal in any case where it does not consider that it can do so in fairness and justice to the debtor or the creditors.\nThese evidently are not provisions similar to what we considered proper proceedings in insolvency in the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, because they lack the essential element of a compromise: the mutual agreement of the debtor and of at least a fixed majority of the creditors.\nUnder subsection 6, the Board may impose an entirely new contract to the parties, confiscate, if they deem it advisable, in whole or in part, the principal due to the creditors and consider only under subsection 12, sec. (8), the present and prospective capability of the debtor to perform the obligation prescribed by the Board and the productive value of the farm, which is not to be considered as an asset to be distributed among the creditors but as an intangible and unseizable asset reserved for the enjoyment and protection of the debtor.\nIn the judgment of Lord Selborne in L\u2019Union St, Jacques v. B\u00e9lisie8, we find, at page 38:\u2014\nThe fact that this particular society appears to have been in a state of embarrassment, and in such a financial condition that unless relieved by legislation, it might have been likely to come to ruin, does not prove that it was in any legal sense within the category of insolvency. And in point of fact the whole tendency of the Act is to keep it out of that category, and not to bring it into it. The Act does not terminate the company; it does not propose a final distribution of its assets on the footing of insolvency or bankruptcy; it does not wind it up. On the contrary, it contemplates its going on, and possibly at some future time recovering its prosperity and then these creditors, who seem on the face of the Act to be somewhat summarily interfered with, are to be reinstated.\nTheir Lordships were clearly of opinion that this was not a case for insolvency legislation, but a local and private matter within the provincial jurisdiction.\nApplying this test, I would say that the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act is one which might be within the competence of the provincial legislature, for the same reasons, applicable in each province to each individual farmer who finds himself in difficulties, which then applied to L\u2019Union St. Jacques, in order to enable him to carry on and, possibly at some future time, to recover his prosperity. But I cannot in view of the accepted aims and past history of the bankruptcy and insolvency legislation, reach the conclusion that Parliament, in passing this legislation, did not exceed the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency, to which its jurisdiction is limited. It has set up a charitable or eleemosynary institution, to be established in each separate province by proclamation; such . local charities are to be established, maintained and managed under provincial legislation by virtue of 92 (7). The legislation has nothing to do directly with agriculture, with the science, the art or the process of supplying human wants by raising the products of the soil.\nI answer the question in the affirmative, for the whole Act excepting clause 17 which fixes the rate of interest, under certain conditions which do not clearly exceed the powers of Parliament under 91 (19).\n[1] (1875) L.R. 6 P.C. 31, at 36.\n[2] [1934] S.C.R. 659.\n[3] [1934] S.C.R. 659.\n[4] [1932] A.C. 514, at 519-521.\n[5] [1934] S.C.R. 659.\n5 [1934] S.C.R. 659.\n6 (1872) 2 Rev.

The powers of regulation vested in the commissions extend to external trade and matters connected therewith and to trade in matters of interprovincial concern; but also to trade which is entirely local and of purely local concern. Regulation of individual trades, or trades in individual commodities in this sweeping fashion, is not competent to the Parliament of Canada and such a scheme of regulation is not practicable \u201cin view of the distribution of legislative powers enacted by the Constitution Act, without the co-operation of the provincial legislatures\u201d (Board of Commerce case, [1922] 1 A.C. 191, at 201). The legislation is not valid as an exercise of the general authority of the Parliament of Canada under the introductory words of section 91, B.N.A. Act, to make laws \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada.\u201d\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), of the following question: Is The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, as amended by The Natural Products Marketing Act Amendment Act, 1935, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the question to the Court reads as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 31st October, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to the Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, being chapter 57 of the statutes of Canada, 1934, and according to its long title \u201cAn Act to improve the methods and practices of marketing of natural products in Canada and in export trade, and to make further provision in connection therewith\u201d and to its amending Act, The Natural Products Marketing Act Amendment Act, 1935, being chapter 64 of the statutes of Canada, 1935.\nThe Minister observes that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to enact the said Acts, or either of them, in whole or in part, and that it is expedient that the question should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following question be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act,\u2014\nIs The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, as amended by The Natural Products Marketing Act Amendment Act, 1935, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nThe Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, by s. 3 authorizes the Governor in Council to establish a board, consisting of such number of persons as he may from time to time determine, to be known as the Dominion Marketing Board, to regulate the marketing of natural products as in the Act provided. By s. 2(c) marketing\u2019 includes buying and selling, shipping for sale or storage and offering for sale.\u201d By s. 2(e) as amended \u201c\u2018natural product\u2019 includes animals, meats, eggs, wool, dairy products, grains, seeds, fruit and fruit products, vegetables and vegetable products, maple products, honey, tobacco, lumber and such other natural product of agriculture and of the forest, sea, lake or river and such article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product, and such article wholly or partly manufactured or derived from a product of the forest as may be designated by the Governor in Council.\u201d The powers of the Board are made exercisable in respect of a \u201cregulated product\u201d; and this expression is defined by sec. 2 (g) as follows: \u201cregulated product\u201d means a natural product to which a scheme approved under this Act relates, but does not include (i) in case the said scheme relates only to the product of a part of Canada, such product in so far as it is produced outside that part of Canada; (ii) in case the said scheme relates only to the product marketed outside the province of production, such product in so far as it is marketed within the province of production; (iii) in case the said scheme relates only to the product exported, such product in so far as it is not exported. The powers of the Board are set forth in broad terms in par. (a) of sec. 4, ss. 1, of the Act as follows: \u201cThe Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have power (a) to regulate the time and place at which, and to designate the agency through which the regulated product shall be marketed, to determine the manner of distribution, the quantity and quality, grade or class of the regulated product that shall be marketed by any person at any time, and to prohibit the marketing of any of the regulated product of any grade, quality or class.\u201d Then follows a series of paragraphs in which are more specifically described the Board\u2019s functions and powers. To exempt from any determination or order any person or class of persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product or any class, variety or grade of such product; to conduct a pool for the equalization of returns received from the sale of the regulated product and to compensate any person for loss sustained by withholding from the market or forwarding to a specified market any regulated product pursuant to an order of the Board, except in specified cases; to compensate any person in respect of any shipment made pursuant to any determination or order of the Board to a country whose currency is depreciated, in relation to Canadian currency, for loss due to such depreciation; to assist by grant or loan the construction or operation of facilities for preserving, processing, storing, or conditioning the regulated product and to assist research work relating to the marketing of such product; to require any or all persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product to register their names, addresses and occupations with the Board, or to obtain a licence from the Board, subject to cancellation for violation of any provision of the Act or regulation made thereunder; to require returns of full information relating to the production and marketing of the natural product from all persons engaged therein and to inspect the books and premises of such persons; to pay the operating and necessary expenses of the Board; to co-operate with any board or agency established to regulate the marketing of any natural product of such province and to act conjointly with any such provincial board or agency. In addition, by sec. 4, ss. 2 to 8, inclusive, the Board is empowered whenever a scheme for regulation by a local board has been approved, to authorize the local board to exercise such of the powers of the Board outlined in s. 4 as may be necessary for the proper enforcement of the scheme of regulation, and at any time to withdraw such authority from the local Board; to require the local Board to furnish full information from time to time relating to the production and marketing of the regulated product and to advise the local board in all matters relating to the exercise of its powers; to impose (whether the Board be exercising the powers conferred by this Act or by provincial legislation or whenever the Board or a local board co-operates or acts conjointly with any provincial board or agency) for the purposes of any scheme of regulation, charges and tolls in respect of the marketing of the whole or any part of the regulated product which shall be payable by such persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product as the Board decides to authorize the local board or such provincial board or agency to act as its agent to collect and disburse the charges or tolls imposed; to utilize, or authorize the local board or provincial board or agency to utilize, the fund created by charges or tolls so imposed for the purposes of such scheme of regulation including the creation of reserves; and any charge or toll so imposed by the Board is declared to be a debt due to the Board recoverable by legal action. The \u201cschemes\u201d to which the Act applies are such marketing schemes as are approved by the Governor in Council and s. 5, ss. (4) provides as follows: (4) Before any scheme is approved the Governor in Council shall be satisfied, (a) that the principal market for the natural product is outside the province of production; or \u201c(b) that some part of the product produced may be exported. Under s. 5, ss. (1) schemes may be submitted for approval by a representative number of persons engaged in the production and marketing or the production or marketing of a natural product, or under s. 9 the Minister designated by the Governor in Council to administer the Act may propose a scheme for the marketing or the regulation of the marketing of a natural product in interprovincial or export trade whenever he is satisfied that the trade and commerce in such product is injuriously affected by marketing conditions through the lack of a local board. Section 10 provides that, whenever a scheme of regulation relates to an area of production which is confined within the limits of a province, the Governor in Council may authorize any marketing board or agency established under the law of that province to be, and to exercise the functions of, a local board with reference to the said scheme. Section 11 empowers the Board to exercise any power conferred upon it by or pursuant to provincial legislation with reference to the marketing of a natural product and to authorize the local board to exercise any such power. In point of fact each of the nine provinces in 1934 passed statutes to enable their respective governments to give effect, in their respective provinces, to the provisions of the Dominion Act and regulations made thereunder. Section 12 authorizes the Governor in Council to regulate or restrict the importation into Canada of any natural product which enters Canada in competition with a regulated product or regulate or restrict the exportation from Canada of any natural product. Part II of the Act (ss. 16 to 26) provides for investigations by the Minister at the request of the Board or upon his own initiative, \u201cinto the cost of production, wages, prices, spread, trade practices, methods of financing, management, policies, grading, transportation and other matters in relation to the production and marketing, adaptation for sale, processing or conversion of any natural or regulated product.\u201d (s. 17). The term \u201cspread\u201d is defined in s. 16 (b) as follows: (b) \u201cspread\u201d means and includes: (i) the charge made by any person by way of commission, flat charge or otherwise for selling any natural or regulated product; (ii) the charge made by any person for the storage, conditioning, re-conditioning, packing, wrapping or otherwise preparing for market any natural or regulated product; (iii) the difference or spread between the price at which any natural or regulated product is purchased and the price at which it is sold; (iv) the difference between the price at which any natural or regulated product is purchased and the sale price of the product resulting from the adaptation for sale, processing or conversion of the aforesaid natural or regulated product.\u201d Section 22 provides as follows: \u201c22. Every person who, to the detriment or against the interest of the public, charges, receives or attempts to receive any spread which is excessive or results in undue enhancement of prices or otherwise restrains or injures trade or commerce in the natural or regulated product, shall be guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars or to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or, if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.\u201d Sections 23 and 24 provide for prosecutions in a manner similar to that provided for in the Combines Investigation Act.\n*The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014Counsel on behalf of the Dominion based his argument in support of the validity of this statute upon two grounds. It is argued, first, that it is competent legislation under the general authority \u201cto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada\u201d; and, second, it is competent legislation in relation to matters coming within the second of the enumerated heads of section 91\u2014\u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d It will be convenient to discuss first the last mentioned ground.\nIn substance, we are concerned with sections, 3, 4 and 5 of the statute.\nBy section 3, the Governor General is empowered to\nestablish a Board to be known as the Dominion Marketing Board to regulate the marketing of natural products as hereinafter provided.\nBy section 4 (1) the Board is invested with power\n(a) to regulate the time and place at which, and to designate the agency through which the regulated product shall be marketed, to determine the manner of distribution, the quantity and quality, grade or class of the regulated product that shall be marketed by any person at any time, and to prohibit the marketing of any of the regulated product of any grade, quality or class;\n\u201cMarketed\u201d is used in an extended sense as embracing \u201cbuying and selling, shipping for sale or storage and offering for sale.\u201d\nThe Board is also empowered,\n(c) to conduct a pool for the equalization of returns received from the sale of the regulated product; * * *\n(\u0192) to require any or all persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product to register their names, addresses and occupations with the Board, or to obtain a licence from the Board, and such licence shall be subject to cancellation by the Board for violation of any provision of this Act or regulation made thereunder;\nSection 5 contains provisions for marketing schemes under which the marketing of a natural product, to which the scheme applies, is regulated by a local board under the supervision of the Dominion Board.\nFor the purposes of the discussion, it will not be necessary further to particularize the enactments of the statute. These enactments, in our opinion, are not enactments within the contemplation of the second head of section 91, \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce\u201d in the sense which has been ascribed to those words by decisions which are binding upon us and which it is our duty to follow.\nIt was argued by Mr. Rowell that two recent decisions, Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada[1] and the Aeronautics Reference[2] manifest a departure by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from the principles governing the application of the residuary clause, as well as of this particular enactment which is also couched in very sweeping terms. In view of the argument addressed to us, and, in view of the character of the enactments under consideration, passed as recently as July, 1934, it would appear to be desirable, if not, indeed necessary, to review afresh the decisions and the grounds of the decisions by which this Court has hitherto supposed itself to be governed in the interpretation and application of head no. 2.\nThe judgment of the Board in Parsons case[3] contains the well known elucidation of the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d which received the express approval of the Judicial Committee in Wharton\u2019s case[4]. The later cases, in which the Board had to consider the scope of the sphere of jurisdiction designated by head no. 2 are the Montreal Street Railway case[5]; A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for Alberta[6]; the Board of Commerce case[7]; A.G. for B.C. v. A.G. for Canada[8]; Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[9].\nThe discussion in Parsons case[10] has been many times considered and sometimes criticized. It is, we think, worth while to quote it in full (p. 112):\nThe words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce,\u201d in their unlimited sense are sufficiently wide if uncontrolled by the context and other parts of the Act, to include every regulation of trade ranging from political arrangements in regard to trade with foreign governments, requiring the sanction of parliament, down to minute rules for regulating particular trades. But a consideration of the Act shews that the words were not used in this unlimited sense. In the first place, the collocation of No. 2 with classes of subjects of national and general concern affords an indication that regulations relating to general trade and commerce were in the mind of the legislature, when conferring this power on the Dominion parliament. If the words had been intended to have the full scope of which in their literal meaning they are susceptible, the specific mention of several of the other classes of subjects enumerated in section 91 would have been unnecessary; as 15, banking; 17, weights and measures; 18, bills of exchange and promissory notes; 19, interest; and even 21, bankruptcy and insolvency. \u201cRegulation of trade and commerce\u201d may have been used in some such sense as the words \u201cregulations of trade\u201d in the Act of Union between England and Scotland (6 Anne, c. 11), and as these words have been used in Acts of State relating to trade and commerce. Article V of the Act of Union enacted that all the subjects of the United Kingdom should have \u201cfull freedom and intercourse of trade and navigation\u201d to and from all places in the United Kingdom and the Colonies; and Article VI enacted that all parts of the United Kingdom from and after the union should be under the same \u201cprohibitions, restrictions, and regulations of trade\u201d Parliament has at various times since the Union passed laws affecting and regulating specific trades in one part of the United Kingdom only, without its being supposed that it thereby infringed the Articles of Union. Thus the Acts for regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors notoriously vary in the two kingdoms. So with regard to Acts relating to bankruptcy, and various other matters.\nConstruing, therefore, the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d by the various aids to their interpretation above suggested, they would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, regulation of trade in matters of interprovincial concern, and it may be that they would include general regulations of trade affecting the whole Dominion. Their Lordships abstain on the present occasion from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the Dominion parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the present case to say that, in their view, its authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade, such as the business of fire insurance in a single province, and therefore that its legislative authority does not in the present case conflict or compete with the power over property and civil rights assigned to the legislature of Ontario by No. 13 of section 92.\nHaving taken this view of the present case, it becomes unnecessary to consider the question how far the general power to make regulations of trade and commerce, when competently exercised by the Dominion parliament, might legally modify or affect property and civil rights in the provinces, or the legislative power of the provincial legislatures in relation to those subjects;\nThe actual decision, it will be observed was that the authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not contemplate the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade in a single province. But the judgment suggests, although it does not decide, that this power of regulation does not extend to the unlimited regulation of particular trades and occupations. On the other hand, there is nothing in the judgment to indicate that the regulation of external trade is excluded from the scope of the authority, nor is there anything to suggest, whatever the precise scope of the power may be, that, when Parliament is legislating with reference to matters strictly within the regulation of trade and commerce, it is disabled from legislating in regard to matters otherwise exclusively within the provincial authority if such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of its exclusive powers in relation to that subject.\nThe subject was further elucidated by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for Alberta[11]. There it was held that this authority does not extend to regulation by a licensing system of \u201ca particular trade in which Canadians would otherwise be free to engage in the provinces.\u201d Here again there is no suggestion that trade in a particular commodity, in so far as it is external trade or interprovincial trade, is not within the exclusive regulative authority of the Dominion.\nIt is convenient at this point to revert to the discussion of the subject which occurred in the Montreal Street Railway case[12]. The judgment of the Board was written by Lord Atkinson, and the Board included Lord Loreburn and Lord MacNaghten. The controversy concerned the validity of an order made by the Board of Railway Commissioners under the authority of a provision of the Dominion Railways Act which required the owners of the Montreal Street Railway, a local work within the meaning of the 10th heading of section 92, and normally subject, exclusively to the control of the provincial legislature, to enter into an agreement with the owners of the Montreal Park and Island Railway which was a railway subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and which connected with the street railway, in relation to the rates to be charged by the proprietors of the street railway in respect of through traffic passing over the street railway and the Park and Island Railway.\nAdmittedly, the legislature of Quebec had no authority to legislate in relation to such a matter as regards the Dominion undertaking, and on various grounds it was contended that the Dominion Parliament necessarily possessed authority to legislate in relation to through traffic and for the provincial railway in respect of such traffic. This authority was said to be bestowed by, inter alia, the residuary clause and by head no. 2 of section 91, \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d It was necessary for the determination of the appeal that their Lordships should pronounce upon both these contentions. They were examined in a single passage which we now quote. From the judgment in A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada[13] their Lordships adduced the following principles as applicable to the case before them:\n(1) that the exception contained in s. 91, near its end, was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by the 16th subsection of s. 92, save to the extent \u00f3f enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters, local or private, in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the power conferred upon that Parliament under the heads enumerated in s. 91; (2) that to those matters which are not specified amongst the enumerated subjects of legislation in s. 91 the exception at its end has no application, and that in legislating with respect to matters not so enumerated the Dominion Parliament has no authority to encroach upon any class of subjects which is exclusively assigned to the provincial Legislature by s. 92; (3) that these enactments, ss. 91 and 92, indicate that the exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91 ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92; (4) that to attach any other construction to the general powers which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, are conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 would not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces; and, lastly, that if the Parliament of Canada had authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject upon which it might not legislate to the exclusion of provincial legislation. (1912, A.C. at p. 343).\nTheir Lordships then proceeded,\nThe same considerations appear to their Lordships to apply to two of the matters enumerated in s. 91, namely, the regulation of trade and commerce. Taken in their widest sense these words would authorize legislation by the Parliament of Canada in respect of several of the matters specifically enumerated in s. 92, and would seriously encroach upon the local autonomy of the province. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion these pronouncements have an important bearing on the question for decision in the present case, though the case itself in which they were made was wholly different from the present case, and the decision given in it has little if any application to the present case. They apparently established this, that the invasion of the rights of the province which the Railway Act and the Order of the Commissioners necessarily involve in respect of one of the matters enumerated in s. 92, namely, legislation touching local railways, cannot be justified on the ground that this Act and Order concern the peace, order and good government of Canada nor upon the ground that they deal with the regulation of trade and commerce.\nThe general expressions in this passage must, of course, be read in the light of the controversy with which their Lordships were dealing. They were, as we have seen, discussing the question raised as to the authority of the Dominion in exercise of its powers in regard to regulation of trade and commerce to legislate for a local work or undertaking of the character assigned, prima facie, exclusively to the jurisdiction of the province by section 92 (10). But the passage, as was pointed out in this court in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit & Vegetable Committee[14], signalizes the distinction between that which is national in its scope and concern and that which in each of the provinces is of private or local, that is to say, of provincial interest, which must be observed in deciding whether a particular enactment falls within the Dominion authority respecting the regulation of trade and commerce.\nIn A.G. for B.C. v. A.G. for Canada[15], the Board dealt with the subject of the regulation of external trade. The question before the Board in that case concerned the authority of the Dominion of Canada to impose customs duties upon alcoholic liquors imported into Canada by the Government of British Columbia for the purpose of sale by that government. It was pointed out in the judgment delivered by Lord Buckmaster; that the imposition of customs duties may have for its object regulation of trade and commerce, or it may have the twofold purpose of regulating trade and commerce and raising money; and it was held that section 125 of the B.N.A. Act, which prohibits the taxation of the property of the Crown, ought not to be so construed and applied as to interfere with the authority of the Parliament of Canada to regulate trade and commerce and to impose customs duties for that purpose.\nThis decision seems very plainly to involve the proposition that, by an enactment of the Parliament of Canada, trade in a particular commodity or class of commodities may be subjected to regulation through the instrumentality of customs duties.\nThere is another decision the mention of which ought not to be omitted, viz., the decision of 1885 of the Judicial Committee on the reference concerning the validity of the Dominion Liquor Licence Acts where their Lordships held that a system for the local licensing of the liquor trade was beyond the competence of the Dominion Parliament to establish.\nIt would appear to result from these decisions that the regulation of trade and commerce does not comprise, in the sense in which it is used in section 91, the regulation of particular trades or occupations or of a particular kind of business such as the insurance business in the provinces, or the regulation of trade in particular commodities or classes of commodities in so far as it is local in the provincial sense; while, on the other hand, it does embrace the regulation of external trade and the regulation of inter-provincial trade and such ancillary legislation as may be necessarily incidental to the exercise of such powers.\nThere is another class of regulation which has been held to fall within the purview of head no. 2 (John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[16]: regulation which is auxiliary to some Dominion measure dealing with matters not falling within section 92, such, for example, as the incorporation of Dominion companies.\nObviously, these propositions do not furnish a complete definition of the authority given by the second subdivision of section 91. Logically, they leave scope for a possible jurisdiction in relation to \u201cgeneral trade and commerce\u201d or in relation to \u201cgeneral regulations of trade applicable to the whole Dominion\u201d\u2014phrases employed in the judgment in Parson\u2019s case. Broadly speaking, they have their basis in the consideration mentioned in Parsons case[17] arising from the specification of particular subjects in section 91 and from the necessity to limit the natural scope of the words,\nin order to preserve from serious curtailment, if not from virtual extinction, the degree of autonomy, which as appears from the scheme of the Act as a whole, the provinces were intended to enjoy. (Lawson\u2019s case[18]).\nRestrictions upon the natural meaning of the words, in so far as they are dictated by force of such considerations, may properly be accepted as the necessary result of the application of settled principles of construction pursuant to which, from the beginning, it has been recognized that, in considering sections 91 and 92, the language of each must be read in light of the other and in some cases even modified for the purpose of giving effect to the two sections. The necessity for some such restriction seems to be demonstrable by reference to the concluding clause of s. 91 which is in these words:\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nIn A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada[19] it was held that the language of this exception was meant to include all matters enumerated within the sixteen heads of s. 92; and in A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for Ontario[20] it was laid down and decided that section 91 contains a legislative declaration that legislation upon any matter falling strictly within any of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 is not within the competence, as matter of legislation, of a provincial legislature under s. 92.\nWhenever * * * a matter is within one of these specified classes, their Lordships said, legislation in relation to it by a Provincial Legislature is in their Lordships\u2019 opinion incompetent.\nThe decision in Hodge v. The Queen[21] that it is competent to a province to regulate by a local licensing system the trade in liquor seems incompatible with the contention that such local regulation of the trade in particular commodities is strictly within any of the classes of matters comprehended under the general words \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce\u201d; and this was the view taken by the Board in the case of A.G. for Alberta v. A.G. for Canada[22]. Such was also, it would appear, the necessary effect of the judgment of the Board on the Reference in 1885 in relation to the Dominion Licensing Acts which has already been mentioned.\nIt does not seem to admit of serious dispute that, if, regards natural products, as defined by the Act, the provinces are destitute of the powers to regulate the dealing with natural products in respect of the matters designated in section 4 (1), a, the powers of the provinces are much more limited than they have generally been supposed to be. If this defect of power exists in relation to natural products it exists in relation to anything that may be the subject of trade. Furthermore, if the Dominion has power to enact section 4 (1) f, as a provision falling strictly within \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d then the provinces are destitute of the power to regulate, by licensing persons engaged in the production, the buying and selling, the shipping for sale or storage and the offering for sale, in an exclusively local and provincial way of business of any commodity or commodities. The acceptance of this view of the powers of the provinces would seem to be inconsistent, not only with Hodge v. The Queen[23], but with the judgment in the Montreal Street Railway case[24] as well as with the judgment in the Board of Commerce case[25]. The judgment in this latter case seems very plainly to declare that in the absence of very special circumstances such as those indicated in the judgment of the Board, such matters as subjects of legislation fall within the jurisdiction of the provinces under section 92.\nThe enactments in question, therefore, in so far as they relate to matters which are in substance local and provincial are beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament. Parliament cannot acquire jurisdiction to deal in the sweeping way in which these enactments operate with such local and provincial matters by legislating at the same time respecting external and interprovincial trade and committing the regulation of external and interprovincial trade and the regulation of trade which is exclusively local and of traders and producers engaged in trade which is exclusively local to the same authority (King v. Eastern Terminal Elevators[26]).\nIt should also be observed that these enactments operate by way of the regulation of dealings in particular commodities and classes of commodities. The regulations contemplated are not general regulations of trade as a whole or regulations of general trade and commerce within the sense of the judgment in Parson\u2019s case.\nWe come now to the judgments in the Board of Commerce case and Snider\u2019s case27.\nIn Snider\u2019s case[27], the view of the Board is stated in the following passage: Nor does the invocation of the specific power in s. 91 to regulate trade and commerce assist the Dominion contention. In Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[28], it was laid down that the collocation of this head (No. 2 of s. 91), with classes of subjects enumerated of national and general concern, indicates that what was in the mind of the Imperial Legislature when this power was conferred in 1867 was regulation relating to general trade and commerce. Any other construction would, it was pointed out, have rendered unnecessary the specific mention of certain other heads dealing with banking, bills of exchange and promissory notes, as to which it had been significantly deemed necessary to insert a specific mention. The contracts of a particular trade or business could not, therefore, be dealt with by Dominion legislation so as to conflict with the powers assigned to the Provinces over property and civil rights relating to the regulation of trade and commerce. The Dominion power has a really definite effect when applied in aid of what the Dominion Government are specifically enabled to do independently of the general regulation of trade and commerce, for instance, in the creation of Dominion companies with power to trade throughout the whole of Canada. This was shown in the decision in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[29]. The same thing is true of the exercise of an emergency power required, as on the occasion of war, in the interest of Canada as a whole, a power which may operate outside the specific enumerations in both ss. 91 and 92. And it was observed in A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for Alberta[30], in reference to attempted Dominion legislation about insurance, that it must now be taken that the authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not extend to the regulation, for instance, by a licensing system, of a particular trade in which Canadians would otherwise be free to engage in the provinces. It is, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, now clear that, excepting so far as the power can be invoked in aid of capacity conferred independently under other words in s. 91, the power to regulate trade and commerce cannot be relied on as enabling the Dominion Parliament to regulate civil rights in the provinces.\nIt is quite obvious that their Lordships are here not dealing with the regulation of external trade or the regulation of trade in matters of interprovincial concern. For our present purpose, it seems sufficient to say that their Lordships deemed it necessary or expedient for the purpose of dealing with an argument addressed to them to discuss the scope of the power conferred by head no. 2 of section 91; and that, on any conceivable construction of the words, it would appear to be impossible consistently with them to support the authority of the statute under consideration.\nAs to the decision on the Aeronautics Reference[31] and the Radio Reference[32], it does not seem necessary to enter upon a minute analysis of the judgments in those cases. The decision on the Radio Reference32 proceeded on two grounds: first, for the reasons fully explained in the judgment, the legislation in question (being legislation for giving effect to an international obligation binding upon Canada) was within the ambit of the powers conferred by the residuary clause; and, second, that instruments employed in radio transmission fall within the class of undertakings which, by the combined operation of head no. 10 of section 92 and head no. 29 of section 91, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of Canada. In the last mentioned judgment it was pointed out that the decisions in the Aeronautics Reference[33] proceeded mainly upon the application of section 132. The subject-matters of the enactments and regulations actually or hypothetically considered in those two cases have no sort of resemblance to the subject matter of this legislation.\nThere is nothing in either of these judgments to justify an inference that their Lordships intended to overrule the long series of their own decisions hereinbefore mentioned; or the reasons upon which those decisions were founded.\nThere is one further observation which, perhaps, ought not to be omitted although it may be a mere corollary of what has already been said. Legislation necessarily incidental to the exercise of the undoubted powers of the Dominion in respect of the regulations of trade and commerce is competent although such legislation may trench upon subjects reserved to the provinces by section 92, but it cannot, we think, be seriously contended that sweeping regulation in respect of local trade, such as we find in this enactment, is, in the proper sense, necessarily incidental to the regulation of external trade or interprovincial trade or both combined.\nThe scheme of this statute in respect of its essential enactments would not appear to be practicable as a legislative scheme.\nin view of the distribution of legislative powers enacted by the Constitution Act, without the co-operation of the provincial legislatures\nto quote from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Re the Board of Commerce Act[34].\nTurning now to the contention that this statute is a valid exercise of the power of Parliament under the introductory clause of section 91, there is a preliminary observation to be made. This argument has been pressed upon us in support of six of the statutes which have been referred to us for consideration. These are the statutes relating to the Minimum Wages, to Limitation of Hours of Work, to a Weekly Rest Day; to Employment and Social Insurance; to Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangements and to the statute immediately under consideration, the Natural Products Marketing Act. The discussion which follows was written with special reference to the first three of these statutes; the argument upon the reference relating to them being that, apart altogether from the circumstance that the subject matters of the enactments are subjects of international agreements in respect of which international obligations have been assumed, they are dealt with in aspects which do not fall under section 92 and can only be the subject matter of legislation under the initial clause of section 91. What follows, however, in substance pertains to the argument as presented in support of all the statutes mentioned and it has been thought convenient to produce it in this place.\nIt is important not to lose sight of the language of the statute itself. The initial words of section 91 empower\nthe Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nBy section 92,\nin each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects\nenumerated. These classes of subjects include (No. 13)\nProperty and Civil Rights in the Province.\nBy section 94,\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act, the Parliament of Canada may make provision for the uniformity of all or any of the laws relative to property and civil rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and of the procedure of all or any of the courts in those three provinces, and from and after the passing of any Act in that behalf the power of the Parliament of Canada to make laws in relation to any matter comprised in any such Act shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act, be unrestricted; but any Act of the Parliament of Canada making provision for such uniformity shall not have effect in any province unless and until it is adopted and enacted as law by the legislature thereof.\nSection 94, it will be observed, has no application to Quebec.\nLanguage could not be more plain or, indeed, more explicit to declare that the subjects, Property and Civil Rights, are not subjects assigned to the Parliament of Canada under the initial words of section 91.\nWe are not concerned with the enumerated subjects assigned to Parliament under the second limb of that section; or with the concluding paragraph of the section which, as the Courts have recognized, has obviously no application to the first limb of the section, which alone is now pertinent.\nIt is settled by the decisions of the Judicial Committee that the phrase \u201cProperty and Civil Rights\u201d is used in the \u201clargest sense,\u201d subject, of course, to the limitations arising expressly from the exception of the enumerated heads of section 91, and impliedly from the specification of subjects in section 92.\nIt is to be observed, said the Board in Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[35], that the same words, \u201ccivil rights,\u201d are employed in the Act of 14 Geo. 3, c. 83, which made provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec. Section 8 of that Act enacted that His Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects within the province of Quebec should enjoy their property, usages, and other civil rights, as they had before done, and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort should be had to the laws of Canada, and be determined agreeably to the said laws. In this statute the words \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201ccivil rights\u201d are plainly used in their largest sense; and there is no reason for holding that in the statute under discussion they are used in a different and narrower one.\nThe legislation admittedly affects civil rights and interferes with, and controls, and regulates the exercise in every one of the provinces of the civil rights of the people in those provinces; but it is said that the real subject matter of the legislation is not these civil rights, which are controlled and regulated, but something else.\nThe initial clause of section 91 has been many times considered. There is no dispute now that the exception which excludes from the ambit of the general power all matters assigned to the exclusive authority of the legislatures must be given its full effect. Nevertheless, it has been laid down that matters normally comprised within the subjects enumerated in section 92 may, in extraordinary circumstances, acquire aspects of such paramount significance as to take them outside the sphere of that section.\nThe argument is mainly supported by two sentences in the judgment of the Board in A.G for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada[36]. The judgment of the Board in that case was directed to the answers to be given to certain questions submitted by the Governor General in Council to this Court, all of which questions immediately concerned the jurisdiction of a provincial legislature in respect of the prohibition of certain phases of the liquor traffic. The two sentences occur in the discussion of the seventh question which relate to the jurisdiction of the Ontario Legislature to enact a section of a statute of that Province entitled \u201cAn Act respecting local option in the matter of liquor selling.\u201d In the course of that discussion, their Lordships dealt with the general authority given to the Parliament of Canada under the first of the introductory enactments of section 91 which is quoted above, and their Lordships observed,\n* * * to those matters which are not specified among the enumerated subjects of legislation, the exception from s. 92, which is enacted by the concluding words of s. 91, has no application; and, in legislating with regard to such matters, the Dominion Parliament has no authority to encroach upon any class of subjects which is exclusively assigned to provincial legislatures by s. 92. These enactments appear to their Lordships to indicate that the exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada, in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91, ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92. To attach any other construction to the general power which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, is conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91, would, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces. If it were once conceded that the Parliament of Canada has authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion, in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject enumerated in s. 92 upon which it might not legislate, to the exclusion of the provincial legislatures.\nTheir Lordships proceeded, in the two sentences which are now mainly relied upon,\nTheir Lordships do not doubt that some matters, in their origin local and provincial, might attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition in the interest of the Dominion. But great caution must be observed in distinguishing between that which is local and provincial, and therefore within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, and that which has ceased to be merely local or provincial, and has become matter of national concern, in such sense as to bring it within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt seems to us right, if these two sentences are to be properly understood, that they should be read with the preceding sentences; and experience seems to shew that there has been a disposition not to attend to the limits implied in the carefully guarded language in which the Board expressed itself. It has been assumed, apparently, that they lay down a rule of construction the effect of which is that all matters comprised in any one of the enumerated subdivisions of section 92 may attain \u201csuch dimensions as to \u2026 cease to be merely local or provincial\u201d and become in some other aspect of them matters relating to the \u201cpeace, order and good government of Canada\u201d and subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament, of Canada.\nThe difficulty of applying such a rule to matters falling, within the first subdivision, for example, of section 92, which relates to the amendment of the provincial constitutions \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act,\u201d must be very great. On the face of the language of the statute, the authority seems to be intended to be absolute. In other words, it seems to be very clearly stated that matters comprised within the subject matter of the constitution of the province \u201cexcept as regards the office of Lieutenant-Governor\u201d are matters local and provincial, and that they are not matters which can be comprised in any of the classes of subjects of section 91.\nThen the decision in the Montreal Park & Island Railway v. City of Montreal[37] seems to be final upon the point that local works and undertakings, subject to the exceptions contained in subdivision no. 10 of section 92 and matters comprised within that description, are matters local and provincial within the meaning of section 92 and excepted from the general authority given by the introductory enactment of section 91.\nThe same might be said of the solemnization of marriage in the province. Marriage and divorce are given without qualification to the Dominion under subdivision 26 of section 91, but the effect of section 92 (12), it has been held, is to exclude from the Dominion jurisdiction in relation to marriage and divorce the subject of solemnization of marriage in the province. It is very difficult to conceive the possibility of solemnization of marriage, in the face of this plain declaration by the legislature, assuming aspects which would bring it within the general authority of the Dominion in relation to peace, order and good government, in such fashion, for example, as to enable the Dominion to prohibit or to deprive of legal effect a religious ceremony of marriage. The like might be said of no. 2, Taxation within the Province; the Borrowing of Monies on the Sole Credit of the Province; Municipal Institutions in the Province; and the Administration of Justice, including the constitution of the Courts and Procedure in Civil Matters in the Courts.\nIn the Manitoba Licence Holders case[38], Lord Macnaghten, speaking for a Board which included Lord Hob-house, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson and Lord Lindley, said that, in their Lordships\u2019 view, it was doubtful if the Canada Temperance Act could be sustained as valid legislation by the Dominion on the assumption that the matter of statute was comprised within section 13.\n* * * a careful perusal of the judgment (in A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for the Dominion[39]), leads to the conclusion that, in the opinion of the Board, the case fell under No. 16 rather than under No. 13. And that seems to their Lordships to be the better opinion[40].\nThe judgment proceeds:\u2014\nIndeed, if the case is to be regarded as dealing with matters within the class of subjects enumerated in No. 13, it might be questionable whether the Dominion Legislature could have authority to interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of the province in the matter.\nLord Davey, who took part in this judgment, was a member of the Board which pronounced the judgment containing the two sentences under discussion.\nAs we have said, Lord Watson\u2019s language is carefully guarded. He does not say that every matter which attains such dimensions as to effect the body politic of the Dominion falls thereby within the introductory matter of section 91. But he said that \u201csome matters\u201d may attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion and, as we think the sentence ought to be read having regard to the context, in such manner and degree as may \u201cjustify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition. \u2026\u201d So, in the second sentence, he is not dealing with all matters of \u201cnational concern\u201d in the broadest sense of those words, but only those which are matter of national concern \u201cin such sense\u201d as to bring them within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe application of the principle implicit in this passage must always be a delicate and difficult task. That is shewn by reference to the history of the Canada Temperance Act. The prohibitory clauses of the legislation undoubtedly do affect civil rights directly but, in Russell v. The Queen[41], the Board took the view that the real subject matter of the legislation was not property and civil rights, but matter connected with public order and having a close relation to the criminal law. It was likened to \u201claws which place restrictions on the sale or custody of poisonous drugs, or of dangerously explosive substances \u2026 on the ground that the free sale or use of them is dangerous to public safety, and making it a criminal offence \u2026 to violate these restrictions. \u2026\u201d It was described as \u201clegislation \u2026 relating to public order and safety,\u201d and belonging to the class of \u201cLaws \u2026 for the promotion of public order, safety, or morals, and which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment. \u2026\u201d\nUnfortunately, on this point, the case was unargued, Mr. Benjamin conceding that the enactments would have fallen within the general authority of the Dominion if it had been brought into force immediately throughout every part of the Dominion. The difficulty has been pointed out more than once of reconciling this decision with the subsequent decision of a very powerful Board in the Dominion Liquor Licence case, in which an Act of the Dominion Parliament regulating by licence the sale of liquor throughout the Dominion was held to be ultra vires notwithstanding the following preamble:\nWhereas it is desirable to regulate the traffic in the sale of intoxicating liquor, and it is expedient that the law respecting the same should be uniform throughout the Dominion, and that provision should be made in regard thereto for the better preservation of peace and order;\nAnd, in the judgment of Lord Watson in A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada[42] it is observed (p. 362):\nThe judgment of this Board in Russell v. Regina42 has relieved their Lordships from the difficult duty of considering whether the Canada Temperance Act of 1886 relates to the peace, order and good government of Canada, in such sense as to bring its provisions within the competency of the Canadian Parliament. Russell v. The Queen[43] has been explained in a more recent decision and we shall come to that in a moment. The point we are now concerned with is this: The question whether the prohibition and the regulation of the right to manufacture or deal in intoxicating liquors throughout the Dominion could, by reason of its analogy to legislation regulating or suppressing the sale of poisonous drugs or explosives, the manufacture and sale of poisonous drugs and explosives, and the connection between the matters dealt with and public order and the criminal law, be justified as legislation within the initial clause of section 91 is a question in respect of which the great judges who had to consider the cases we have mentioned found themselves in doubt and difficulty. Lord Watson\u2019s admonition to the courts to observe \u201cgreat caution\u201d in considering such matters is one that will not be lightly disregarded by prudent judges. The words of the passage in Lord Watson\u2019s judgment in themselves are not intended, obviously, to provide a test for determining in any given case whether a matter falling within \u201cProperty and Civil Rights\u201d in the province has acquired such aspects as to take it out of the classes of subjects dealt with in section 92. The interpretation of Lord Watson\u2019s language in this sense by the judgment of the Board in Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[44] is, if we may say so, fully justified by that judgment when read as a whole. We may add that Lord Macnaghten, who wrote the judgment in the Manitoba Licence Holders case[45], was also a member of the Board who decided the Montreal case44. In performing the very difficult task of deciding upon such questions, the courts must have regard to the provisions of the B.N.A. Act as a whole and to the practical application of the introductory enactment of section 91 in the decisions of the courts. In considering these decisions, it is important to read what is said in the light of the thing that was decided; and it is fundamental that the interpretation and application of sections 91 and 92 of the B.N.A. Act cannot be controlled by particular expressions used in a judgment torn from their context and given the broadest meaning of which the words are capable without any reference to that context or to the particular controversy to which the language was directed.\nThe necessity for Lord Watson\u2019s admonition becomes more clear when we recall that there is only one case in which the Judicial Committee has held that legislation with regard to matters which were admittedly ex facie civil rights within a province, had by reason of exceptional circumstances acquired aspects and relations bringing them within the ambit of the introductory clause. That case is Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Press[46].\nBefore dealing with the Fort Frances case46, it will be necessary to refer to two other decisions, in the Board of Commerce Act case[47] and in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[48].\nIn the Board of Commerce case the Judicial Committee had to consider legislation by which a Dominion Board was constituted and empowered, broadly speaking, to inquire into, and prohibit, profiteering and practices in connection therewith in dealings in the necessaries of life. In particular, the Board had authority to regulate the prices of such necessaries of life.\nThe question arose upon a case stated as to the validity of an order made by the Board regulating the prices of ready made clothing in certain establishments in Ottawa. The validity of the order was attacked by the associations of manufacturers concerned and was supported by counsel on behalf of the Board and of the Dominion. The litigation raised the concrete question inter partes as to the legality of the particular order; and the answer to that question turned upon the answer to the question concerning the validity of the legislation, which it was, therefore, essential to determine. The statute was supported on various grounds and, among others, on the ground that in the year 1919, when it was enacted, the evils of hoarding and high prices in respect of the necessaries of life had attained such dimensions \u201cas to affect the body politic of Canada.\u201d Nobody denied the existence of the evil. Nobody denied that it was general throughout Canada. Nobody denied the importance of suppressing it. Nobody denied that it prejudiced and seriously prejudiced the well being of the people of Canada as a whole, or that in a loose, popular sense of the words it \u201caffected the body politic of Canada.\u201d Nevertheless, it was held that these facts did not constitute a sufficient basis for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Dominion Parliament under the introductory clause in the manner attempted. The Board said that in special circumstances, such as those of a great war, the interest of the Dominion in the matters might conceivably become of such paramount and overriding importance as to lie outside the heads of section 92 and not be covered by them. But it is, they held, quite another matter to say that under normal circumstances, general Canadian policy can justify interference, on the scale of the statutes than in controversy, with the property and civil rights of the inhabitants of the provinces.\nIt has already been observed that circumstances are conceivable, such as those of war or famine, when the peace, order and good government of the Dominion might be imperilled under conditions so exceptional that they require legislation of a character in reality beyond anything provided for by the enumerated heads in either s. 92 or s. 91 itself. Such a case, if it were to arise, would have to be considered closely before the conclusion would properly be reached that it was one which could not be treated as falling under any of the heads enumerated. Still, it is a conceivable case, and although great caution is required in referring to it, even in general terms, it ought not, in the view their Lordships take of the British North America Act, read as a whole, to be excluded from what is possible. For throughout the provisions of that Act there is apparent the recognition that subjects which would normally belong exclusively to a specifically assigned class of subject may, under different circumstances and in another aspect, assume a further significance. Such an aspect may conceivably become of paramount importance, and of dimensions that give rise to other aspects. This is a principle which, although recognized in earlier decisions, such as that of Russell v. The Queen[49], both here and in the Courts of Canada, has always been applied with reluctance, and its recognition as relevant can be justified only after scrutiny sufficient to render it clear that the circumstances are abnormal. In the case before them, however important it may seem to the Parliament of Canada that some such policy as that adopted in the two Acts in question should be made general throughout Canada, their Lordships do not find any evidence that the standard of necessity referred to has been reached, or that the attainment of the end sought is practicable, in view of the distribution of legislative powers enacted by the Constitution Act, without the co-operation of the Provincial Legislatures[50].\nThe reluctance of the Courts to give effect to such arguments as that now under consideration is illustrated also in Snider\u2019s case[51]. The legislation in question there was framed for the purpose of dealing with industrial disputes and authorized the Minister of Labour to take steps to convene, in the case of such a dispute, a Board composed of a representative of the workmen, a representative of the employer, and a third person to be nominated by the Minister of Labour himself. The Act prohibited a strike or lockout pending the consideration of a dispute by the Board. The importance of the matters dealt with by the statute, the fact that the statute was making a provision for meeting a condition which prevailed throughout the whole of Canada and for dealing with industrial disputes which, in many and, indeed, most cases, would affect people in more than one province, the fact that the machinery provided had proved to be a valuable instrument in the interests of industrial peace, were not disputed. Nevertheless, the Board negatived the existence of\nthe general principle that the mere fact that Dominion legislation is for the general advantage of Canada, or is such that it will meet a mere want which is felt throughout the Dominion, renders it competent if it cannot be brought within the heads enumerated specifically in section 91.\nThe judgment of the Board proceeds:\u2014\nNo doubt there may be cases arising out of some extraordinary peril to the national life of Canada, as a whole, such as the cases arising out of a war, where legislation is required of an order that passes beyond the heads of exclusive Provincial competency. Such cases may be dealt with under the words at the commencement of s. 91, conferring general powers in relation to peace, order and good government simply because such cases are not otherwise provided for. But instances of this, as was pointed out in the judgment in Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press[52] are highly exceptional. Their Lordships think that the decision in Russell v. The Queen[53] can only be supported to-day, not on the footing of having laid down an interpretation, such as has sometimes been invoked in the general words at the beginning of s. 91, but on the assumption of the Board, apparently made at the time of deciding the case of Russell v. The Queen53, that the evil of intemperance at that time amounted in Canada to one so great and so general that at least for the period it was a menace to the national life of Canada so serious and pressing that the National Parliament was called on to intervene to protect the nation from disaster. An epidemic of pestilence might conceivably have been regarded an analogous. It is plain from the decision in the Board of Commerce case[54] that the evil of profiteering could not have been so invoked, for Provincial Powers, if exercised, were adequate to it. Their Lordships find it difficult to explain the decision in Russell v. The Queen[55] as more than a decision of this order upon facts, considered to have been established at its date rather than upon general law.\nThe principle enunciated in this last paragraph had been applied in the Fort Frances case52, the authority of which seems to be recognized in the judgment in the Aeronautics Reference[56].\nOn behalf of the Dominion it is argued that the judgment in the Aeronautics case[57] constitutes a new point of departure. The effect of that judgment, it seems to be argued, is that if, in the broadest sense of the words, the matters dealt with are matters \u201cof national concern\u201d matters which \u201caffect the body politic of the Dominion,\u201d jurisdiction arises under the introductory clause. One sentence is quoted from the judgment in the Aeronautics case57 which we will not reproduce because we do not think their Lordships can have intended in that sentence to promulgate a canon of construction for sections 91 and 92. We see nothing in the judgment in the Aeronautics case57 to indicate that their Lordships intended to detract from the judicial authority of the decisions in the Combines case[58] and Snider\u2019s case[59].\nIn the Aeronautics case57, it is true, their Lordships called attention to the circumstance that, by section 132, the Dominion possesses powers to legislate in relation to matters which, in the domestic sense, would fall within section 92 when these matters have become affected by an international obligation by which Canada is bound; and in the subsequent case, reported in the same volume of the Appeal Cases, the Radio Reference[60], it was held that matters affected by an obligation arising under an international arrangement, not falling within section 132, but constituted in virtue of powers acquired in course of the recent constitutional developments, would fall within the general authority of section 91 because such international obligations were not comprehended within any of the specific subjects enumerated within section 91 or section 92; and in the Aeronautics case57, as already observed, the authority of the decision in the Fort Frances case[61] is expressly recognized. The judgments in the Combines case58, the Fort Frances case61, Snider\u2019s case59, obviously have no reference to legislation dealing with matters of civil right from the international point of view. We are bound, in our view, by the decisions in the Combines case[62] and in Snider\u2019s case[63] as well as by the decision in the Fort Frances case[64], and, consistently with those decisions, we do not see how it is possible that the argument now under discussion can receive effect.\nTo summarize: in effect, this statute attempts and, indeed, professes, to regulate in the provinces of Canada, by the instrumentality of a commission or commissions appointed under the authority of the statute, trade in individual commodities and classes of commodities. The powers of regulation vested in the commissions extend to external trade and matters connected therewith and to trade in matters of interprovincial concern; but also to trade which is entirely local and of purely local concern.\nRegulation of individual trades, or trades in individual commodities in this sweeping fashion, is not competent to the Parliament of Canada and such a scheme of regulation is not practicable\nin view of the distribution of legislative powers enacted by the Constitution Act, without the co-operation of the provincial legislatures\nto quote from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Board of Commerce case[65].\nThe legislation, for the reasons given, is not valid as an exercise of the general authority of the Parliament of Canada under the introductory words of section 91 to make laws \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada.\u201d\n* Reporter\u2019s note: Counsel on the argument of this Reference were the same as those mentioned at p. 365.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 310.\n[2] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[3] (1881) 7 A.C. 96, at 112 et seq.\n[4] [1915] A.C. 340\n[5] [1912] A.C. 333.\n[6] [1916] 1 A.C. 588.\n[7] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[8] [1924] A.C. 222.\n[9] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[10] (1881) 7 A.C. 96.\n[11] [1916] 1 A.C. 588.\n[12] [1912] A.C. 333.\n[13] [1896] A.C. 491.\n[14] [1931] S.C.R. 357, at 367.\n[15] (1924) A.C. 222.\n[16] [1915] A.C. 330.\n[17] (1881) 7 A.C. 96.\n[18] [1931] S.C.R. 357 at 366.\n[19] (1896) A.C. 359.\n[20] (1898) A.C. 700, at 715.\n[21] (1883) 9 A.C. 117.\n[22] [1928] A.C. 475.\n[23] (1883) 9 A.C. 117.\n[24] [1912] A.C. 33.\n[25] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[26] [1925] S.C.R. 434.\n27 [1925] A.C. 396.\n[27] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[28] (1881) 7 A.C. 96, at 112.\n[29] [1915] A.C. 330, at 340.\n[30] [1916] 1 A.C. 588, at 596.\n[31] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[32] [1932] A.C.

The Crown alleged that the loss and damage were the consequence of the construction, in 1928, of a large power house and dam, across the river about two and a half miles upstream from the embankment, which were owned, maintained and operated by the appellant company. The Exchequer Court of Canada maintained the respondent\u2019s action for the full amount claimed, less a sum of $600.\nHeld that the appellant company was liable, as the existence of the appellant\u2019s dam led directly to the washing out of the railway embankment, but that the amount of the damages awarded by the trial judge should be reduced to $31,418.03.\nHeld, per Cannon and Crocket JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc, that, under the laws of Quebec, the appellant company could be held liable only for the damages caused by the injury to the enjoyment of the rights of the railway company as riparian owner; and thus it would not include the locomotive and rolling stock which happened to reach the site of the embankment after the washout. The statutory liability cannot be extended beyond what the law has fixed as the price of the servitude on riparian owners, i.e., the damage caused to the riparian owner, as such, of any property by the damming of the waters. Under the circumstances the failure of the railway employees to safeguard the train was a failure in an obvious duty and relieves the appellant from responsibility for all damages resulting directly or indirectly from the destruction of the dam. Consequently, the respondent was entitled to recover only the costs of repairs to tracks, $5,254.57, the costs of repairs to structure, $13,004.47, and the costs of diversion of train service and of special train service, $13,158.99, making a total sum of $31,418.03.\nPer Lamont and Davis JJ.\u2014In addition to the above-mentioned damages, a further sum of $30,235.78 should be awarded to the respondent for costs of repairs to the locomotive and the cars. The liability for damages resulting from the construction and maintenance of the works of the appellant was not confined to such damages as might reasonably have been anticipated by the appellant; when it is found that a man ought to have foreseen in a general way consequences of a certain kind it will not affect him to say that he could not foresee the precise course or the full extent of the consequence which in fact happened. If liability is once established by proof of the relation of cause and effect, then those damages that flow directly are recoverable. The appellant had lawful governmental authority to construct and maintain its works in and across the St. Francis river, but it took that authority subject to the obligation created by section 12 of the Water-Course Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 46, of becoming \u201cliable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood-gates or otherwise.\u201d While the appellant was put by the statute into the position of being able lawfully to construct, maintain and operate its works, it was under the condition subsequent that it should, notwithstanding that there was no injuria, pay, under a liability imposed by the statute, for the damnum which should from time to time prove to have been occasioned to any person therefrom; and the language of the statute embraces damages, whether they occur above or below the obstruction in the river, that result from any of such works.\nHeld that the respondent was not entitled to recover the sum of $19,592.35 for medical and hospital services to employees and passengers who were victims of the accident, for funeral and ambulance expenses, for indemnities to passengers and employees and for wages paid to disabled employees.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1934] Ex.C.R. 142) varied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ.

Pratt K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014On Easter Sunday, April 8, 1928, at about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, a passenger train of the Canadian National Railways bound for the city of Montreal from the city of Quebec was derailed near the town of Drummondville in the province of Quebec in consequence of the sudden washout of the railway embankment on the east side of the St. Francis river. The locomotive and the baggage car were thrown into the bed of the river and the second-class passenger coach fell upon the baggage car though its rear truck remained on the rails. The railway embankment was a little over 90 feet in length and about 20 feet in height. Railway men speak of this embankment as part of the bridge, but it was in fact a gravel embankment in use to carry the railway tracks to the level of the bridge proper that crossed the river. This embankment was suddenly washed out shortly before the arrival of the train at that point by a tremendous overflow of water and ice which had come down the St. Francis river. The tracks that had lain upon the embankment were left hanging over the gap caused by the washout of the embankment and the trainmen being unaware of this condition until a moment or so before reaching the place of the embankment, the calamity occurred. A woman residing in the vicinity who had been watching the movement of the water and ice in the river heard the whistle of the locomotive and realizing the danger ran along the tracks towards the approaching train and signalled the engineer to stop. The engineer immediately applied the emergency brakes and reduced the speed of his train as best he could but the distance was too short within which to bring his train to a stop and the locomotive and cars plunged into the bed of the river. The engineer was so seriously burnt in the cab of his engine that he died within the week as a direct result of the accident; two men in the baggage car were drowned; several passengers were more or less seriously injured; and the cars and the trackage were badly damaged.\nThe construction of the embankment dated back to 1887. It had been built in that year by the Drummond County Railway Company and when in 1899 the Government of Canada bought the railway and undertaking of the Drummond County Railway Company, the embankment became and remained the property of His Majesty and had been in continuous use since 1887 in connection with the railway line across the St. Francis river bridge. The embankment had been inspected regularly by the railway men and had been kept in what appears to have been a reasonably good state of repair. The railway at this point is part of what is known as the Canadian National Railway System owned by the Dominion Government and the loss and damage were attributed by those in charge of the operation of the railway to the existence of a large power house and dam constructed in 1925 across the St. Francis river about two and a half miles upstream from the embankment and owned, maintained and operated by the appellant, The Southern Canada Power Company, Limited.\nHis Majesty on information of the Attorney-General of Canada commenced proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada against the appellant to recover the loss and damages sustained by the railway. The total claim amounted to $81,523.20. His Majesty recovered judgment in the Exchequer Court of Canada for the full of the amount of the claims less only the sum of $600 being the amount of a gratuity made to the woman who had signalled the train to stop. The different items of damage in the claim may be conveniently divided for consideration into three general classes. Firstly, there is the damage involved in the destruction of the embankment and the damage to the tracks amounting in all to $18,259.04. Secondly, the cost of repairs to the locomotive and the cars and the cost of auxiliary and wrecking train service, and of the diversion of the train service. These items total $43,671.81. Thirdly, there is a class of items made up of disbursements for medical and hospital services, funeral and ambulance expenses, indemnities to passengers and employees, wages paid to the disabled conductor of the train and the $600 gratuity above referred to. These items in this class total $19,592.35. The appellant appeals to this Court from the judgment rendered against it in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe quantum of damages in respect of each of the items in the claim is admitted but liability is denied in respect of the entire claim.\nA preliminary objection was raised by the appellant at the trial and renewed before us that the Crown had no right to take these proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the contention being that the right of action was by statute vested in the Canadian National Railways Company and that that company could only sue in the ordinary courts and not in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The learned trial judge carefully reviewed the statutory law upon the subject and concluded, I think rightly, that the Crown was the owner of the railway and had never given up its right to sue for any claim it had in connection with the operation of the railway. The particular section of the railway in which the accident occurred has an interesting history as part of the old Intercolonial Railway, it having become the duty of the Government of Canada by virtue of sec. 145 of the British North America Act to provide for the commencement within six months after the Union of a railway connecting the river St. Lawrence with the city of Halifax in Nova Scotia, and for the construction of such railway without intermission and its completion with all practicable speed. It was in the fulfillment of that duty imposed upon the Government of Canada by the Act of Confederation that the undertaking of the Drumond County Railway Company was acquired in 1899, and thereafter formed part of the Intercolonial Railway. It became and has continued to be the property of His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada. The ownership has never been conveyed to the Canadian National Railways Company, but to that company the management and operation of the railway have been entrusted by statute. While a right of action was given to the railway company by sec. 33 of the Canadian National Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 172, and this action might have been taken in the name of the Canadian National Railways Company, His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada did not relinquish his right as owner to sue. That being so, there is no ground for the further objection that the action should not have been brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The learned trial judge has carefully and correctly reviewed and stated the pertinent statutory provisions and the authorities, and it is unnecessary to repeat them.\nThe real question is that of liability, and apart from considering the items in the three classes of claims in the light of the law applicable to each of these classifications taken separately, the general question of liability is very largely one of fact. The learned trial judge has very carefully reviewed the evidence in great detail and at considerable length and counsel before us readily conceded that the recital of facts was substantially accurate in all respects. It is unnecessary therefore to repeat them here except in so far as may be necessary to indicate in a general way the problem that confronts us in the consideration of this appeal.\nNothing further need be said for the moment as to the construction and state of repair of the railway embankment but some general remarks at the outset as to the construction and maintenance of the dam and power house of the appellant may be appropriate. There were in fact two dams of the appellant. One, with which we are only incidentally concerned, was situate about 1,100 feet upstream from the railway bridge. Its history goes back to 1896, when the town of Drummondville built a wooden dam at substantially the same point. In 1918 the appellant acquired the power plant of the town of Drummondville, including this old wooden dam, and erected a new dam a few inches higher than the old one and at a location approximately 50 feet below the old dam which was demolished. This dam of course constituted an obstruction in the river and no doubt had some effect upon the ordinary flow of the river in its natural state but standing alone would not, I think, have been charged with the cause of the accident. In 1925 the appellant built a large power plant and dam across the St. Francis river about two and a half miles upstream from the railway bridge at what was known as Hemmings falls. The appellant is a company incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act in 1913 with its chief place of business in the province of Quebec. Carrying on its operations in that province it became subject to the laws of that province and particularly to the Water-Course Act, R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 46, to which I shall later refer. The St. Francis river being a navigable river, it was necessary under federal legislation that the plans of the works to be undertaken in the river by the appellant should be submitted to and approved by the Minister of Public Works of Canada. While there is neither proof nor admission that such approval was obtained, it has been assumed throughout that there was such authority and no point has been made of any lack of governmental authority in connection with the construction and maintenance of the power house and the dams. The question of liability for damages that might result from the construction or maintenance of the works need not be discussed until we have a clear understanding of the facts. It is sufficient for the moment to state that under sec. 12 of the Water-Course Act,\nthe owner or lessee of any such work shall be liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood-gates or otherwise.\nThe real question, apart from any consideration of the statute, is a question of fact as to whether or not the damages claimed in the action resulted from the presence in the river of the works of the appellant.\nReverting then to the large dam at Hemmings falls, the construction of that dam raised the level of the water upstream 9\u00b72 feet and created a basin about five and a half miles in length where previously there had been one not exceeding three and a half miles. The natural width of the river within the five and a half miles of basin was inevitably widened and at some point very considerably. At one point the width became almost doubled and reached a distance of over half a mile. The dam itself was some fifty-four feet in height of solid concrete wall. This dam with the large power house stretches across the entire width of the river. There are, of course, sluice-gates and a spillway and on top of the spillway are placed removable flash boards seven feet high to further raise the level of the water when necessary. Farther upstream from Hemmings falls, a distance of about five and a half miles, was what was known as the Dauphinais rapids. The water level from the foot of the Dauphinais rapids downstream for a distance of about three and a half miles, before the construction by the appellant of the dam at Hemmings falls, gradually fell about one foot. Then from that point to a point approximately five hundred feet below the point where the dam now stands there was a drop in the level of nearly forty-five feet which was what was called the Hemmings falls. As a consequence of the erection of the dam the Hemmings falls rapids were entirely wiped out and about two-thirds of the Dauphinais rapids were wiped out, and the level of the river between the head of Hemmings falls rapids and the foot of the Dauphinais rapids was raised 9\u00b72 feet.\nThe basis of the claim against the appellant is that the tremendous rush of water and ice that so suddenly washed out the railway embankment on the day in question was the direct result of the interference of the appellant with the natural condition of the St. Francis river by the obstructions caused by the erection and maintenance by the appellant of its two dams, the one built in 1918 about 1,100 feet upstream from the railway bridge, and, principally, the other dam, constructed in 1925 at Hemmings falls. Did the damage result from these works of the appellant? That is the real problem in this case. And it is almost entirely, if not entirely, a question of fact. The substantial defences to the action were: (1) That the events which took place on the occasion of the ice break of 1928 were brought about by causes of nature that were entirely abnormal and to which the existence of the dam had no reference. Great formations of ice, unusually heavy rainfall, sudden rise of temperature, were said to have united in creating such a combination of abnormal natural conditions as to cause the accident without reference to the existence of the dams. (2) That if the dam had in fact any influence upon the situation, it acted as a regulator and moderator controlling to some extent the spring floods and distributing their effect so as to reduce what would otherwise have been a worse condition. (3) That the railway had itself been negligent in continuing to use the old gravel embankment, having regard to the history of the conditions on the river which had occurred periodically during some years past, and which called for precautionary measures on the part of the railway company in the construction of a substantial structure to carry the tracks between the viaduct over an adjacent highway and the bridge in question. (4) That having regard to the known condition of the river during two or three days before the accident, the railway company should have taken heed of the probability of the embankment being washed out and have watched the place of the embankment to guard against any train passing over until satisfied that it was safe to do so. I purposely refrain for the moment from discussing other questions of defence that go to liability, if any, in respect of the different classes of claims treated separately. The basic problem is the general question whether or not the washout of the railway embankment resulted directly from the existence of the works of the appellant in the river. And that is a question of fact.\nThe learned trial judge put his conclusion in these words:\nAfter weighing carefully all the evidence, oral and literal, I can reach no other conclusion than that the dam of the defendant company at Hemmings falls was responsible for the washout of the railway embankment at Drummondville on Sunday, April 8, 1928.\nThe trial of the action took fourteen days. There are 959 pages of evidence besides 133 exhibits, including maps, plans, profiles, charts, photographs, records, water levels, records of flow, meteorological reports, vouchers, etc. More than one hundred witnesses gave evidence at the trial and over sixty per centum of the oral testimony was given in French. The learned trial judge, with his mastery of both the English and the French languages, was specially qualified to fully appreciate the oral testimony and has with great care minutely reviewed all the evidence in a judgment extending to fifty-eight pages. He heard and saw the expert witnesses and all the lay witnesses, the latter being mostly residents in the vicinity who described what they saw and told what they knew not only of the immediate events of the accident but of the happenings upon the river over the past many years. On a question of fact as to whether the damage to the railway embankment was caused by the existence of the works of the appellant, the trial judge was in a particularly advantageous position to properly weigh the mass of contradictory testimony and it would need something very clear and definite in the evidence to satisfy any court of appeal that findings of fact of a trial judge in such a case should be reversed. Counsel for the appellant very ably presented to us their analysis of the evidence in support of their contention that the trial judge had upon the evidence reached a wrong conclusion. During a lengthy argument they raised in our minds at times certain doubts but the very nature of the problem is such that one cannot look for certainty and must be content upon the balance of probabilities as to whether or not there was any direct relation between the existence of the dam and the damage to the embankment. A careful study of the evidence in the light of the arguments presented to us by counsel for the appellant has failed to satisfy me that the trial judge was wrong in the conclusion that he reached on the general question of liability.\nNo useful purpose is to be served by reviewing again the evidence in the case. The main defence of the appellant was that the accident was simply the result of a combination of natural forces and should be attributed to the act of God. In the carefully prepared factum presented to this Court by counsel for the appellant it is stated that they believe they are\nin a position to successfully demonstrate that the evidence, although contradictory on many points, confirms\ntheir contention. Where the question is one of fact and the evidence is admittedly \u201ccontradictory on many points,\u201d the findings of fact by the trial judge cannot lightly be disturbed. Counsel for the appellant in discussing the evidence complain that in their view the learned trial judge rejected as a whole the evidence adduced by the experts and improperly declined to accept the evidence of the appellant\u2019s expert witnesses; improperly, they say, because in their opinion the expert evidence on behalf of the appellant was consistent and the expert evidence on behalf of the respondent disclosed contradictory theories. There were three expert witnesses called by the respondent and four by the appellant. The evidence of all these witnesses was largely theoretical and we could quite appreciate the trial judge, if he had done so, disregarding such evidence and seeking a solution of the problem before him in the evidence of about one hundred lay witnesses who told from their own actual experiences and observations over a period of many years of the action of the St. Francis river at the time of spring floods and of the carrying off of the ice jams at the end of the winter seasons. But in point of fact the trial judge did not disregard the evidence of the expert witnesses. He has in his judgment carefully reviewed the evidence of these witnesses, taking first the expert evidence on one side and then the expert evidence on the other side. Having done that, he says that he found himself in a certain state of perplexity not only because the evidence of all the witnesses consisted largely in statements of theory but because these witnesses differed fundamentally among themselves. It was then that the trial judge turned to the evidence of the lay witnesses for an appreciation of the real facts in the case. Counsel for the appellant contend that a case of this nature should be determined largely upon evidence of witnesses who speak from certain precise data and known principles of science and that it is upon such evidence and not upon evidence of laymen who have not at their command such data or scientific knowledge that such a question as is involved in this action should be determined. In my view the trial judge approached the evidence, and I think rightly, in this manner: Having carefully reviewed and considered the evidence of all the expert witnesses and finding marked differences of opinion among them, he turned to the great mass of lay evidence and then accepted the theory of those experts that was consistent with the evidence of those lay witnesses whose evidence he accepted because of their practical experience and credibility. It is plain that the trial judge was much impressed with the evidence of one Mercure. Mercure lived for nearly fifty years in Drummondville alongside the river between the locations of the Drummondville dam and of the Hemmings falls dam. He had driven lumber down the river every spring for about forty years. He had a wide experience on the St. Francis river, at least in the section of it with which we are concerned. He had known the river in its different conditions, first in a state of nature, then with the dam that the town of Drummondville erected in 1896, later with the dam the appellant built in 1918 replacing the wooden dam that the town had built in 1896, and finally with the large dam and power house built across the river at Hemmings falls by the appellant in 1925. The result of his evidence was that before the dam at Hemmings falls was built there had never been floods as considerable as the one of 1928 and that there had never been ice jams of the size of those which had formed since the construction of that dam. He stated that prior to the erection of the dam and power house in 1925 there were rapids with a drop of over thirty feet and that ice very seldom formed in those rapids and that, when it did, it was not solid. He said that the long and wide basin of deep and still water created by the dam upstream a distance of about five and a half miles was an ideal \u201cvessel,\u201d to use his expression, for the formation of ice and the accumulation of frazil. Mercure had been accustomed, prior to the construction of the dam, to place logs during the winter months on the slope of the river bank to be taken away in the spring, and he said that if he had done the same in 1928 the logs would have been covered with at least twenty feet of ice. I quote the words of the trial judge:\nMercure is not expounding theories, but relating facts whereof he has been witness. He has rafted logs on the St. Francis river since 1885; he knows all the holes and nooks in the river; he has seen the river in its natural state and also since it has been dammed at Drummondville and later at Hemmings falls; he witnessed all the ice break-ups and spring floods for over forty-five years and always took a keen interest in them, as every spring he was waiting for the river to get clear to start floating his logs. I believe his testimony is of great value to the Court * * * he impressed me as being frank and honest and I have no reason not to believe his testimony. Besides, Mercure is corroborated by a number of witnesses, particularly with respect to the greater seriousness of the floods and jams since the construction of the Hemmings falls dam and the fact that, prior to such construction, the ice below the Dauphinais rapids always left in the spring before the ice from upstream arrived.\nThe trial judge then directs attention in his judgment to particular portions of the evidence of thirteen witnesses in corroboration generally of Mercure\u2019s evidence, and concluded that he saw no reason to believe that the ice and water running down normally in the river in a state of nature, though somewhat more abundant than in previous years as a result of persistently mild weather, would have been sufficient to damage the railway embankment. That conclusion was reached after a careful review of all the evidence of both the expert and the lay witnesses, and is a conclusion that agrees entirely with the evidence of the expert witness, McLaghlan. McLaghlan is an hydraulic engineer who has been employed by the Department of Railways and Canals since 1907. He made a special study of the St. Francis river during the two months prior to the trial of the action. Asked directly,\nWhat is the cause of this washout suffered by the railway at Drummondville on the 8th April, 1928?\nhe answered:\nThe accident to the Canadian National Railway was brought about by the state of the Hemmings falls dam without question. The building of that dam caused the jam to occur at a point it would not occur in nature. That jam was of such a nature that the people operating that plant could not control it, and it broke and went away at a time which shows itself the nature of the force on it.\nAnd again he says:\nThat jam was caused by the dam, and the impounding of the water was caused by the jam, all attributable to the building of the Hemmings falls dam. Why? Because that Hemmings falls dam transferred a jam from below the rapids where it impounded practically nothing to a point upstream where it impounded an enormous quantity of water.\n* * *\nThat excess flow was caused by the jam, suddenly breaking; the jam itself was caused by the building of the Hemmings falls dam where it is * * * The whole accident is traceable directly to interfering with nature by building the Hemmings falls dam at a point which was not suitable to stowing the ice that comes out of that river in the break-up period.\nUpon the evidence the learned trial judge said he could reach no other conclusion than that the dam at Hemmings falls was responsible for the washout of the railway embankment at Drummondville. But counsel for the appellant argue that it was not fair for the trial judge to accept the evidence of Mercure in that he had a personal interest in the claim the Mercure Company had against the appellant for damages resulting from the floods of 1927 and 1928 and had assisted financially or otherwise in support of two other claims against the appellant, and was therefore vitally interested in this litigation. That was undoubtedly something that had to be seriously considered by the learned trial judge in weighing the evidence of Mercure. It was a powerful basis of attack by the appellant upon the whole evidence of Mercure but the trial judge saw and heard the witness and was told the facts upon which the alleged bias of the witness was asserted and notwithstanding this the trial judge said:\nI do not think that this can in the least affect the credibility of the witness; he impressed me as being frank and honest and I have no reason not to believe his testimony.\nIt seems to me quite impossible for us upon an appeal, accepting as we should the learned trial judge\u2019s view of the credibility of witnesses and his findings of fact on evidence that was admittedly contradictory both on theories and on facts, to set aside the finding made by the trial judge upon the main issue unless it is abundantly plain that he was obviously wrong in his conclusion. Not only do I think that there is nothing substantial to satisfy us that the trial judge was wrong but I think his conclusion was right.\nMuch stress was laid by counsel for the appellant upon their contention that having regard to the combination of abnormal natural forces it was really a case of vis major or damnum fatale. Great quantities of ice formed during the severe winter; heavy rainfall and high temperature followed in the spring; all of which were said to have constituted a combination of natural forces so unprecedented and beyond the control of the appellant as to relieve it of any liability. But all the evidence on this view of the action was carefully considered by the trial judge. This question involved a consideration of the evidence of other somewhat similar floods and ice jams in the St. Francis river at the same location in other years, particularly in 1887, 1913, 1915 and 1921, and a great deal of evidence was directed to these events, before the construction of the Hemmings falls dam, and to the severe flood and break-up in 1927 after the construction of the dam. Evidence was also given about the flood of 1932 (the accident in question in this case was in 1928). The trial judge was satisfied on the evidence that the three worst floods in the section of the river with which we are concerned were those of 1927, 1928 and 1932, and that the floods in 1887, 1915 and 1921 were lesser floods, and he found it difficult to think that this was a mere coincidence. I again quote the exact words of the trial judge:\nI am convinced that these dams, particularly and to a much greater extent the dam at Hemmings falls, had the effect of facilitating and increasing the formation of sheet ice and the accumulation of broken ice and frazil underneath or behind it. The five and a half mile basin above Hemmings falls dam impounded enormous quantities of water, ice and frazil. Such a state of affairs is unquestionably conducive to the formation of ice jams of large proportion. Jams may have formed at the foot of Hemmings falls rapids prior to the construction of the dam, but in no wise comparable to those which formed upstream after the dam was erected. And I am satisfied that a jam formed at the foot of the Hemmings falls rapids, under natural conditions, would have gone down during the break-up period in an open river, before any ice jams at Labont\u00e9\u2019s, at Dauphinais\u2019, at Ulverton rapids, at Richmond or at any other place upstream would have reached the Hemmings falls rapids, as it has been asserted by several witnesses, all of them well acquainted with the behaviour of the river prior to the construction of the dam.\nThat there was a combination in the spring of 1928 of natural forces of an unusual nature is apparent from the evidence but that does not, as a matter of law, entitle the situation to be treated at damnum fatale or vis major. In the House of Lords in Greenock Corporation v. Caledonian Railway[2], referred to by the learned trial judge in his judgment, it is laid down to be the duty of any one who interferes with the course of a stream to see that the works which he substitutes for the channel provided by nature are adequate to carry off the water brought down even by extraordinary rainfall, and if damage results from the deficiency of the substitute which he has provided for the natural channel he will be liable. In that case a municipal authority, in laying out a park, constructed a concrete paddling pond for children in the bed of a stream and altered the course of the stream and obstructed the natural flow of water therefrom. Owing to a rainfall of extraordinary violence the stream overflowed at the pond, and, as the result of the operations of the authority, a great volume of water, which would have been carried off by the stream in its natural course without mischief, poured down a public street into the town and damaged the property of two railway companies. It was held that the extraordinary rainfall was not a damnum fatale which absolved the authority from responsibility, and that they were liable in damages to the railway companies. Lord Dunedin there quotes with approval the language of Lord Westbury, L.C., in Tennent v. Earl of Glasgow[3],\nIf anything be done by an individual which interferes with natural occurrences, such as, for example, in Lord Orkney\u2019s case[4], throwing a dam across the course of a stream, it is undoubtedly the duty of that individual so to construct the work as to provide in an efficient manner, not only against usual occurrences and ordinary state of things, but also to provide against things which are unusual and extraordinary. The Greenock case[5] was a Scottish case but we find Lord Haldane in the House of Lords in the English case of Attorney-General and others v. Cory Brothers and Company Limited[6] referring to the Greenock case5 in these words:\nThe rainfall proved to have occurred at the period of the slide was no doubt unusually heavy, but it was of no unique character, nor of such as ought not to have been foreseen as possible. It could not be contended that it amounted to an \u201cact of God,\u201d to what is called in the jurisprudence of Scotland, a damnum fatale. Indeed, were your Lordships inclined to take a different view, you would be precluded from doing so by the judgment of this House in the recent case of Greenock Corporation v. Caledonian Railway Co.5.\nThe Greenock case5 was subsequently referred to in the Privy Council in a Quebec case, Montreal City v. Watt and Scott Limited[7], in the judgment delivered by Lord Dunedin.\nThe evidence in this case, tested by the standard laid down in the Greenock v. Caledonian Railway case5, was held by the learned trial judge not to constitute a damnum fatale or vis major and so relieve the appellant from liability. In that view of the evidence I entirely agree.\nThen it was argued by counsel for the appellant that, in any event, the washout of the railway embankment was really due to the fault of the railway company itself in continuing to use the old gravel embankment instead of replacing it with a substantial modern structure, and it was suggested that if the alleged negligence of the railway company did not constitute a complete defence to the action, it at least constituted contributory negligence and would involve an apportionment between the parties of the amount of damages sustained. It is plain that the law of Quebec, unlike the law of England, as was admitted in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fr\u00e9chette[8], and referred to by Lord Dunedin in the concluding paragraph of his judgment in the Privy Council in the City of Montreal case7, enjoins apportionment of the damage where there has been a negligence of the plaintiff contributing to the accident and their Lordships in the Privy Council in the City of Montreal7 case agreed that the doctrine is applicable to modify a liability established by article 1054 of the Civil Code. But this action is not founded, except incidentally as to the use of some dynamite and the operation of the gates in the spillway, upon the ground of negligence; it is in substance a case of nuisance. I cannot think that if what I have upon my property has adequately served my purpose for fifty years or more there is any duty in law upon me to protect it against what may be the result of the establishment and maintenance of a nuisance created by my neighbour upon his land. As between the owner of a dam and other persons, it may not be a question of negligence in construction or operation of the dam but the fact of the interference with the natural level and flow of the river caused by the obstruction in the river, that may give rise to a liability to the other persons to whom a duty lies not to interfere with the natural level and flow of the river, notwithstanding that there be no negligence in the actual construction or operation of the dam. Of course if statutory power is given to construct the works without reserving any remedy to private persons adversely affected, that is a different case as was pointed out by Lord Macnaghten in East Fremantle Corp. v. Annois[9].\nQuite apart from the question of law, the fact is that the railway embankment had withstood all the spring floods and break-ups since the time it was built in 1887. The section of the railway line where the embankment was located was inspected daily by the railway as to the state of repair and the evidence satisfied the trial judge that the embankment was in good condition at the time the accident occurred. It undoubtedly would have been an act of wisdom, in the light of what happened, for the railway company to have discarded this old gravel embankment and substituted for it a substantial modern structure for carrying the tracks between the bridge and the viaduct over the highway. But if, as it has been found, the embankment was washed away by conditions which directly resulted from the obstruction in the river of the appellant\u2019s dam and power house, it is no answer to the respondent\u2019s claim for the damage to the embankment that the railway might have constructed something so substantial at that point as to withstand the force of the ice jam on the day of the accident. When the appellant undertook the construction and maintenance of its works in and across the St. Francis river, it is not disputed that it had lawful governmental authority to do so. But it took that authority subject to the obligation of becoming responsible for all damages that might result therefrom to any person. That is the effect of sec. 12 of the Quebec Water-Course Act, which I have set out above. It was argued that the words in that section, \u201cwhether by excessive elevation of the flood-gates or otherwise,\u201d only refer to damage that may occur upstream and not to damage that may occur downstream and that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d should be confined to such things as flood-gates. But in my view that is too narrow an interpretation to put upon the section. It seems to me plain that the legislature intended that the words \u201call damages resulting therefrom to any person\u201d should embrace damages whether they occur above or below the obstruction in the river that result from any of the works of the owner or lessee. It is true that the appellant was put by the statute into the position of being able lawfully to construct, maintain and operate its works but only under the condition subsequent that it should, notwithstanding that there was no injuria, pay, under a liability imposed by the statute, for the damnum which should from time to time prove to have been occasioned to any person therefrom.\nA case against the appellant was incidentally attempted to be made on the ground of alleged negligence of the appellant in two respects. One was the fact that the appellant exploded about 200 pounds of thermite in the river on the morning of the day of the accident at a point some distance upstream from the Hemmings falls dam with the object of relieving the pressure. The other ground of alleged negligence was the manipulation of the sluice-gates by the appellant during the day before as well as during the day of the accident. Nothing much turned upon either of these complaints. The trial judge found that the explosion of the thermite had very little effect. As to the operation of the sluice-gates, he was inclined to think that the disaster might have been averted had the appellant manipulated its sluice-gates in such a manner as to lower the level of the water in the basin as much as possible by opening the four gates wider from the time the weather turned decidedly mild and the inflow increased (on Thursday preceding the Sunday of the accident) until after the final break-up on Sunday afternoon. The appellant operated the gates to keep the water at a certain level in order to use its turbines. But the trial judge treated this matter as of little, if any, practical importance, because of the conclusion he had reached that the dam itself, independently of the manner in which the sluice-gates had been operated, had been responsible for the washout of the embankment.\nThe amount of the claim for damages to the embankment is not questioned by the appellant, if there be liability. Therefore upon the grounds above stated I think the judgment must be sustained in respect of the items in what I described in opening as the first of the three classes of claims involved in the action. The first class as so described consists of items D and E in paragraph 8 of the Information, which items aggregate $18,259.04.\nThat brings us to a consideration of the items in what I have described as the second class of claims, being the cost of repairs to the locomotive and cars and the cost of auxiliary and wrecking train service, diversion of train service, and special train service resulting from the interruption to traffic on the railway line in the section in which the embankment was located. These are items A, B, C, G, H and I, aggregating $43,671.81. This branch of the case has given me a good deal of trouble. Almost at the moment that the embankment was washed out, the passenger train reached that point. Can liability properly be put upon the appellant for that portion of the respondent\u2019s damages that consisted in the destruction or damage of the locomotive and the cars and in the cost necessarily involved in rearrangement of train service? Is the liability for damage resulting from the construction and maintenance of the works of the appellant confined to such damages as might reasonably have been anticipated by the appellant? The authorities seem to establish that when it is found that a man ought to have foreseen in a general way consequences of a certain kind, it will not affect him to say that he could not foresee the precise course or the full extent of the consequences which in fact happened. If liability is once established by proof of the relation of cause and effect, then under the authorities as I understand them those damages that flow directly are recoverable. The appellant alleges, however, that it was the respondent\u2019s own fault that the train in question was permitted to reach the point of the embankment at the time it did on the day in question, having regard to the notice or knowledge which it is argued the respondent had of the probability of the embankment being washed out that day. Emphasis is laid by counsel for the appellant upon the fact proved in evidence that a day or two before the accident the railway tracks at the village of Richmond, 25 miles away from Drummondville, were all under water, traffic interrupted there and the flood so great as to put the railway upon its guard against great ice jams and flood waters reaching the railway bridge with great force within a day or two and the probability of the washout that actually happened. Further it is argued that the respondent knew of the weakness of its gravel embankment to withstand a spring break-up of the extent that existed at that time. Much was made in the argument before us of a cavity in the embankment shewn on a photograph put in at the trial. Further it was argued that the respondent\u2019s railway officials at Drummondville should have been alert at least an hour or so before the embankment was washed out, and have given the train ample signals not to proceed across the St. Francis river unless satisfied that there was no danger. During the argument I was rather impressed with these contentions and I have given them anxious consideration. The destruction of the embankment itself was one thing. The damage to the locomotive and cars stands on a different footing. It is difficult to see how the loss of the embankment could have been avoided but it is not unreasonable to suggest that the train might have been stopped before it reached the point of the calamity. The trial judge carefully considered the facts upon which this contention was based and after all it is a question of fact. As to notice and knowledge of the respondent at Richmond, it seems to me that Richmond being 25 miles away it is too much to impose upon the respondent that the railway agents or servants at Richmond should have anticipated what actually happened a day or two later at the railway bridge at Drummondville. Those in charge of the power house and dam of the appellant at Hemmings falls were sufficiently alert to the existence of the ice jam and its probable movements the very day of the accident to go upstream and explode two hundred pounds of thermite at two different places in the basin, and if they had themselves expected that the railway embankment only two and a half miles downstream from the dam might be washed out, they undoubtedly would have notified the respondent\u2019s representative at Drummondville to be on guard. They did not foresee what actually happened and no blame is attached to them for not foreseeing the danger at the railway bridge and I cannot see that we would be justified in attaching blame to the officials of the respondent at Richmond 25 miles or more away. Then as to the cavity in the embankment, shewn in the photograph, as indicating the knowledge that the railway had or ought to have had of the risk of the embankment being carried away in any severe breakup. The evidence as to this photograph was all carefully considered by the trial judge. The photograph was taken in 1918, ten years before the accident, by an engineer named Dick of the contracting firm of Morrow & Beatty which was at that time engaged in building the appellant\u2019s first dam and power house at Drummondville\u2014the dam that replaced the town\u2019s wooden dam in 1918 almost 1,100 feet from the bridge. Dick said the photograph was taken a day or two after the break-up of that year had occurred. It shews a cavity near the end of the embankment on the west side of the river looking from upstream. Dick was unable to give the dimensions of the cavity but a witness named Toupin said he saw the cavity in question, that it was about five feet long by two feet wide and that it seemed bigger on the photograph than it really was. In the opinion of Toupin, who had been a section foreman for the respondent, the cavity did not affect the solidity of the embankment. He said repairs were made three or four months later and it was the only cavity he had ever noticed. The trial judge inclined to the view that the cavity did not have as much importance as the witness Dick was disposed to ascribe to it and the trial judge was not convinced that the cavity was caused exclusively by the action of ice and water, but that the continual use of this part of the embankment by people desiring to go to the river may have been the origin of a hole in the embankment and once the surface had been broken it would take less and less force and time to wear away the inner part of the gravel embankment. This being the view of the trial judge on the evidence as to the cavity that temporarily existed in 1918, it would be difficult for us to impute to the respondent any blame arising out of this incident. Then as to the failure of the officials of the respondent in the immediate vicinity of Drummondville to warn the oncoming train, there is no evidence to shew that any official of the respondent at or near Drummondville had any such notice or knowledge of the probability of the washout occurring as to put the blame for the destruction or damage to the locomotive and the cars upon the respondent itself.\nThe quantum of damages not being questioned in the appeal, the judgment in so far as it relates to the second class of items in the claim must for the reasons above stated, be affirmed.\nThen as to the items of damages which I described for convenience as the third class, being items under F. in paragraph 8 of the Information, aggregating $18,992.35. These items consist of actual payments made by the railway for medical and hospital services, funeral and ambulance expenses, indemnities to passengers and to employees, compensation to the heirs of employees who were killed, wages paid to the disabled conductor, and a grant of $600 to the woman who flagged the oncoming train. All these items were allowed, except the $600 item for flagging the train. Now the railway was not an insurer of the lives of either its passengers or its employees. If it was the negligence of the railway company that caused the personal injuries or death of some of the passengers and employees on the train, the respondent could not succeed in the action. The whole case was brought by the respondent upon the basis that the appellant\u2019s works in the river had been the direct cause of the accident and that being so the respondent became under no legal obligation to either the passengers or employees on the train. The railway made these substantial payments as compassionate allowances on its part if its position in this action as to the liability of the appellant is right. These payments were made without any litigation between the parties and without any notice to or knowledge by the appellant. The respondent has not made out a case for these payments within article 1141 C.C. or established any agency, and these items in the claim cannot be allowed. They were allowed by the learned trial judge at $18,992.35 and the total amount of the judgment directed to be entered by the learned judge against the appellant in the sum of $80,923.20 must be reduced by the said sum of $18,992.35.\nI would vary the judgment appealed from by reducing the amount thereof by the said sum of $18,992.35 and would allow the appellant its costs of this appeal.\nCannon J.\u2014The facts that gave rise to this litigation are amply set forth in the very carefully prepared notes of my brother Davis. I feel that I should explain how I have reached a conclusion under the laws of Quebec, which are found in the following articles of the code:\nOf real servitudes.\nGeneral provisions.\n499. A real servitude is a charge imposed on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor.\n500. It arises either from the natural position of the property, or from the law, or it is established by the act of man.\n501. Lands on a lower level are subject towards those on a higher level to receive such waters as flow from the latter naturally and without the agency of man.\nThe proprietor of the lower land cannot; raise any dam to prevent this flow. The proprietor of the higher land can do nothing to aggravate the servitude of the lower land.\n503. He whose land borders on a running stream, not forming part of the public domain, may make use of it as it passes, for the utility of his land, but in such manner as not to prevent the exercise of the same right by those to whom it belongs; saving the provisions contained in chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes for Lower Canada, or other special enactments.\nHe whose land is crossed by such stream may use it within the whole space of its course through the property, but subject to the obligation of allowing it to take its usual course when it leaves his land.\n508. The law subjects proprietors to different obligations with regard to one another independently of any stipulation.\nChapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes for Lower Canada, which was originally enacted as 19-20 Vict., ch. 104, and is now found in ch. 46 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1925), gives to the riparian owner the right to erect dams to utilize the stream but provides that such owner of any such works shall be liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood gates or otherwise. In Jean v. Gauthier[10], the Court of Review, composed of Stuart, Casault and Caron, JJ., considered the effect of this amendment to the common law, which the late Chief Justice Casault explains as follows:\nAvant le 1er juillet 1856, l\u2019emploi comme pouvoir moteur des rivi\u00e8res et des cours d\u2019eau n\u2019\u00e9tait permis aux propri\u00e9taires riverains qu\u2019\u00e0 la condition de ne faire aucun dommage aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines. Si les chauss\u00e9es, les \u00e9cluses ou les digues requises pour obtenir d\u2019un pouvoir d\u2019eau la force motrice n\u00e9cessaire pour exploiter un moulin, une manufacture ou une usine faisaient d\u00e9border les eaux sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines, ou y causaient d\u2019autres dommages, celui qui les avait construites sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait viol\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle de droit qui met \u00e0 la jouissance de sa chose la condition qu\u2019il ne fera pas tort \u00e0 celle du voisin.\nAussi le propri\u00e9taire du terrain qui souffrait de ces constructions avait, outre le droit de recouvrer les dommages qu\u2019elles lui causaient, celui de les faire changer, et m\u00eame d\u00e9truire, quand la destruction seule pouvait mettre fin au tort qu\u2019il en souffrait. A cette date, la l\u00e9gislature a rendu licite ce qui ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas auparavant, et a permis, comme l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, ce qui jusque-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait la violation du droit d\u2019autrui. L\u2019acte 19-20 Vict., 104 (S.R.B.C. 51) a permis au propri\u00e9taire l\u2019exploitation des cours d\u2019eau sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en y construisant des usines, moulins et manufactures, et l\u2019\u00e9rection dans le cours d\u2019eau, pour cette fin, de chauss\u00e9es, digues, \u00e9cluses et autres travaux; il n\u2019a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux propri\u00e9taires voisins qui en pourraient souffrir que le droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, et ne leur a conserv\u00e9 celui de demander la d\u00e9molition des travaux que comme accessoire du premier, savoir, dans le cas seul o\u00f9 la compensation ne serait pas pay\u00e9e. C\u2019est une servitude l\u00e9gale qu\u2019a cr\u00e9\u00e9e cette loi, servitude analogue \u00e0 celle de mitoyennet\u00e9 entre propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines, et \u00e0 celle du passage pour l\u2019enclave.\nLes dommages et les indemnit\u00e9s que r\u00e9serve la loi n\u2019ont pas un caract\u00e8re autre que le prix qu\u2019est oblig\u00e9 de payer, pour la partie du terrain et du mur qui y est assis, le voisin qui veut en acqu\u00e9rir la mitoyennet\u00e9, ou que la valeur du terrain que l\u2019enclav\u00e9 veut affecter \u00e0 son passage.\n* * *\nMais, entre le propri\u00e9taire des travaux et celui de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage qui en souffre, dommages signifient indemnit\u00e9 pour la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration que les constructions font subir \u00e0 son bien. Cette indemnit\u00e9 ne peut par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre demand\u00e9e que par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds que la loi a fait servant \u00e0 celui du fonds qu\u2019elle a fait dominant, ou par celui de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 \u00e0 celui des travaux qui le d\u00e9t\u00e9riorent.\nIn Breakey v. Carter[11], Casault, J., referred to Jean v. Gauthier10 and said:\nJ\u2019ajouterai, comme je l\u2019ai fait dans cette cause de Jean v. Gauthier10, qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir ni d\u00e9lit ni quasi-d\u00e9lit dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, et que le recours pour le prix de son obtention, ou pour Yindemnit\u00e9 que doit payer pour son exercice le propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant au fonds servant n\u2019est pas soumis \u00e0 la prescription de deux ans \u00e0 laquelle le code (art. 2261) soumet le recours pour dommages r\u00e9sultat de d\u00e9lits ou de quasi-d\u00e9lits.\nThis case of Breakey v. Carter11 came before this court which confirmed the opinion of Casault, J., that that chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada recognizes the right of a proprietor to erect works which may have the effect of damming back the water on a neighbouring property, the construction of a dam having that effect, could not be considered a quasi-d\u00e9lit, but rather as a right of servitude which gave to him who was injured by it a legal recourse for indemnity for the damage. (Cassel\u2019s digest, p. 464, 12th May, 1885).\nIn Gale v. Bureau[12], the present Chief Justice said, at p. 312:\nThe effect of that decision[13] (by which this Court is bound) is that the right given by article 7295 (or the then Revised Statutes of Quebec), in so far as it justifies the penning back the waters of a stream upon the upper riparian proprietors, is to be regarded as a right of servitude to which is attached an obligation to indemnify the proprietor who is prejudiced by the exercise of it.\nAnother case, Proulx v. Tremblay[14], dealing with damages caused by the erection and operation of a dam to a proprietor below the dam may be considered as helpful to apply the provisions of the statutes to the present case where the damages claimed were caused by the respondent railway\u2019s embankment situate at some distance below the appellant\u2019s dams. Sir L. N. Casault says at p. 358:\nIl n\u2019est pas douteux que cette disposition statutaire (S.R.B.C. ch. 51) a fait l\u00e9gal ce qui auparavant \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal, et a permis de faire des eaux courantes un usage que le droit ant\u00e9rieur n\u2019autorisait pas et une appropriation qu\u2019il prohibait. Avant la passation de ce statut, le propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur eut pu forcer celui du fonds sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 enlever les barrages et les obstacles qui emp\u00eachaient les eaux communes d\u2019arriver librement \u00e0 son fonds. Quelles qu\u2019utiles qu\u2019eussent pu \u00eatre, pour le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur ou m\u00eame pour le public, les usines ou les machines que ces barrages servaient \u00e0 alimenter et \u00e0 mettre en mouvement, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds inf\u00e9rieur ou sup\u00e9rieur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019en subir les inconv\u00e9nients si petits qu\u2019ils fussent; il pouvait exiger leur destruction. Cette loi ne leur a permis d\u2019obtenir la d\u00e9molition des ouvrages, qui retenaient les eaux sur les cours d\u2019eau pour les besoins d\u2019une usine ou d\u2019une manufacture quelconque, que lorsque l\u2019usinier ou le manufacturier n\u00e9gligeait l\u2019accomplissement de la condition qu\u2019elle mettait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019elle conf\u00e9rait. Cette condition \u00e9tait le paiement des dommages que pouvait causer \u00e0 autrui l\u2019usage que faisait de l\u2019eau le propri\u00e9taire des machines qu\u2019elle servait. Elle est \u00e9crite \u00e0 la section 2 de l\u2019acte comme suit:\nSect. 2. Les propri\u00e9taires ou fermiers des dits \u00e9tablissements resteront garants de tous dommages qui pourront en r\u00e9sulter ou \u00eatre caus\u00e9s \u00e0 autrui, soit par la trop grande \u00e9l\u00e9vation des \u00e9cluses ou autrement.\nCette derni\u00e8re expression, ou autrement, ne laisse aucun recours \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert, elle les comprend tous; et met aussi bien \u00e0 couvert le dommage que peut causer la r\u00e9tention de l\u2019eau que celui qui r\u00e9sulte de son extension ou \u00e9panchement sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines. Elle emp\u00eache la restriction aux dommages caus\u00e9s par la trop grande \u00e9l\u00e9vation des \u00e9cluses des droits qu\u2019elle sauvegarde, lors m\u00eame que cette mention sp\u00e9ciale ne serait par l\u00e0 simplement pour exemple et qu\u2019elle aurait une tendance limitative et exclusive qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas.\n* * *\nJ\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0, dans la cause de Jean v. Gauthier[15], exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que le statut 19-20 Vict., ch. 104, avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude qui, comme toutes les servitudes l\u00e9gales qui s\u2019acqui\u00e8rent, ne peut s\u2019exercer qu\u2019en en payant le prix. Le d\u00e9fendeur ne peut appuyer que sur ce statut ou mieux celui qui le refond, le droit qu\u2019il invoque de retenir pour les besoins de son moulin les eaux de la rivi\u00e8re Giasson; c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019exercice de la servitude qu\u2019a cr\u00e9\u00e9e cette loi, il ne peut pas l\u2019exercer au d\u00e9triment des fonds servants sans leur payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui en est le prix. Cette indemnit\u00e9 est pour le demandeur la valeur des dommages que lui cause la r\u00e9tention de l\u2019eau.\nIn the same case of Proulx v. Tremblay[16], Stuart, J., while agreeing with the views of Casault, J., that, before the passing of the statute, a dam could not legally be placed across rivers to retain the waters, goes even further, when he says:\nThe claim for damages must rest, not upon the act of erecting the dam, but upon its improper construction and the abuse of the licence which the law gave him.\n* * *\nThe law of servitudes must necessarily affect the decision of a case like this, and may properly be referred to.\n* * *\nThe plaintiff in this case is proprietor of the land on the lower level which is subject to the servitude of receiving such waters as flow from the land of the defendant which is on the higher land, naturally and without the agency of man. He complains not that the defendant aggravates his servitude, but that he arrest the flow for a time, by means of a dam established for his own utility. The prohibition which existed at common law to construct a dam attached to the proprietor of the lower level, not to the proprietor of the higher level. And the reason is manifest in the text. The certain result of a dam is to raise the level of the river and to cause a reflow of the waters upon the lands of all those above it, but it in no way aggravates the servitude to which is subject the land of the lower level. Even under the old law the plaintiff would not rest this action upon article 501, and would have to show a special damage irrespective of any falling within the purview of this servitude.\nThe preamble of the statute invoked shews it to have been called for by considerations of public expediency. \u201cVu que l\u2019exploitation des \u201ccours d\u2019eau serait un grand moyen de prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 pour le pays.\u201d 19 and 20 Vict., ch. 104, 1856. Its public design cannot be overlooked in its interpretation, and the interests of the country at large must prevail over private interests. These views are discussed by Mignault, in \u201cDroit Civil,\u201d vol. 3, pp. 25 and 26, and he concludes as follows:\nJe crois que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu pr\u00e9server les droits en limitant toutefois le recours des autres riverains au paiement des dommages qu\u2019il a pu \u00e9prouver.\nFrom the perusal of the above authorities, it seems to me abundantly clear that the damages contemplated by the statute are those suffered by any person as riparian owner, either below or above the dam and would be limited to the actual damages caused to the owner of a riparian piece of land as a result of the construction and maintenance of the dam. Although there is no direct evidence of title to the riparian lots on which the embankment that was destroyed rested, I would assume that the Crown owns the property, is a riparian owner and is bound to receive in its natural state the waters after their use by the appellant for a purpose which must be considered as of public interest.\nThe latter must be held responsible for the damages to any property below the dam by the construction of its works. Although the evidence is somewhat perplexing, I cannot reach the firm conclusion that the trial judge was clearly wrong in his finding that the natural conditions of the river were altered by the construction of the dam and in his view that the ice jam which caused the enormous accumulation of water resulted from the longer, wider and deeper basin created by the appellant. The latter would, therefore, be responsible for the damages caused by the injury to the physical property of the riparian owner; but this would not include the locomotive and rolling stock which happened to reach the site of the embankment shortly after the accident.\nThe codifiers inserted the reference to chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada (now embodied in chapter 46 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec) in title 4 of the Civil Code dealing with real servitudes and in its first chapter dealing with \u201cservitudes which arise from the situation of property.\u201d\nThe obligation to indemnify would, under the statute, result from the sole and direct operation of law and would be one of the obligations described in article 1057 C.C. See on this point the learned discussion by Sir Henry Strong, C.J., in City of Quebec v. The Queen[17].\nThe statutory liability cannot be extended beyond what the law has fixed as the price of the servitude on riparian owners, viz. the damage caused to the owner of any property by the damming of the waters. I would, therefore, award the cost of reconstructing the embankment and the railway track. I would also allow the cost of the temporary railway service during the necessary period of repairs to the embankment and railway track. This cost of maintaining the service may fairly be considered as a damage occasioned to the enjoyment of the right of the respondent as riparian owner. See City of Quebec v. Bastien[18].\nThe respondent also alleged two grounds of special negligence: the use of thermite to break the jam and the opening of the sluice gates which would have started the movement of a tremendous volume of ice and water washing out the railway embankment. The trial judge found that the explosions of the two cans of thermite did not have such effect. He does not find that the respondent\u2019s complaint about the opening of the sluice gates is well founded; on the contrary, he says that the four gates should have been opened wider in order to lower the level of the water in the basin.\nThese findings would eliminate the recovery of damages under article 1053 C.C. Article 1054 does not apply for the reasons given above. The water and ice were not legally under the care nor under the control of the appellant; the latter were in duty bound to restore it to its normal course down the St. Francis river; they are responsible for the mischief if the abnormal flow of the river when it reached the embankment can be traced back to the presence of the dam across the river 2\u00bd miles above.\nPothier (\u00e9d. Bugnet) IV, p. 330, may be quoted:\n235.

The employees in charge did not show the zeal and diligence to be expected under the abnormal conditions facing them, as well as all proprietors along the St. Francis river, on that Sunday afternoon. I agree on this point with Dysart, J. ad hoc.\nEven if the Crown had a recourse for repayment of what was disbursed to pay the railway\u2019s own debt for damages resulting from bodily injuries to the victims of the accident (employees and passengers), I believe that, under Regent Taxi & Transport Coy. v. Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[19], any action for bodily injuries caused by appellant\u2019s negligence was prescribed when brought on the 3rd of September, 1929, as to these special items. Art. 2262, C.C.; art. 1056, C.C.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal in part, with costs to the appellant, and restrict the recovery to the following items: costs of repairs to tracks, $5,254.57; costs of repairs to structure, $13,004.47; costs of diversion of train service and of special train service, $13,158.99, making a total of $31,418.03 with interest from date of the judgment of the trial court and costs.\nThe judgment of Crocket J. and Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by\nDysart J. ad hoc.\u2014The conclusions at which I have arrived in this case are in harmony, as they should be, with relevant Quebec jurisprudence as set forth in the judgment of Cannon, J., but while the conclusions harmonize, the considerations upon which they are founded may be different.\nWe are all in accord that the appellant must be held liable for some damages. The presence of the appellant\u2019s dam in the St. Francis river led directly to the washout of the respondent\u2019s railway embankment, and the appellant must, therefore, make compensation for all damage directly attributable to the washout. The only question on which there is difference of opinion is the extent of the damage for which compensation must be made to the Crown as the owner of the railroad.\nFor my purpose, it will be convenient to divide the claims of the railway company into four groups and to deal with the groups seriatim.\nThe first group will consist of two items,\u2014\u201ccost of repairs to tracks\u201d ($5,254.57) and \u201ccost of repairs to structure\u201d ($13,004.47), a total of $18,259.04. These repairs were required in order to bring the embankment and track back to the condition of passability in which they were immediately before the washout, and do not include the permanent improvements to the embankment which were subsequently made. I agree with both that the appellant must pay this sum as compensation, because the damage is the direct and natural result of the injuries to the embankment.\nThe second group of claims will include two items covering \u201ccost of diversion of train service\u201d ($8,744.78) and \u201ccost of special train service\u201d ($4,414.21), aggregating $13,158.99. I would hold the appellant responsible for this group of damages. The evidence of the details of these items confirms what we had assumed, namely, that these two items of cost were incurred in an attempt to overcome the interruption to train service resulting from the destruction of the road bed,\u2014an interruption which would inevitably have followed from the washout even if the train in question had not been wrecked. The washing away of the road bed by ice and water completely severed the line of rail communication and stopped the passage of all trains, resulting in an interruption which continued from Sunday, April 8, at 4.45 p.m. until Saturday, April 13, at 7.30 p.m. Instead of standing idly by until the necessary repairs could be made to permit of the resumption of train traffic over the embankment, the railway officials acting in the interest of all concerned\u2014the public, the appellant and railway\u2014provided substitute train service, thereby avoiding, as it was their duty to avoid, some of the loss which otherwise would have ensued. The substituted service took two forms: (1) \u201cthrough traffic\u201d between the cities of Quebec and Montreal which had previously been routed via the embankment, was diverted to another route, (2) \u201clocal traffic\u201d for a necessary distance on each side of the washout was taken care of by a series of trains running to and from the washout. These train services were in no wise connected with the loss of the train which went down the embankment, and as I understand it, only that portion of the cost of the services has been charged which might be considered an extra cost occasioned by the washout.\nThe third group of claims includes items for \u201ccosts of repairs\u201d to the locomotive and to two cars ($27,236.20) and an item for \u201ccost of auxiliary and wrecking train service\u201d ($3,276.62), a total of $30,512.82. The appellant should not be held responsible for these costs. I should state that my understanding of the facts in respect of these costs is that the auxiliary and wrecking train service was necessitated by, and devoted to, the recovery and removal of the damaged train, and not to the repair of the road bed, and that, but for the damage to the train, this service would not have been required. It is, therefore, so intimately associated with the damage to the train as to be properly included in the groups of items covering repairs to the train. This group of claims introduces a new link into the chain of causation and calls for some extended comment. Here the conduct of the railway company must be taken into account, because if by the exercise of reasonable precautions on its part, the company which operates the railway could have avoided these damages, the Crown can not now recover for them.\nIn order to determine what, if anything, the railway employees should have done, we must look at the flood situation as it developed and culminated in the washout. The evidence on this point presents its own picture, the features of which should be noted. (1) Spring \u201cbreakups\u201d on the St. Francis river increased in violence after the erection of the dam at Hemmings falls in 1924,\u2014in fact, the railway\u2019s case is based upon that fact; (2) the natural conditions during the first week of April, 1928, were particularly conducive to flooding and violent breakup,\u2014unusually great quantities of snow were melted very rapidly in the exceptionally warm weather of that week, with the result that the river rose to almost unprecedented heights; at Richmond, for instance, twenty-five miles up stream, the river overflowed its banks and covered the railway yards and tracks to a depth of two or three feet, so that men had to be assigned by railway officials to watch and guard railway property at that place; (3) the swollen waters carried great masses of broken ice, and during the two or three days preceding the washout, the river for some miles above the dam was choked with millions of tons of ice; (4) this enormous mass of ice and water, always growing in quantity, slowly forced its way down the river, the ice grounding occasionally on ridges or shallows and halting until an increasing height of water floated the mass and forced it forward; (5) the forefront of the flood reached the broad basin immediately above the dam on Saturday, April 7th, where its progress was delayed for many hours by a large field of unbroken surface ice which covered that basin; (6) the basin ice was eventually lifted by the swelling waters and broken up and became part of the greater mass as that mass moved forward; (7) this final break-up occurred on Sunday, the 8th, and the whole mass of many millions of tons of ice and water rushed over the dam and down the river with terrific force and violence, carrying away the embankment in its mad career; (8) for some days prior to the washout, the local community was well aware of the condition of the river, and many citizens were watching the progress of the flood, and on Sunday, for several hours preceding the final burst, and during its progress, hundreds of citizens lined the banks, watchful and expectant. Although the railway company has, within a few hundred yards of the embankment, a station at which it maintains a staff, its railway officials or employees do not appear to have been on the scene. There is no suggestion that, at any time during the several days preceding the washout nor during the final critical hours, any steps were taken by them to safeguard the trains; (9) even when the washing out process began\u2014and it continued for some little time before finally completed\u2014the only person of all the throng to do anything effective in giving warning to approaching trains was a lady, who, when she heard the distant whistle of an approaching train, ran back along the track and flagged the train in time to enable it to slow down, but not completely to stop; she saved much, but not the engine and the two forward cars\u2014these fell into the newly created cavity.\nCommon knowledge of the conditions which had been prevailing should have been sufficient to put railway officials on guard as to the possibility\u2014not to say probability\u2014of danger to the embankment and connecting bridge with all that such dangers entailed. The mere fact that the power company\u2019s employees did not call upon the railway employees to take precautions does not of itself relieve the latter from performance of their duty\u2014nor mean that the need of precautions was not apparent. We may fairly suppose the appellant\u2019s employees were engrossed in trying to minimize the flooding and to protect their own property, and that they naturally assumed that the railway employees would look after the protection of railway property. In all these circumstances, the failure of the railway employees to safeguard the train was a failure in an obvious duty, and relieves the appellant from responsibility for all damage resulting directly and indirectly from the destruction of the train. This disposes of the third group of claims adversely to the claimant. The fourth and final group of claims consists of \u201cpayments\u201d ($19,592.35) made by the railway company, for \u201cmedical and hospital treatment,\u201d for \u201cambulance and funeral expenses,\u201d for \u201cindemnities\u201d to injured passengers and employees, for \u201cwages to disabled employees,\u201d and for some bounties. I fully agree that these claims cannot be allowed. My reason briefly is that these payments were occasioned by circumstances surrounding the wrecking of the train, and would not have been occasioned at all if the train had not been wrecked. Moreover, the payments were made without established legal obligation.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal to the extent, but only to the extent, of reducing the judgment of the trial court to the sum of $31,418.03, on which interest should be allowed from the date of that judgment. The appellant should have the costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: D\u00e9cary & Marier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. E.

Act, ss. 92 (2), 91 (7) (8).\nThe imposition of the tax on wages by Part I of The Special Income Tax Act of Manitoba, 1933, c. 44, is direct taxation, and is intra vires. The tax is imposed upon the employee; it is not in substance a tax on the employer\u2019s pay roll. Sees. 4, 5, 6 and the second part of s. 7 of the Act do not attempt to impose the tax as such upon the employer but merely provide for the collection and recovery of the tax.\nThe appellants, both resident within the province, one an officer of the permanent force of the active militia of Canada, the other a civil servant of the Dominion Government, were each held to be liable for the said tax in respect of the pay, allowance or wages received by him from the Government of Canada.\nAbbott v. City of Saint John, 40 Can. S.C.R. 597, cited and applied.\nJudgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 42 Man. L.R. 540, 569, affirmed.\nCannon and Crocket JJ. dissented.\nPer Duff C.J.: (1) Even assuming everything in said ss. 4, 5, 6 and second part of s. 7 which imposes any duty or liability upon the employer to be struck from the Act as ultra vires, there would still stand enactments valid and complete for the purpose of making the taxes in question exigible from the taxpayer. (2) Said ss. 4, etc., read by the light of well settled and well known canons of construction, do not extend to the Crown or to the officers of the Crown in the right of the Dominion or of any province, other, at all events, than Manitoba, or to the revenues of the Crown in these respective rights; and further, even if this were not so, the form and character of the legislation is such that the enactments, in so far as they relate to such governments and such revenues, must be treated as severable, and the enactments would still have their full operation as regards other employers and other revenues. (3) Sec. 11 of The Manitoba Interpretation Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 105, precludes the extension of said ss. 4, etc., at least to the Crown in right of the Dominion or in right of any province other than Manitoba.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): A provincial government cannot by a tax such as that in question affect the salary or wages paid, or the pay or allowance made, by the Government of Canada to a Dominion civil servant or a soldier of the permanent force. To do so would impair the status and essential rights of such civil servant or soldier, which are under exclusive Dominion authority. Abbott v. City of Saint John (supra) cannot be regarded as binding in the present case, owing to changes in conditions, and is distinguishable in regard to the nature of the tax there in question. Caron v. The King, 64 Can. S.C.R. 255, [1924] A.C. 990, is distinguishable, having regard to the nature of the position of the person there objecting to the tax. Moreover, it is at least doubtful if the pay and allowances to a soldier of the permanent force of the active militia of Canada are \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of the Act in question, and in construing it (a taxing Act) the subject should be given the benefit of that doubt. Moreover, Part I of the Act attempts to strike first directly at the source of wages, before they reach the employee, expecting direct payment from the employer, and through him to reach the employee indirectly; such legislation is ultra vires; and, having regard to the design of the Act, the part so ultra vires cannot be severed from the provision in s. 7 for payment by the employee, so as to save the latter provision from invalidity (Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada, [1925] A.C. 561, at 568).\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting)\u2014The primary purpose and effect of Part I of the Act is to impose the tax, not upon the employee or upon the income from wages received by him, but upon the earned and accruing wages of the employee in the hands of the employer before they are paid to the employee; and so far as its provisions seek to tax federal salaries or other pay or allowances in the hands of the Government of Canada they are entirely void and inoperative. The provisions of s. 7 purporting to impose upon the employee the liability to pay the tax only in the event of its not having been deducted from his wages and paid by the employer, cannot reasonably be severed, in an action brought against an employee of the Dominion Government, from the provisions of the previous sections, which in their application to the salaries, pay and allowances of civil and other employees of the Dominion Government are ultra vires of the legislature, the liability for payment of the tax having been primarily placed upon the employer and only secondarily or conditionally upon the employee. The secondary liability of the employee cannot fairly be held, in a taxing statute, to stand alone if the primary liability out of which it arises or for which it is substituted is unconstitutional and void. APPEALS by the defendants from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing their appeals from judgments in favour of the plaintiff in the County Court of Winnipeg.\nThe plaintiff, the Attorney-General of the Province of Manitoba, suing for and on behalf of His Majesty the King in the Right of the Province of Manitoba, claimed in each case from the defendant, under the provisions of The Special Income Tax Act, ch. 44 of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1933, a tax of two per centum upon certain sums alleged to have been \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of said Act earned by the defendant from May 1, 1933, to December 31, 1933, and paid to him by the Government of Canada without the said tax having been deducted therefrom.\nBoth defendants were at all material times continuously resident within the province of Manitoba. The defendant Worthington was an officer of the permanent force of the active militia of Canada. The defendant Forbes was a civil servant employed by the Government of Canada in the Department of Agriculture. The sums in respect of which the tax was sought to be recovered were alleged by plaintiff to have been respectively earned by each defendant as such officer and as such civil servant respectively.\nThe defendants each denied any liability to pay the said tax.\nThe defendant Worthington claimed (inter alia) that his presence in Manitoba was solely in performance of his duties as an officer as aforesaid, and according to the duties and exigencies of his service to the King; that any sums in question in fact received by him were received by him from the King pursuant to royal warrant for the payment thereof, under sign manual of the Governor General of Canada, as the King\u2019s representative, from and out of moneys appropriated to His Majesty for the upkeep of His forces in Canada and in accordance with rates laid down by pay and allowance regulations for the militia of Canada; that in so far as the Act in question assumes or purports to declare such sums to be \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of the Act and purports to tax the defendant upon said sums, it is ultra vires because: the taxes provided to be levied and collected under Part I of the Act are indirect taxation; the Act attempts to legislate in respect of the status, privileges and prerogatives of His Majesty the King as Commander in Chief of the militia of Canada and of the authority thereover exercised by His Excellency the Governor General of Canada as His Majesty\u2019s representative in that behalf; by various (specified) provisions of the Act the legislature has sought to impose certain duties and obligations and penalties on His Majesty and His said representative; by the Act the legislature attempts to interfere with and legislate in respect of the relationship between His Majesty the King and the officers and men of His militia in Canada; by Imperial and Dominion legislation and regulations, in force in Canada, it is provided that the pay of any officer or soldier shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorized by The Army Act (Imperial) or any other Act to be enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain, or by any royal warrant for the time being. The defendant claimed that if Part I of the Act were construed as applicable to him it was ultra vires; and alternatively claimed that the sums alleged to have been received by him included the value of allowances for lodging, fuel and fight, which sums were in fact never received by him, and that the provisions of the Act empowering the administrator to determine the monetary value of any such allowances were ultra vires, and constituted indirect taxation and taxation of property held by the King in right of the Dominion of Canada; that, should it be held that the Act was competently enacted, the King is not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the Act.\nThe defendant Forbes claimed (inter alia) that he was not a person who would be liable to any such taxation; that he was not an employee as defined in the Act; that he had not received any moneys upon which any taxation could be levied by the provincial legislature; that the provincial legislature could not pass legislation intercepting or attempting to intercept moneys in the hands, of the Dominion; that the statute is ultra vires, as providing for indirect taxation, and otherwise.\nIn the Court of Appeal, in the Worthington case, Dennistoun and Robson, JJ.A., dissented from the judgment of the Court dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal; in the Forbes case, the Court was unanimous in dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal.\nIn each case special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nH. Phillipps, K.C. for the appellant Worthington.\nC. E. Finkelstein for the appellant Forbes.\nI. Pitblado K.C. and W. E. McLean for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014I agree entirely with the judgment of Mr. Justice Davis.\nI must confess, I have never had any doubt upon the question raised by these appeals touching the construction and effect of the British North America Act. The legislative authority of the provinces, with respect to direct taxation within a province, does, admittedly, embrace the power to levy taxes upon the residents of the province in respect of their incomes; and it would seem to be axiomatic that a resident of the province is none the less so because he is an official, or an employee, or a servant, of the Dominion Government or Parliament, or a person in receipt of emoluments from that Government or Parliament.\nIn Abbott v. City of Saint John[2] it was held that there is nothing in the statute which exempts such persons, or the salaries, wages or emoluments received by such persons, from the jurisdiction of the provinces in relation to the subject of taxation. In that case, this Court had to consider the judgment of the very able judges who decided Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[3]; and it may be worth while to devote a sentence or two to Leprohon\u2019s case3.\nThe trial judge was Mr. Justice Moss[4] (afterwards Chief Justice of Ontario). He proceeded upon principles which had been laid down in judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States, notably in the judgment of Marshall C. J. in McCulloch v. Maryland[5], the effect of which may be summed up in these words, quoted by Moss J.[6] from the judgment of Nelson J. in Buffington v. Day[7]:\n* * * there is no express constitutional prohibition upon the States against taxing the means or instrumentalities of the General Government; but it was held, and we agree properly held, to be prohibited by necessary implication, otherwise States might impose taxation to an extent that would impair, if not wholly defeat, the operations of the Federal authorities when acting in their appropriate sphere.\nMr. Justice Moss himself proceeds:\nIn this case the Central authority, in the exercise of its appropriate functions, appointed the plaintiff to a position of emolument. In the exercise of its proper powers it assigned to him a certain emolument. This emolument the plaintiff is entitled to receive for the discharge of duties for which the Central Government is bound to provide. I do not find in the British North America Act that there is any express constitutional prohibition against the Local Legislatures taxing such a salary, but I think that upon the principles thus summarized in the case which I have just cited there is necessarily an implication that such power is not vested in the Local Legislature.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal for Ontario base their conclusions upon the same grounds.\nIn Abbott v. City of Saint John[8], four of the five judges of this Court were clearly of the view that this reasoning was not admissible for the purpose of determining the limits of the powers vested in the provinces by the British North America Act. Davies J. said (at p. 606):\nTime and again the Judicial Committee have declined to give effect to this anticipatory argument or to assume to refuse to declare a power existed in the legislature of the province simply because its improvident exercise might bring it into conflict with an existing power of the Dominion.\nAt page 618, I observed,\n* * * Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa[9] * * * was decided in 1877. Judicial opinion upon the construction of the British North America Act has swept a rather wide arc since that date; to mention a single instance only, it would not be a light task to reconcile the views upon which Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa9 proceeded with the views expressed by the Judicial Committee in the later case of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[10]. Indeed, although Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa9 has not been expressly over-ruled, the grounds of it have been so thoroughly undermined by subsequent decisions of the Judicial Committee, that it can,\u2014I speak, of course, with the highest respect for the eminent judges who took part in it,\u2014no longer afford a guide to the interpretation of the British North America Act. Abbott v. City of Saint John[11] was approved in Caron v. The King[12] and both decisions are, of course, binding upon this Court.\nIn view of an argument addressed to us, one may, perhaps, observe that Abbott v. City of Saint John11 was not founded on the decision of the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim[13], a decision upon the Commonwealth Act of Australia. It proceeded, as plainly appears from the judgments, upon the view that the reasoning in Leprohon\u2019s case[14] had been swept away by subsequent decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the British North America Act.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Davis that the provisions of sections 4, 5 and 6 and the last clause of section 7 are concerned with the collection and the recovery of the taxes imposed upon the employee by sections 3 and 7.\nIt is conceivable, no doubt, that a province might, while professing to act under clause 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act, attempt to invade the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under clause 8 of section 91 in respect of the\nfixing of * * * the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\nAttempts on the part of both the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces to employ their admitted powers for the purpose of legislating in a field from which they are excluded by the terms of the British North America Act have sometimes come before the courts. One of the most recent cases of the kind concerned an attempt on the part of the Dominion to make use of its powers in respect of taxation in order to exercise legislative control over a subject withdrawn from its jurisdiction by the British North America Act. The attempt failed for the reasons given by Lord Dunedin, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in In re the Insurance Act of Canada[15].\nIf a province should attempt to employ its authority in respect of taxation for the purpose of invading the field of jurisdiction marked out and exclusively appropriated to the Dominion by clause 8 of section 91, then such an attempt must necessarily fail. But there is in truth no reason for imputing such a character to the legislation now before us. The statute, no doubt, specifically mentions wages earned by employees of His Majesty in the right of the Dominion or in right of any province of Canada, but there is no suggestion that there is any discrimination between such employees who are subject to the tax created by this statute. Nor could there be any ground for a suggestion, nor, indeed, does anybody suggest, that the purpose of this statute is anything other than that which is expressed in section 3 (1), viz., the levying of a tax for the purpose of raising a provincial revenue.\nCounsel for the appellant emphasized sections 4, 5 and 6 and the second branch of section 7. The argument, if I understood it, appeared to be that these sections are ultra vires because they constitute an attempt to impose duties upon the Crown, or the officers of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, or of provinces of Canada other than Manitoba, with respect to the disposal of the revenues of the Crown in such rights; that these provisions are inextricably connected with those of sections 3 and 7, and that the whole of the series of enactments beginning with section 3 and ending with section 7 form a unum quid which is struck with invalidity because of the legislature\u2019s illegal assumption of authority in enacting sections 4, 5 and 6 and the second part of section 7.\nThere are, as I conceive, three conclusive answers to this contention. First of all, assuming everything in sections 4, 5 and 6 and the second branch of section 7 which imposes any duty or liability upon the employer to be struck from the statute as ultra vires, there would still stand enactments valid and complete for the purpose of making the taxes in question exigible from the taxpayer. I shall elaborate this later.\nSecond, the impeached enactments (sections 4, 5 and 6, and the second part of section 7), read by the light of well settled and well known canons of construction, do not, as it appears to me, extend to the Crown or to the officers of the Crown in the right of the Dominion or of any province of the Dominion, other, at all events, than Manitoba, or to the revenues of the Crown in these respective rights; and further, even if this were not so, the form and character of the legislation is such that the enactments, in so far as they relate to such governments and such revenues, must be treated as severable, and that the enactments would still have their full operation as regards other employers and other revenues.\nThirdly, section 11 of The Manitoba Interpretation Act (ch. 105, R.S.M. 1913) precludes the extension of sections 4, 5 and 6 and the second part of section 7 at least to the Crown in right of the Dominion or in right of any province other than Manitoba.\nReading sections 4, 5 and 6 without reference to the interpretation clauses, but in light of accepted rules of construction, it is clear that these sections must be construed as imposing duties and liabilities only upon employers within the territorial jurisdiction of the Legislature of Manitoba, and as dealing with moneys or revenues having a situs which would enable the Legislature to exercise control over them. The general rule, I think, is stated with perfect accuracy in the treatise on Statutes in Lord Halsbury\u2019s collection, Vol. 27, section 310, at p. 163,\nWhen Parliament uses general words it is dealing only with persons or things over which it has properly jurisdiction; it would be futile to presume to exercise a jurisdiction which it could not enforce.\nThe presumption in favour of this general rule is fortified in this case by the penal provisions of section 6, which become operative in any case in which an employer fails to observe the duty created by sections 4 and 5 to collect and pay over any tax, imposed by Part 1, that is to say, by sections 3 and 7. Such penal provisions, expressed in general terms, ought not to be construed so as to bring within their sweep employers who are neither domiciled nor resident in Manitoba and whose moneys, out of which the wages are paid, are in their possession beyond the limits of that province, nor to acts or defaults of such employers committed outside the province (MacLeod v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[16]). Since subsection 1 of section 6 applies to all employers who fail to collect and pay over taxes under the provisions of Part 1, and subsection 2 applies to everybody who contravenes any provision of Part 1, this is solid ground for the inference that the duties imposed by sections 4 and 5, in respect of which section 6 provides the sanctions, are duties which the statute contemplates shall be performed in the province. The last sentence of the first paragraph of section 4 ought not to be overlooked. It professes to provide for a discharge pro tanto of the obligation of the employer to pay the wages of the employee in the manner prescribed, that is to say, by payment of the tax to the province. Now the obligation of the employer would, as a rule, being a simple contract debt, have its situs at the residence of the employer; and the legislature of the province would be impotent to regulate the conditions of its discharge when the employer\u2019s residence is not in the province (Royal Bank of Canada v. The King[17]). This observation applies equally to subsection 3 of section 4.\nThis construction of sections 4, 5 and 6 receives powerful support by reference to the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in clause (c) of section 2 (1). It is in these words:\n2 (1) (c) \u201cEmployer\u201d includes every person, manager, or representative having control or direction of or responsible, directly or indirectly, for the wages of any employee, and in case the employer resides outside the province, the person in control within the province shall be deemed to be the employer;\nThe Legislature seems to have recognized that the enactments of Part 1, imposing duties upon employers and penalties for failing to perform them, could not be operative in respect of employers and their acts and property outside of the province. The last part of section 7 is not without its significance. It, by reference, makes the procedure established by sections 23, 23A and 24 of the Income Tax Act (C.A. 1924, ch. 91, as amended) available for the collection and recovery of the tax. They are made available for recovery and collection, not only from the taxpayer, the person on whom the tax is imposed, but, as well, for the enforcement of payment by the employer pursuant to the obligation created by section 4. Now, it is obvious from inspection that these sections of the Income Tax Act are only intended to apply to employers having goods in Manitoba susceptible to distress.\nThe provision upon which the argument of the appellant largely rests is that of section 2 (1) (d) (ii), which is in these words:\n(ii) the salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration of members of the Senate and House of Commons of the Dominion and officers thereof, members of the Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies, members of municipal councils, commissions, or boards of management, and of any judge of any Dominion or provincial court, and of all persons whatsoever, whether such salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any province thereof, or any person;\nThe argument, as I understand it, proceeds thus: Where the word \u201cwages\u201d occurs in sections 4, 5 and 6, you must substitute therefor the explanatory phrases of the interpretation section. Now, in the first place, it is important to observe that under this interpretation section, these explanatory clauses only apply \u201cwhere the context does not otherwise require\u201d (sec. 2 (1)). I should have thought it reasonably clear, in view of the considerations I have mentioned, and especially in view of section 2 (1) (c), that the definition in section 2 (1) (d) (ii) could not properly be applied in such a way as to give to sections 4 and 5 the scope necessary to make them applicable to the payment of wages by, for example, a provincial government, other than that of Manitoba, or to an employee of that government. It is unnecessary to discuss the effect of the words \u201cresident\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d as applied to the Crown. The general principle of construction to which I have referred would, I should have thought, obviously have excluded from the scope of the general words of sections 4, 5 and 6 wages payable by the Crown in the right of another province and, necessarily, out of the revenue of that province and by authority of legislative appropriation or statute. Every consideration in favour of the rule which restricts the operation of the general words of a provincial statute, in such a way as to exclude from them property situate outside the territorial jurisdiction of the legislature and persons and the acts of persons outside that jurisdiction, applies with greatly multiplied force in favour of the view that these sections ought not to be construed as extending to the officials of the government of another province, or to the acts of such officials in dealing with the assets and revenues of the province. A fortiori, they ought not to be construed as attempting to impose legal obligations and duties on the Crown in the right of the Dominion, or the officials of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, or as assuming to direct under penal sanctions the disposition of the revenues of the Dominion. No court ought, it seems to me, to attribute to the legislature of a province an intention to enact legislation so obviously beyond the scope of its legitimate action in absence of almost intractable words.\nAgain, subsection 3 of section 4 provides that the amount of the tax, after having been deducted and retained by the employer, shall be held in trust for His Majesty in the right of the province. This seems to be an illuminating provision. The term employer, must, as we have seen, receive some qualification. What is the qualification here? In the first place, the moneys deducted would in most cases where payable by the Dominion, or a provincial government, not have a situs in Manitoba, and that alone is sufficient for excluding such governments from the scope of the term. But beyond that, is it conceivable that a legislature of a province of Canada would assume to declare the Dominion Government or another provincial government a trustee of its revenues for that province? We cannot, I think, in the absence of some plain words, impute such an intention to the legislature.\nThen, there is a special observation as regards section 5, By that section, the employer is required to keep \u201cat some place in the province\u201d a list of his employees with their residences. Obviously, such a provision is inoperative in relation to employers not domiciled or resident in the province. Plainly here effect must be given to the presumption excluding persons outside the jurisdiction of the legislature.\nI now turn to the effect of section 11 of The Manitoba Interpretation Act (R.S.M. 1913, ch. 105) which contains this provision:\nNo provisions or enactment in any Act shall affect in any manner or way whatsoever the rights of His Majesty, His heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that His Majesty shall be bound thereby; * * *\nBy section 2 of the Act, there are certain cases in which section 11 does not; apply. These cases are where that section,\n(a) is inconsistent with the intent and object of any such Act, or (b) would give to any word, expression or clause of any such Act an interpretation inconsistent with the context, or (c) is in any such Act declared not applicable thereto. There is nothing in the statute before us which declares section 11 to be inapplicable thereto, nor, in view of what I have said, can it, I think, be affirmed that section 11 is in any way inconsistent with the intent and object of the statute.\nCan it be said then that section 11, if given effect to, \u201cwould give to any word, expression or clause\u201d of the statute \u201can interpretation inconsistent with the context?\u201d There is nothing in the context which is inconsistent with section 11 unless it can be discovered in the word \u201cwages,\u201d reading that word by reference to the explanatory clause in the interpretation section 2 (1) (d).\nIt does not appear to be necessary to consider the question whether, by force of section 2, the word \u201cemployer\u201d in these sections (sections 4, 5, 6 and the second part of section 7) should be extended to include His Majesty in right of the province of Manitoba. The statute as a whole is for the behoof of His Majesty in right of that province. On the other hand, the tone of the sections in question (4, 5, 6 and the enactments of the Income Tax Act referentially introduced by the second part of section 7), as well as the substance of some of the provisions of these sections, are not entirely consonant with the idea that they are intended to apply to His Majesty in any capacity.\nIt is, however, unnecessary to pass upon this point. Our concern is with the application of these provisions to His Majesty in right of the Dominion and of the other provinces of Canada. Is His Majesty in these capacities comprehended within the general term \u201cemployer\u201d?\nIn re Silver Brothers, Ltd.[18] contains observations by Lord Dunedin, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, valuable for our present purpose touching the effect of an enactment by the legislature of a province which, if operative, would prejudicially affect the rights of the Crown in relation to its revenues and assets under the control of another legislative jurisdiction in Canada. He says:\nThe next point made was that the provisions of s. 16 do not apply-when what is being done is not to affect the Crown prejudicially, but to give a benefit to the Crown, and along with this it is urged that there is only one Crown, and reference is made to the case of Attorney-General for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Ry. Co.[19]. It is quite true that the section refers to cases where the Crown would be \u201cbound,\u201d i.e., subjected to liability, and not to those where the Crown is benefited. But the fallacy lies in the application of this truth to the case in question. Quoad the Crown in the Dominion of Canada the Special War Revenue Act confers a benefit, but quoad the Crown in the Province of Quebec it proposes to bind the Crown to its disadvantage. It is true that there is only one Crown, but as regards Crown revenues and Crown property by legislation assented to by the Crown there is a distinction made between the revenues and property in the Province and the revenues and property in the Dominion. There are two separate statutory purses. In each the ingathering and expending authority is different.\nI have already called attention to the fact that the legislature in the interpretation clause (s. 2 (1) (c)) seems to recognize the rule of interpretation which presumptively imputes to the legislature an intention of limiting the direct operation of its enactments to persons and things within its jurisdiction. When these sections are examined as a whole, the form, as well as the substance of them, enormously strengthens this presumption. The immediate context, therefore, offers no obstacle whatever to the application of section 11 to them. Indeed, these sections, read by themselves, in the absence of section 11 and in the absence of the interpretation clause, would be applied upon the footing that \u201cemployer\u201d does not include His Majesty in right of the Dominion or of another province. Such being the case, it would appear that effect ought to be given to the introductory words of section 2(1): \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d It results, therefore, from the terms of section 11 of The Manitoba Interpretation Act, applied by the light of the general considerations adverted to above, and of the definition of the term \u201cemployer\u201d in the interpretation section, that that part of clause (ii) of section 2(1) (d) which refers to remuneration\npaid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any province thereof\nought not, by reason of the restriction which must be placed upon the general term \u201cemployer,\u201d to be regarded as governing the interpretation of the term \u201cwages\u201d in these sections.\nApart from these considerations, it would appear that those parts of the definition of \u201cwages\u201d which relate to moneys payable out of revenues of the Dominion are severable from the other parts of the definition. If you excise these references, you do not affect the meaning of the enactments of sections 4, 5 and 6 in their application to other persons. Since the application of these enactments to His Majesty in the right of the Dominion, or His Majesty\u2019s officers, or to the revenues of His Majesty in the right of the Dominion, would be ultra vires, there seems to me no reason why, in treating that part of the statute as null, the validity of these enactments in other respects should be impeachable. In Brooks-Bidlake and Whittal Ltd. v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[20], the Judicial Committee, dealing with the statutory stipulation of a timber licence under the British Columbia Crown Lands Act, which provided that\nthis licence is issued and accepted on the understanding that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith,\nheld that, by reason of the Japanese Treaty Act, 1913, enacted by the Dominion Parliament, the stipulation as regards Japanese was void; but that it must prevail as regards the employment of Chinese. The words of the judgment (at p. 458) are:\nThe stipulation is severable, Chinese and Japanese being separately named; and the condition against employing Chinese labour having been broken, the appellants have no right to renewal.\nThe present case seems clearly to fall within this rule.\nIn Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[21], the Judicial Committee had to deal with a case in which they were obliged to hold that an enactment which was ultra vires in some respects, but which would, in a separate enactment, have been valid in some other respects, must be treated as invalid as a whole, because, in view of the circumstances, it was quite impracticable for a court of law to effect the necessary division. The words of the judgment are,\nIf the statute seeks to impose on the brokers and agents and the miscellaneous group of factors and elevator companies who may fall within its provisions, a tax which is in reality indirect within the definition which has been established, the task of separating out these cases of such persons and corporations from others in which there is a legitimate imposition of direct taxation, is a matter of such complication that it is impracticable for a court of law to make the exhaustive partition required. In other words, if the statute is ultra vires as regards the first class of cases, it has to be pronounced to be ultra vires altogether. Their Lordships agree with Duff J. in his view that if the Act is inoperative as regards brokers, agents and others, it is not possible for any court to presume that the Legislature intended to pass it in what may prove to be a highly truncated form. There can be no doubt, if in substance the severance of part of the legislation which is ultra vires from the statute as a whole would have the effect of \u201ctransforming it into one to which the legislature has not given its assent,\u201d then it would be beyond the province of any court to deal with the matter in that way (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[22]. In view of what has already been said, such an objection would, as it appears to me, in the present case, be groundless.\nAgain, even if one could come to the conclusion that sections 4, 5 and 6 must be treated as inoperative as a whole, sections 3 and 7 are, in themselves, quite sufficient. Section 3 provides:\n3. (1) In addition to all other taxes to which he is liable under this or any other Act, every employee shall pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax of two per centum upon the amount of all wages earned by or accruing due to him on or after the first day of May, 1933, which tax shall be levied and collected at the times and in the manner prescribed by this part;\nIt is the employee on whom it is to be imposed, but the tax is to be \u201ccollected at the times and in the manner prescribed by this part.\u201d Now, it is perfectly clear, as I have already pointed out, especially in view of section 2 (1) (c), that the legislature must have contemplated that sections 4, 5 and 6 would fail of application in many cases; in all cases in which the employer is resident outside of Manitoba, has all his assets and revenues outside of Manitoba, and has no representative in Manitoba who has any control or direction or responsibility in relation to the wages to be taxed. It would be quite inadmissible to hold that in such cases sections 3 and 7 have no application. The rule laid down by Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney-General[23] is this:\nIf the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nThe operation of sections 3 and 7 is not in any way dependent upon sections 4, 5 and 6 or any of them taking effect against the employer. There is no ground for holding that, when the last mentioned sections do not affect the employer, because he and his assets are beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the legislature, the operations of sections 3 and 7 are in any degree impaired. Section 7 plainly includes such a case, which already falls within the words:\nIn case the wages earned or accruing due to an employee are paid to him without the tax imposed thereon being deducted therefrom by his employer, * * *\nAnd in all cases in which the employer is not within the general terms of sections 4, 5 and 6, section 7 equally applies.\nThe tax is imposed by section 3 and the obligation to pay the tax is created by that section and section 7, and which includes by reference section 25 (1) of The Income Tax Act (C.A. 1924, ch. 91, as amended) which, by section 7, applies in all cases within section 3,\nIn addition to all other remedies herein provided, taxes, penalties and costs and unpaid portions thereof assessed or imposed under this Act may be recovered as a debt due to His Majesty from the taxpayer.\nThe appellants have, in my view, presented no answer to the claim of the Crown.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014These appeals were heard together as they raise substantially the same question. The appellant Worthington is an officer of the permanent force of the active militia of Canada, having been duly commissioned under the provisions of the Militia Act of Canada. The appellant Forbes is a civil servant employed by the government of the Dominion of Canada in the Department of Agriculture. Both appellants were at all material times continuously resident within the Province of Manitoba. Both appellants seek to escape from the imposition of an income tax upon them by the Province of Manitoba. While several grounds of escape were urged upon us by counsel for the appellants, the main contention was that the Province had no right to impose an income tax upon members of the permanent force of the Canadian militia or upon Dominion civil servants, as such imposition of income tax would result in diminution of the pay or salary of such persons and constitute interference with the conduct of the Federal Government in matters of militia and of the civil service of the Dominion. These two actions were brought as test cases and we have had the benefit of full and helpful argument by counsel in the appeals.\nApart from the special considerations that may apply to persons holding office or employment in the two classifications with which we are specially concerned in these appeals, there can be no doubt of the general proposition that every province has a right to raise revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation within the province. That power was very clearly given to the provinces by sec. 92, sub-head (2), of the British North America Act.\nTurning then to the special legislation with which we are concerned, the Province of Manitoba has what may be called a general income tax, imposed under the provisions of The Income Tax Act, being ch. 91 of the Manitoba Statutes Consolidation of 1924 with subsequent amendments. By sec. 8 of that statute there shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person:\u2014\n(a) residing or ordinarily resident in Manitoba; or\n(b) who remains in Manitoba during any calendar year for a period or periods equal to one hundred and eighty-three days;\n(c) who is employed in Manitoba during such year;\n(d) who not being resident in Manitoba is carrying on business in Manitoba during such year;\n(e) who not being resident in Manitoba derives income for services rendered in Manitoba during such year otherwise than in the course of regular or continuous employment for any person resident or carrying on business in Manitoba;\na tax at the rates applicable to persons other than corporations and joint stock companies set forth in the first schedule of this Act upon the amount of income in excess of the exemptions provided in this Act; provided that the said rates shall not apply to corporations and joint stock companies, but shall apply to income of personal corporations, as provided for in 8B of this Act. (1931, c. 25, s. 11).\nIn addition to the taxes provided by the schedule there shall be assessed, levied and paid a tax of five per cent., on the tax payable by persons with an income of five thousand dollars or over, before any allowance is made for deductions and exemptions. (1932, c. 49, s. 8).\nBy the interpretation section of the statute (sec. 2 (j)) \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is defined to mean\nany person paying, liable to pay, or believed by the Minister to be liable to pay, any tax imposed by this Act.\nFor the purpose of the statute an extended meaning is given to the word \u201cincome\u201d by sec. 3 and the word is used as\nincluding the salaries, indemnities or other remuneration of all persons whatsoever whether the said salaries, indemnities or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in respect of His government of Canada or of any province thereof, or by any person, and all other gains or profits of any land derived from any source within or without the province whether received in money or its equivalent, with the exemptions and deductions hereinafter respectively set out.\nA long list of detailed exemptions and deductions from taxation under the Act is provided by sees. 4 and 5, with none of which exemptions or deductions we are specially concerned in these appeals. Sections 23A, 24 and 25 of the statute deal with the collection and enforcement of the tax. It may be observed in passing that sec. 25 (1) provides that,\nIn addition to all other remedies herein provided, taxes, penalties and costs and unpaid portions thereof assessed or imposed under this Act may be recovered as a debt due to His Majesty from the taxpayer.\nIn 1933 the Province of Manitoba passed an Act to impose a special tax on incomes. This Act is known as The Special Income Tax Act, and it is with this statute that we are particularly concerned. It is divided into two main parts. Part I is headed \u201cTaxation of Wages\u201d and Part II is headed \u201cTaxation of Income other than Wages.\u201d The question before us falls to be determined mainly under Part I of this statute, it being admitted that the tax sought to be collected from each of the appellants has been imposed under Part I of the statute. To fully understand and appreciate the nature and scope of the taxation under Part I, it is necessary to study the provisions of Part II as well as the provisions of the general income tax Act above mentioned, being The Income Tax Act of 1924 with amendments.\nPart II of The Special Income Tax Act imposes (sec 8 (1)) upon every person other than a corporation an annual tax of two per centum upon the value of his taxable income, other than wages as to which a tax has been paid under Part I, and such tax shall be ascertained and collected in accordance with the provisions of this part. By sec. 8 (2) the tax imposed by this part shall apply in respect of all taxpayers, other than corporations, within the scope of The Income Tax Act, or who would be within the scope of that Act if no deductions or exemptions were allowed therein. I have set out above the definition of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in the general Act. The Special Income Tax Act having been assented to on May 4, 1933, it was provided by sec. 9 that the tax imposed by Part II for the year 1933 should be based on the income of the taxpayer for the year 1932 and the tax for each year thereafter on the income for the previous year; and by sec. 12 (2) the tax imposed on a taxpayer by Part II shall be assessed and levied and payable annually at the same times as the annual income tax under The Income Tax Act is assessed, levied and made payable. The legislature of Manitoba, faced with the obvious delay in raising revenue under Part II of the special Act on the basis of an annual assessment, adopted for practical expediency a method of taxation whereby revenue would be raised at once in monthly payments on the basis of a tax of two per centum upon the amount of all wages earned or accruing due on or after the first day of May, 1933. This monthly assessment and collection of the taxes on wages was undoubtedly adopted as a matter of practical expediency to produce revenue at once without awaiting an annual payment on the basis of the provisions of Part II of the Act. It is to be recalled that by sec. 8 (1) of Part II the annual tax of two per centum upon the value of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income excludes \u201cwages as to which a tax has been paid under Part I.\u201d Now in Part I it is provided, sec. 3 (1), that in addition to all other taxes to which he is liable under this or any other Act, every employee shall pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax of two per centum upon the amount of all wages earned by or accruing due to him on or after the first day of May, 1933, which tax shall be levied and collected at the times and in the manner prescribed by this part. \u201cEmployee\u201d by sec. 2 (1) (b) \u201cmeans any person who is in receipt of or entitled to any wages\u201d; and \u201cwages\u201d by sec. 2 (1) (d),\nincludes all wages, salaries, and emoluments from any source whatsoever, including\n(i) any compensation for labour or services, measured by the time, piece, or otherwise;\n(ii) the salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration of members of the Senate and House of Commons of the Dominion and officers thereof, members of the Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies, members of municipal councils, commissions, or boards of management, and of any judge of any Dominion or provincial court and of all persons whatsoever, whether such salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any province thereof, or any person;\n(iii) personal and living expenses and subsistence when they form part of the profit or remuneration of the employee; and\n(iv) emoluments, perquisites, or privileges incidental to the office or employment of the employee which are reducible to a money value. It was argued that sec. 4 under part I indicates that the tax in substance is on the employer\u2019s payroll rather than on the employee and that the tax is therefore indirect and beyond the power of the province to impose. Sec. 4 is as follows:\n4. (1) Every employer at the time of payment of wages to an employee shall levy and collect the tax imposed on the employee by this part in respect of the wages of the employee earned or accruing due during the period covered by the payment, and shall deduct and retain the amount of the tax from the wages payable to the employee, and shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month next following that in which the payment of wages takes place, or at such other time as the regulations prescribe, pay to the administrator the full amount of the tax. No employee shall have any right of action against his employer in respect of any moneys deducted from his wages and paid over to the administrator by the employer in compliance or intended compliance with this section.\n(2) Every employer shall, with each payment made by him to the administrator under this section, furnish to the administrator a return showing all taxes imposed by this part on the employees of the employer in respect of wages during the period covered by the return, which shall be in the form and verified in the manner prescribed by the administrator.\n(3) Every employer who deducts or retains the amount of any tax under this part from the wages of his employee shall be deemed to hold the same in trust for His Majesty and for the payment over of the same in the manner and at the time provided under this part.\nSec. 4 is the machinery set up for the collection of the tax. For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of parts I and II of The Special Income Tax Act, it is provided by sec. 16 thereof that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may make regulations governing the administration of the Act and that such regulations shall have the force of law as if made part of the Act. Turning to the regulations made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council we find the following:\n3. If an employer be satisfied that the total wages of an employee during a period of twelve months will not exceed a sum which entitled the employee to exemption under this Act, the employer shall not be obliged to collect or remit the tax. He shall, nevertheless, show the total amount paid such employee.\n4. An employer shall not be liable to collect a tax from a person casually and not regularly employed where in any case he is satisfied that the wages of the employee during the period of twelve months will not exceed a sum which entitled the employee to exemption under this Act.\n6. Every employer who levies and collects any tax imposed under said Act with respect to wages of any employee shall, as remuneration for his collection and payment thereof to the Provincial Treasurer, be entitled to deduct from the amount so paid two per centum of such payments and in no case shall such deduction be less than ten cents. There is nothing to justify the contention of the appellants that the taxation of wages under the statute is in substance an indirect tax on the employer\u2019s payroll. Sec. 3 of Part I above set out is the charging section and as Lord Thankerton said in Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr[24],\nThe identification of the subject-matter of the tax is naturally to be found in the charging section of the statute, and it will only be in the case of some ambiguity in the terms of the charging section that recourse to other sections is proper or necessary.\nSec 7 of Part I provides that in case the wages earned or accruing due to an employee are paid to him without the tax imposed thereon being deducted therefrom by his employer, it shall be the duty of the employee to forthwith pay the tax. That section does not impose a liability upon the employer for the tax. Sec. 6 (1) provides that, if an employer in violation of the provisions of Part I fails to collect and pay over any tax imposed by Part I, the administrator of the Act may demand and collect from him, that is the employer, as a penalty ten per cent. of the tax payable and in addition the employer is liable to a fine. Sec. 6 (2) draws the distinction between the tax payable and moneys in the hands of an employer.\nNothing contained in this section nor the enforcement of any penalty thereunder shall suspend or affect any remedy for the recovery of any tax payable under this part or of any moneys in the hands of an employer belonging to His Majesty.\nThe somewhat inapt language used in sec. 7, that\nall the provisions of sections 23, 23A, 24 and 25 of \u201cThe Income Tax Act\u201d shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the collection and recovery of the tax so imposed from the employer and employee, or either of them.\ncannot be read, having regard to the statute taken as a whole, as imposing the tax upon the employer. The collection and recovery of the tax, and not its imposition, is the substance of the language used.\nThe imposition of the tax upon the employee is clearly made in the charging section (sec. 3 (1)) and secs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 do not attempt to impose the tax as such upon the employer but merely provide for the collection of the tax by the employer, and in respect of which collection the employer is entitled, under regulation 6 above set out, to remuneration to the extent of two per centum of the amount collected and paid over by him to the Provincial Treasurer. The collection and recovery provisions are clearly within the competence of the provincial legislature.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the imposition of the tax on wages under Part I of the statute is direct taxation to raise revenue for provincial purposes within the province and valid under sec. 92, sub-head (2), of the British North America Act.\nThe appellant Worthington, an officer of the permanent force of the active militia of Canada, contends through his counsel, firstly, that the pay of a soldier is a gratuity from the Crown and cannot in any sense be regarded as wages, and secondly, that in any case a soldier is immune from income taxation by provincial governments, as such taxation involves a diminution in the pay and allowance of the soldier and constitutes an interference with national defence and is beyond the competence of any province. The Militia Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 132, sec. 48, provides in part as follows:\n(1) Officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Force shall be entitled to daily pay and allowances at rates to be prescribed,\nand the Regulations issued pursuant to the Militia Act, called Pay and Allowance Regulations, state (No. 43):\nIn compliance with section 8 of the Militia Pension Act, a deduction of 5 per cent. will be made from the pay of every officer and warrant officer, and this will be calculated on his total emoluments, including the amounts granted for lodging, fuel, light, rations, and servant, as set forth in article 74, notwithstanding that he may be provided with these in kind instead of in money, but excluding any married allowance or allowances for forage, travelling or transfer.\nThe word \u201cemoluments\u201d is used. The word \u201cwages\u201d in The Special Income Tax Act is defined (sec. 2 (1) (d) as above set out) to include \u201call wages, salaries, and emoluments from any source whatsoever,\u201d and the definition is sufficiently wide to cover the pay and allowance of an officer in the militia. As to the second point, that this taxation by the province is unconstitutional as causing a diminution in the soldier\u2019s pay and interfering with national defence, the statute imposes a provincial tax of general application and cannot be construed as legislation respecting the salaries of soldiers as such. It is taxation aimed at citizens at large and there is no ground, in the absence of express provision, to protect the military man from the incidence of the general tax. It is a tax upon persons within the province who are receiving wages within the broad definition of that word as used in the statute and the amount of the tax (2 per cent.) is not such as can be said to constitute any interference with the federal government in relation to its soldiers. The British North America Act has made two broad divisions in the distribution of legislative power, one Dominion and the other Provincial. Within these two divisions the different legislatures possess their own legislative jurisdiction. To the provinces have been given generally all matters of local municipal government. The execution of certain prescribed duties of a local character are entrusted to the provinces in relation to education, the establishment, maintenance and management of public and reformatory prisons, hospitals and asylums in and for the province, the administration of justice, municipal institutions, local works and undertakings, property and civil rights, and generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. These public services entail enormous expenditures of money by the provinces, and when a general levy upon all its citizens is imposed by a province for the purpose of raising revenue by direct taxation within the province, it does not create any conflict between federal and provincial authority such as to entitle a military officer who actually resides in the province to escape from the incidence of the purely local taxation. There is nothing in the legislation directed against the salary of the military officer as such and he must, like all other good citizens, carry his burden of the local taxation of the province within which he resides.\nThis Court in Abbott v. City of Saint John[25] held that notwithstanding No. 8 of section 91, which provides that the Dominion Parliament shall have exclusive legislative authority over the fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the government of Canada, a civil or other officer of the government of Canada may be lawfully taxed in respect of his income, as such, by the municipality in which he resides, under the authority of provincial legislation. The principle of that case applies to the facts of this appeal and is clearly binding upon us.\nThe appellant in the other case, Forbes, who is a Dominion civil servant, stands in no different position from that of the appellant Worthington.\nBoth appeals should be dismissed, but under the circumstances without costs.\nCannon J. (dissenting) delivered the following judgment in the Forbes appeal:\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014In support of the competency of the provincial legislature to impose this 2 per cent. tax under The Special Income Tax Act upon the salary or wages of a Dominion civil servant who is within the province in the same manner as it is imposed upon all other persons of the province, the respondent invokes the decision in Abbott v. City of Saint John[26], which was applied in City of Toronto v. Morson[27], and approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Caron v. The King[28]. In this last case, their Lordships could see no reason in principle why any of the sources of income of a taxable citizen should be removed from the power of taxation of the Parliament of Canada. They also referred with approval to the judgment of Sir Louis Davies, J., in Abbott v. City of Saint John[29] as follows:\nHe was dealing with the imposition of tax by the Province upon a Dominion official, which imposition, it was contended, contravened the provisions of head 8 of s. 91, a provision which gives to the Dominion \u201cthe fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\u201d He said: \u201cThe Province does not attempt to interfere directly with the exercise of the Dominion power, but merely says that, when exercised, the recipients of the salaries shall be amenable to provincial legislation in like manner as all other residents. * * * It is said,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe Legislature might authorize an income tax denuding a Dominion official of a tenth or even a fifth of his official income, and, in this way, paralyze the Dominion service and impair the efficiency of the service. But it must be borne in mind that the law does not provide for a special tax on Dominion officials but for a general undiscriminatory tax upon the incomes of residents and that Dominion officials could only be taxed upon their incomes in the same ratio and proportion as other residents. At any rate, if, under the guise of exercising power of taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other salaries were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question and not to assume beforehand such a suggested misuse of the power.\u201d\nMoreover, the Privy Council considered that the Dominion Income Tax Acts were not discriminating statutes. They were statutes for imposing on all citizens contributions according to their annual means regardless of, or, it may be said, not having regard to the source from which their annual means are derived. The appellant says:\nThat case is clearly distinguishable from the one at bar for there the Court was dealing with a general income tax statute and held that a Dominion Government Official\u2019s salary should be included in computing his general income but that case was not one of a statute placing a tax upon his salary but was merely a general income statute.\nI\nAre Dominion civil servants entitled to retain the full salary which the Legislature of Manitoba is attempting to reduce by a tax as \u201cwages\u201d earned and paid within the province?\nWithout discussing, for the moment, whether or not the statute under consideration imposes a direct or indirect tax, it might be advisable to ascertain what is the meaning of the word \u201ctaxation\u201d used in sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. A tax is an enforced contribution in money levied on persons, property or income by the proper authority for the support of government. The province is empowered to make laws in relation to direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. This is evidently confined to the levying of money and this taxation must be imposed equally on all citizens. No one is supposed to be conscripted into the public service under the guise of taxation. Can there be equality of taxation as between the ordinary citizen enjoying all the civil rights and liberties and privileges of free agents and a person living in the province who is in the service of the federal government? Does the civil servant enjoy the same liberties as the other subjects in the province? Has he the same rights to freedom of speech and discussion at public meetings? and especially, does he enjoy the right to strike or the right to withhold his labour, so long as he commits no breach of contract or tort or crime? See Halsbury, Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Vo. Constitutional Law, No. 437\u2014pages 391-392. Can he, at will, leave the province to earn his living elsewhere? Has he, like other citizens, absolute freedom to use as he intends his working power or his earning capacity? In other words, is he, as far as his wages are concerned, to be considered as a free agent who can refuse to work?\nThe Civil Service Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 22) contains these provisions:\n44. The Commission shall by regulation prescribe working hours for each portion of the civil service, and there shall be kept and used in each branch of the civil service a book, system or device approved by the Commission for preserving a record of the attendance of the employees.\n46. The deputy head may grant to each officer, clerk or other employee a yearly leave of absence for a period not exceeding eighteen days in any one fiscal year, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, after they have been at least one year in the service.\n2. Every such officer, clerk or employee shall take the leave so granted at such time each year as the deputy head determines.\n55. No deputy head, officer, clerk or employee in the civil service shall be debarred from voting at any Dominion or provincial election if, under the laws governing the said election, he has the right to vote; but no such deputy head, officer, clerk or employee shall engage in partisan work in connection with any such election, or contribute, receive or in any way deal with any money for any party funds.\n2. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be dismissed from the civil service.\nMoreover, any permanent or temporary employment in the service of the Government of Canada disqualifies the holder thereof as a candidate to a seat in Parliament. See also article 160 of the Criminal Code\u2014imposing special criminal liability on civil servants.\nThis means that the civil servant must give and is considered as having dedicated all his activities and work to the State and is entitled to receive in return the compensation fixed for the class in the civil service to which he belongs.\nHis activities are even restricted during his vacation or outside of his office hours. This appears clearly by the following Orders in Council:\n(a) P.C. 1802, of the 7th day of August, 1931, which enacts that\nWhere any employee is known to be using any of his annual leave for the purpose of engaging in temporary employment in connection with the operation of any race track, exhibition, or in the selling of goods of any kind, thereby depriving wholly unemployed people of such temporary work, he shall, on the production of evidence proving the said offence to the satisfaction of the Deputy Head, be subject to immediate suspension, investigation and appropriate discipline, except in cases where, for sufficient cause shown, the Minister of Labour shall have granted special permission authorizing such temporary employment.\n(b) P.C. 95, of the 16th day of January, 1932:\nWhereas section 2 of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, chapter 24 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, provides that:\n\u201cCivil servant\u201d means and includes any permanent officer, clerk or employee in the Civil Service as herein defined,\n(i) who is in receipt of a stated annual salary of at least six hundred dollars; and\n(ii) who is required, during the hours or period of his active employment, to devote his constant attention to the performance of the duties of his position and the conditions of whose employment for the period or periods of the year over which such employment extends precludes his engaging in any other substantially gainful service or occupation.\nAnd whereas the Secretary of State of Canada reports that \u201ccivil servants\u201d within the meaning of the said Act have heretofore been accustomed to become candidates in municipal and civic elections, and thereafter, if elected, to accept municipal and civic offices, or to engage in other substantially gainful services and occupations, which preclude such civil servants from devoting their constant attention to the performance of the duties of their respective positions in the Civil Service of Canada;\nNow therefore His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada, is pleased to order and it is hereby ordered that anyone, who may now be or hereafter may become a civil servant within the meaning and intent of said Act, shall hereafter be precluded from becoming a candidate at any municipal or civic election, or from engaging in any other substantially gainful service or occupation, without first having obtained leave of absence, without pay, from his duties as such civil servant for the term of the municipal or civic office which he proposes to accept or for the period or periods of the year over which it is proposed that such other gainful service or occupation shall extend.\nwhich was amended by\n(c) P.C. 2463, of the 7th day of November, 1932, as follows:\nProvided always that the Minister administering or in charge of any Department may, in his discretion, grant permission to any of his officers, clerks or employees, to accept a municipal or civic office which does not carry with it a salary, honorarium or other emolument exceeding five hundred dollars per annum, if, in the opinion of the Minister, the acceptance of such office does not interfere with the proper and regular performance of his duties as a civil servant.\nIt therefore appears abundantly that the federal civil servant is bound by law to render his service exclusively to the State. Contrary to the ordinary citizen, he is\u2014towards the Government, in the public interest\u2014in a state of servitude. He has accepted this \u201ccapitis diminutio\u201d for an indemnity fixed by Parliament. II\nSince the Abbott case[30], new elements have appeared in this constitutional problem. Parliament has imposed on federal employees the War Time Income Tax. It has even introduced the dangerous practice\u2014which has found ready imitators\u2014of disregarding the respectable principle of the sanctity of contracts by reducing by 10 per cent. the salaries by the unilateral action of one of the contracting parties claiming inability to pay.\nNow, what is the position of a civil servant when a proportion of his salary is taken away by provincial legislation? Towards the State, he is not, and cannot be, in the same position as the ordinary taxpayer who is required to contribute his share in money for public purposes. The civil servant, if subject to this taxation, is required to contribute the same quota in money plus his services which must nevertheless be given to the nation gratuitously in the proportion of the deduction made from his salary by the impost. In this case, he would be bound by provincial legislation to give 100 per cent. services for 98 per cent. indemnity. I see nothing in the British North America Act, either insection 91 or 92, empowering any provincial government to compel any citizen to give gratuitously, in whole or in part, his services to the central government and to the public. Taxation under the British North America Act must be in money and not in money plus services.\nNow in this case the effect of taxation on men bound to give all their working hours to the public is to discriminate against them by imposing a levy of money plus 2 per cent. of their services as a gratuitous extra contribution to the nation more than what the other citizens of the Province are called upon to contribute\u2014for local purposes. Under the old system of serfdom the State had a direct claim upon the bodies, the goods, the time of the serfs. This has long ago disappeared; but the effect of this kind of legislation is to impose statutory labour upon public servants who, having to bear the disadvantages, disabilities and the reduction of their status as citizens, have a right to claim as their own, as intangible by no authority but that of Parliament, the compensation fixed for their work. Common sense indicates that, in order to have a contented public servant, willing and ready to renounce some of the rights and privileges of ordinary citizens, he must feel that both his tenure of office and his salary are secure and not subject to reductions in proportion to the means and needs of the province or municipality where his superior officers may send him to perform his public duties.\nIt may be noted that in rendering judgment in Abbott v. City of Saint John)[31], Sir Louis Davies expressly reserved to this court the faculty of reconsidering the question involved if confiscation of a substantial part of official or other salaries were attempted. Rebus sic stantibus, the decision was supposed to stand. But the situation is now entirely different. A small provincial or municipal tax in 1908, in the happy pre-war days, before any federal War Income Tax could be anticipated, when a 10 per cent. reduction of the federal salaries was not within the realm of possibilities, before Canada plunged into the vortex of European militarism, when a world-wide depression did not threaten the municipalities and provinces with bankruptcy, may have seemed a negligible matter, and de minimis non curat praetor. But now we must face the situation as it is; the fact indisputedly is that the efficiency of federal services is threatened if they have to provide besides the exigencies of Parliament, to the pressing and ever increasing needs of the local administrations. As Sir Frederick Pollock says in 45 Law Quarterly Review (1929), pp. 293 and foll.:\n[The court] must find and apply the rule which in all the circumstances appears most reasonable * * * The duty of the court is to keep the rules of law in harmony with the enlightened common sense of the nation. Such a duty, being put upon fallible men, cannot be performed with invariable and equal success. It is a matter of judgment, knowledge of the world, traditional or self-acquired bent of opinion, and perhaps above all of temperament. Caution and valour are both needed for the fruitful constructive interpretation of legal principles. The court should be even valiant to override the merely technical difficulties of professional thinking, and also current opinions having some show of authority, in the search for a solution which will be acceptable and in a general way intelligible to reasonable citizens, or the class of them whom the decision concerns. * * * Discretion is good and very necessary, but without valour the law would have no vitality at all.\nWe are, therefore, free, notwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis, and I deem it our duty, to reopen the broad question of the power of the legislature under the guise of direct taxation within the province to interfere with the salaries fixed and provided for by the Parliament of Canada for its civil and other officers. Moreover, it may not be amiss to point out that Abott was a tide waiter in the outside service of the Department of Customs, at a salary of $600 per year; and it is not clear, from the report of the case, that in the year 1907 such employees were precluded from engaging in gainful occupation outside of official duties. He complained that the City of Saint John assessed his salary and attempted to levy the sum of $2.22 for county taxes and $11.30 for city taxes. The court of New Brunswick, relying on a decision of the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim[32], affecting the Commonwealth of Australia, set aside the jurisprudence which had prevailed in Canada since Confederation and which had been very ably set forth and established in the powerful judgments of Spragg C., Hagarty C.J.C.P. and Burton & Patterson JJ.A. in Leprohon v. Corporation of The City of Ottawa[33]. When the Abbott case[34] came before this court, Girouard, J., wrote a strong dissenting opinion and refused to set aside the consistent and almost unanimous doctrine of our courts on the sole authority of Webb v. Outrim32.\nIt is difficult to understand why the considered conclusions of most eminent judges of our country, who, being in a better position to determine exactly the spirit and effect of the Confederation pact adopted in their lifetime, thought that, on this continent of America, the principles accepted by Chief Justice Marshall and other eminent judges of the Supreme Court of the United States with reference to the constitution of the neighbouring country and the reciprocal independence of National and State instrumentalities were to be adopted as a simple matter of common sense and propriety, should have been set aside to follow a decision of the Judicial Committee concerning the interpretation of the Australian constitution which is substantially different from ours, as appears in the judgments of the High Court of Australia when it subsequently refused to accept the Privy Council views in Baxter v. Commissioners of Taxation, New South Wales[35], and Cooper v. Commissioner of Income Tax for the State of Queensland[36]. It will be sufficient to quote sec. 107 of the Australian constitution to show the complete divergence with Canada as to the division of powers:\nEvery power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be.\nSee Clement on the Canadian Constitution, 3rd ed., pages 375 and 642, and 23 Law Quarterly Review (1907) 373\u2014about this much criticized decision.\nIn Caron v. The King[37], the appellant refused to pay the Dominion Income Tax on his salary as Minister of Agriculture for the province of Quebec and his indemnity as a Member of the Legislature. This Court said that the case was the converse of Abbott v. The City of Saint John[38], considered the authority of the Dominion to impose a tax on the salary of a provincial official and declared itself unable to distinguish the two cases.\nWith all due deference and diffidence, I would point out, however, that the facts in those two cases differed, because the Minister of Agriculture or a Member of the Legislature of the province of Quebec is not bound, for the salary or indemnity received as such, to devote his entire time or earning power to the province. These positions are not permanent and, as members of the Executive or of the Legislature, they are entirely free to enjoy all the civil rights of citizens; they are expected to have other gainful occupation and are not restricted as are members of the federal civil service. In view of this material difference as to the fundamental facts of the present case with those in Caron v. The King[39], I am of opinion that the judgments of this Court and of the Privy Council in Caron v. The King39 are not binding on us in the premises.\nThe respondent has also quoted City of Toronto v. Morson[40], where the Appellate Division of Ontario held that the defendant, one of the judges of a county court, was not exempt from municipal taxation under provincial legislation in respect of his salary or income as such judge. The fundamental error of this finding is to be found in the reasons of Mulock, C.J., and Riddell, J., put tersely by the latter as follows (p. 232):\nAs to the power of the province to tax such salaries, Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[41] decided that this power did not exist; and, had that decision stood, we should be bound to allow this appeal. But the Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of Abbott v. The City of Saint John[42], has deprived it of all authority; and, unless we are to disregard the Supreme Court decision we must hold that the power exists.\nClearly the learned judges in appeal assimilated one of His Majesty\u2019s judges to a civil servant. The exemption from taxation by provincial legislation of the salaries of judges would be based partly on different considerations than those that would apply to civil servants. Judges are not servants of the Crown; they are called to decide as between the subject and the Crown; and since the Act of Settlement their complete independence, economic and otherwise, has to be safeguarded in the public interest. Even Parliament, in order to reduce their salaries, had to impose a special tax whose validity is not to be affirmed or denied in the present case where the question does not arise. Suffice it to say that the case of Abbott v. City of Saint John42 should not have been considered as a binding precedent by the Court of Appeal of Ontario when a substantially different question was before them. Therefore, the Morson decision[43] has nothing to do with the case we are now considering and, in any event, was based on a wrong appreciation of the subject-matter that was at the root of this court\u2019s decision in the Abbott case42.\nIII\nIt has been said that both the Dominion Parliament and the Provincial Legislature have each been given sovereign powers within the scope of sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. The Imperial Parliament also gave to each of them the fixing of, and providing for, the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers for the respective government of Canada and of the provinces. These salaries or emoluments are attached to the position and are paid to the individual who happens to discharge the commission or the public duties assigned to him. In this case, the salary is payable by the federal departments. If the Dominion, to carry on the nation\u2019s business, has one of its officials living in one of the provinces, can it be said that the salary attached to the position whose duties for federal purposes are carried out within the geographical limits of the province, becomes a \u201cthing\u201d within the province and may be taxed for local purposes for the sole reason that the remittance may reach the recipient outside of the Capital of the Country? It seems to me that the principle of extra-territoriality, as in the case of the representative of a foreign power, should apply qua salary to the mutual benefit and advantage of the officials of the two sovereign powers co-existing and organized in this country under sec. 91 (8) and sec. 92 (4) of the British North America Act.\nIn Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[44], Lord Loreburn said:\nIn the interpretation of a completely self-governing Constitution founded upon a written organic instrument, such as the British North America Act, if the text is explicit the text is conclusive, alike in what it directs and what it forbids. When the text is ambiguous, as, for example, when the words establishing two mutually exclusive jurisdictions are wide enough to bring a particular power within either, recourse must be had to the context and scheme of the Act.\nThe purpose of the constitution was the creation of a new Dominion. Canada was intended to take its place among the free nations with such attributes and sovereignty as were consistent with its being still under the Crown. It is essential to the attribute of the sovereignty of any government that it shall not be interfered with by any external or internal power. The only interference, therefore, to be permitted is that prescribed by the constitution itself. A similar consequence follows with respect to the constituting provinces. In their case, however, the central government is empowered to interfere in certain prescribed cases. But under the scheme of the document, there are a number of subjects upon which the legislative power of both the Dominion and the provinces may be exercised. In such a state of things, if questions arise which interfere with the exercise of the sovereign power of the two sovereign authorities concerned, then the doctrine Quando lex aliquid concedit, concedere videtur et illud sine quo res ipsa valere non potest applies, as it must be the construction of all grants of powers. It follows that a grant of a sovereign power includes a grant of a right to disregard any attempt by any authority to control its exercise. A remarkable illustration of the application of this maxim is afforded in Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain and Attorney-General for Canada v. Gilhula[45], where it was held that the doctrine might be applied so as to exercise said powers even beyond territorial limits.\nThis view is emphasized in British Coal Corporation v. The King[46].\nUnder section 91 of the British North America Act, the\nexclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say:\n* * *\n(8) The fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\n* * *\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nTherefore, the Dominion Parliament alone can fix compensation to the Dominion civil servants and the same cannot be altered and no deduction made therefrom except by Parliament.\nBy the Civil Service Act, R.S.C (1927), Cap. 22, as amended by the Act 22 and 23 Geo. V, Cap. 40, Parliament has enacted new legislation regarding the civil servants that come within that statute.\nThis remuneration is fixed under this statute, and sec 10, subs. 1, provides as follows:\n10. (1) The civil service shall, as far as practicable, be classified and compensated in accordance with the classification of such service dated the first day of October, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, signed by the Commission and confirmed by chapter ten of the statutes of the year one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, second session, and with any amendments or additions thereto thereafter made; and references in this Act to such classification shall extend to include any such amendments or additions. This being an Act of Parliament, it is evident that no Provincial Legislature could interfere with, deduct from or pass any legislation compelling a Dominion civil servant to give up his salary or any portion thereof. It is Parliament and Parliament alone that can make any alterations in the law as it stands under the Civil Service Act. Even the Dominion Government itself could not without special enactment by Parliament change, alter or deduct from a Dominion civil servant any portion of the compensation to which he would be entitled and which has been set by the Civil Service Act.\nIV\nIf The Special Income Tax Act of the Manitoba Legislature taxes and attempts to intercept in the hands of the Dominion a portion of the remuneration which is fixed by the Dominion Parliament as compensation to the Dominion civil servant, would this be within the legislative power of the Provincial Legislature? The answer must be in the negative.\nIs the exemption from provincial interference by taxation or otherwise necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by head (8) of section 91? It is for the courts to lay down the line of necessity in this case. See: Montreal Street Ry. Co. v. City of Montreal[47], per Duff, J., at p. 229\u2014with whom Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick and Girouard, J., concurred, which decision was upheld in the Privy Council[48].\nThe same law which has prescribed bounds to the legislative power has imposed upon the judges the duty of seeing that these bounds are not overstepped. L\u2019Union St. Jacques v. Belisle[49], per Duval, C. J.\nCan it be denied that, under existing conditions in Canada since the war, the reduction of the salaries of Dominion employees in proportion to the needs of the provinces or municipalities, which in some cases are very great and are increasing alarmingly, would, if added to the reductions imposed by the Dominion Parliament, amount to confiscation of a substantial part thereof and would as a necessary consequence seriously impair the efficiency, morale and economic independence of the national service? It is a patent fact to anyone conversant with Canadian conditions, and any attempt by a Province to confiscate even in part the stipend fixed by Parliament, whatever name may be given to the operation, under whatever disguise it may be presented, is an unauthorized assumption of a power which is essentially national in its scope and operation and is expressly denied to the Province by the last phrase of section 91. The Dominion alone can fix the salaries; and once fixed, they cannot be changed or reduced by the Province. According to elementary common sense, without the necessity of recourse to learned legal distinctions or disquisitions, a salary minus a tax of 2, 5 or 10 per cent. is a reduced salary pro tanto. Such reduction in the case of Dominion servants can be effected by Parliament only in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction under head (8) of 91. Now the respondent contends that the Act contemplates and contains such an interference. I quote from the factum of the Attorney-General:\nIt is submitted that the Civil Servant is an \u201cemployee\u201d and that which he receives, viz., salary, is \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of the statute.\nThe \u201cemployee,\u201d who is required to pay the tax imposed by section 3 of the Act, is defined by section 2 (1) (b) as meaning \u201cany person who is in receipt of, or entitled to, any \u2018wages.\u2019\u201c The final determination, therefore, of who is an \u201cemployee,\u201d must depend upon the definition of \u201cwages.\u201d\nThe opening words of the definition of \u201cwages\u201d contained in section 2 (1) (d) are as follows:\n\u201c\u2018Wages\u2019 include all wages, salaries and emoluments from any source whatsoever * * * \u201d\nIt is submitted that no matter what term is used in describing the remuneration paid to a Civil Servant for his services, such remuneration will fall within the scope of that portion of the definition of \u201cwages\u201d quoted above. But the definition of \u201cwages\u201d is still broader in its scope for it continues:\n\u201cincluding\n(i) any compensation for labour or services, measured by the time, piece or otherwise;\n(ii) the salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration of members of the Senate and House of Commons of the Dominion and officers thereof, members of the Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies, members of municipal councils, commissions, or boards of management, and of any judge of any Dominion or provincial court, and of all persons whatsoever, whether such salaries, indemnities, or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any province thereof, or any person.\u201d It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the words \u201cthe salaries, indemnities or other remuneration * * * of all persons whatsoever,\u201d in the above quotation, plainly comprehend the salary or remuneration of the Civil Servant.\nI should now come to the legislation submitted to our scrutiny, which provides in part:\nPART I\nTaxation of Wages\n3. (1) In addition to all other taxes to which he is liable under this or any other Act, every employee shall pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax of two per centum upon the amount of all wages earned by or accruing due to him on or after the first day of May, 1933, which tax shall be levied and collected at the times and in the manner prescribed by this part; * * *\n4. (1) Every employer at the time of payment of wages to an employee shall levy and collect the tax imposed on the employee by this part in respect of the wages of the employee earned or accruing due during the period covered by the payment, and shall deduct and retain the amount of the tax from the wages payable to the employee, and shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month next following that in which the payment of wages takes place, or at such other time as the regulations prescribe, pay to the administrator the full amount of the tax. No employee shall have any right of action against his employer in respect of any moneys deducted from his wages and paid over to the administrator by the employer in compliance or intended compliance with this section.\n(2) Every employer shall, with each payment made by him to the administrator under this section, furnish to the administrator a return showing all taxes imposed by this part on the employees of the employer in respect of wages during the period covered by the return, which shall be in the form and verified in the manner prescribed by the administrator.\n(3) Every employer who deducts or retains the amount of any tax under this part from the wages of his employee shall be deemed to hold the same in trust for His Majesty and for the payment over of the same in the manner and at the time provided under this part.\n6. (1) If an employer, in violation of the provisions of this part fail to collect and pay over any tax imposed by this part, the administrator may demand and collect from him as a penalty ten per cent. of the tax payable, and he shall in addition be liable to a fine of ten dollars for each day of default, but not to more than two hundred dollars.\n(2) Every person, who contravenes any provision of this part in respect of which no penalty is otherwise provided, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, and each day\u2019s continuance of the act or default out of which the offence arises shall constitute a separate offence; but nothing contained in this section nor the enforcement of any penalty thereunder shall suspend or affect any remedy for the recovery of any tax payable under this part or of any moneys in the hands of an employer belonging to His Majesty.\n7. In case the wages earned or accruing due to an employee are paid to him without the tax imposed thereon being deducted therefrom by his employer, it shall be the duty of the employee to forthwith pay the tax, and all the provisions of sections 23, 23A, 24 and 25 of The Income Tax Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the collection and recovery of the tax so imposed from the employer and employee, or either of them.\nIt would appear that section 7 makes the employee liable secondarily and conditionally, if\u2014against the clear purpose of the legislator\u2014the salary has been paid to him; the operation of the whole Act as contemplated by the legislature seems to strike at the employer first and directly for the recovery of the tax on his accruing obligation to pay wages; this is intercepting it and preventing its receipt by the officer to whom it is due. This, as pertinently remarked by Mr. Clement in his work on the Constitution, 3rd ed., p. 642, can be enacted by the federal parliament only. Moreover, if the employer pays the tax, it is expected, and in fact it is embodied in the Act, that he will recoup himself: \u201che shall deduct and retain the amount of the tax from the wages payable to the employee\u201d to whom a right of action is denied by section 4 (1) against the employer in respect of any moneys so deducted and paid over to the provincial collector.\nNow, direct taxes are those that are levied upon the very person who is supposed as a general thing to bear their burden. When a person pays one of these taxes, he is likely to bear the burden himself and is not likely to shift it to another. Indirect taxes are those that are collected from one person (the employer according to the operation of Part I of the Act) and then transferred in whole or in part by that person to another (in this case the employee). The distinction between direct and indirect taxation is made clear by considering the manner in which the tax is levied.\nDirect taxes are amongst those levied on permanent and recurring occasions and are assessed according to some list or roll of persons. The taxpayer is regarded as definitely and permanently ascript to the treasury. Indirect taxes, on the other hand, are levied according to a tariff on the occurrence of transactions and events which are not previously ascertainable as regards particular persons. The amount of a direct tax assessed in this way is certain and regular, while an indirect tax is uncertain and irregular, as regards individuals. (Nicholson).\nUnder Part I of the Act, no employee is required to make returns\u2014only the employer. No penalty against the employee is enacted; but we find a heavy one against the employer who would dare not to disclose his payroll and deduct the tax.\nReading the whole modum operandi of this Part I, I feel inclined to classify it as a clear attempt by the legislature to strike first directly at the source of these wages, before they reach the employee, expecting direct payment from the employer and indirectly by the wage earner; this would be ultra vires of sec. 92 (2), as understood and applied in a long line of decisions. But is it necessary to declare the Act ultra vires in its entirety? Would it be sufficient in this case to say that it cannot affect the salaries or \u201cwages\u201d or other remunerations paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in the right of the Dominion?\nIt seems obvious that the bones and sinews of Part I consist in the interception of wages in the hands of the employer. Now, as shown above, the respondent says that the \u201cemployer\u201d referred to in the statute includes the Crown, but does not claim that the rights of the Dominion Crown can be or are affected by the collecting sections 4, 5, 6 and 7. The contract of employment by the Crown cannot be severed and if the salary cannot be intercepted in the hands of the government because it is earned and paid purely and solely to carry out the business of the country, it should also be left alone by provincial taxation after it reaches the employee. Section 7 must be read with the preceding sections, and if, admittedly, the Federal Crown cannot be forced to make returns and payments to the Province, the same protection should enure to the benefit of the other party to this particular contract of employment.\nIt would seem that the tax is \u201cthe exaction * * * of a percentage duty on services\u201d of which Lord Cave said that it \u201cwould ordinarily be regarded\u201d and should be classified \u201cas indirect taxation\u201d\u2014City of Halifax v. Fairbanks Estate[50], quoted by Rinfret, J., in rendering judgment for this Court in City of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime Ltd.[51], where the authorities are very accurately and concisely reviewed.\nV\nThe appellant does not claim protection as a resident of Manitoba, but as an instrumentality of the Dominion government. The present Chief Justice, in his judgment in the Abbott case[52], referred to Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[53]. But we cannot at this date overlook the reasoning of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[54], where was declared ultra vires a provincial Act which interfered, directly and substantially, with the status and capacity conferred on certain companies by Dominion legislation intra vires under sec. 91. In this present case also, this legislation is not saved by the fact that all wage-earners in the Province are aimed at and that there is no special discrimination against Dominion employees. \u201cThe matter,\u201d says Lord Sumner at p. 268, \u201cdepends upon the effect of the legislation not upon its purpose.\u201d The effect in this case is clearly to impair the status and earnings of a class of persons who are entitled to look to the Dominion Parliament as the exclusive authority with power to fix and determine such matters. A fortiori in the case of a federal civil servant, should the words of Lord Sumner apply, mutatis mutandis, when he says at p. 267:\nAs a matter of construction it is now well settled that, in the case of a company incorporated by Dominion authority with power to carry on its affairs in the provinces generally, it is not competent to the legislatures of those provinces so to legislate as to impair the status and essential capacities of the company in a substantial degree.\nIt is my firm view that, as a matter of fact, the Province of Manitoba, by the Act under consideration, does, in effect if not purposely, impair the status and essential rights of the civil service to receive whole and without reduction the salary fixed and voted by Parliament. By doing so, the statute is bound to affect and reduce the efficiency of the service for the reasons above given.\nNow, if admittedly Part I of the statute is ultra vires, as applying to the employer, because the tax as collected would have to be charged back to the employee, can the illegal part of the statute be severed from the allegedly legal part, section 7? The answer is found in a judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[55], where Lord Haldane said:\n* * * If the statute is ultra vires as regards the first class of cases, it has to be pronounced to be ultra vires altogether. Their Lordships agree with Duff J. in his view that if the Act is inoperative as regards brokers, agents and others, it is not possible for any court to presume that the legislature intended to pass it in what may prove to be a highly truncated form. VI\nThis statute is designed to exact a percentage not from the total income, but from the \u201cwages or salaries\u201d at their source. This would be sufficient to distinguish this case from Abbott v. City of Saint John[56], in which, as pointed out by Sir Louis Davies, the statute did not provide for a special tax on the wages of Dominion officials, but was a general undiscriminatory tax upon the total incomes of all residents in the province. In this view, this appeal could be maintained, even if this Court considered itself bound by the rule stare decisis.\nVII\nThe statute is essentially an attempt to reach the wage earner indirectly through the employer who, to all intents and purposes, is the taxpayer and the only one subject to penalties under the scheme of Part I of the Act. In this respect, this Part I of the statute providing for the interception before payment, with such provisions for recoupment as shown above, must be held to be obnoxious to the restrictions imposed upon the provincial authority.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal without costs, as agreed between the parties, and dismiss the action.\nCannon J. (dissenting) delivered the following judgment in the Worthington appeal:\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014Mutatis mutandis, my reasons in the case of James Forbes v. The Attorney-General of Manitoba would apply to this case.\nIn addition, s. 91 (7) of the British North America Act confers exclusive authority to the Parliament of Canada on \u201cMilitia, Military and Naval Service, and Defence.\u201d The power was exercised by the enactment of the Militia Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 132. Section 32 of the latter provides for the fixing of pay and allowances of the officers and men of the permanent force which, under section 22, consist of such permanently embodied corps, enrolled for continuous service. Appellant, therefore, must give all his time to the nation and cannot engage in any other gainful occupation. He is entitled to receive from the Consolidated Fund upon warrant directed by the Governor General to the Minister of Finance the emoluments granted to him for the dignity of the State and for his decent support. Flarty v. Odium[57].\nSections 139, 140 and 141 of the Militia Act provide that \u201cregulations for the organization, discipline, efficiency and good government\u201d of the militia made by the Governor in Council shall, on publication, have the same force in law as if they formed part of the Militia Act. Accordingly, the following regulations may be noted:\n35. Officers shall, on appointment in or promotion to the ranks or grades set forth in these Regulations, be entitled to receive the rates of pay therefor as herein prescribed, subject to such deductions, forfeitures or limitations as may from time to time be authorized by statute or by regulations duly approved by the Governor-General-in-Council.\n46. Warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men shall on enlistment in or promotion to the ranks or grades hereinafter specified be entitled to pay at the following daily rates, subject to such deductions, forfeitures or limitations as may from time to time be authorized by regulations duly approved by the Govemor-General-in-Council,\nIn my opinion, no deductions from such pay may be lawfully made by any other authority, and the provisions of Part I of the Act in question, if they really, as the respondent contends, require deductions to be made in respect of \u201cPay and Allowances\u201d of any officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers or men, are beyond the competence of the Legislative Assembly of the province of Manitoba to enact.\nThe Pay and Allowances prescribed, being matters of the King\u2019s bounty, are such as in the discretion of His Majesty will be sufficient for the maintenance of the position and dignity of the King\u2019s officers and soldiers. This is exemplified by considering the following regulation, which likewise has the force of law, namely:\u2014\nKing\u2019s Regulations and Orders, Paragraph:\n1006. (2) A subaltern with sufficient means to maintain himself and family in a manner befitting his position as an officer may, upon the recommendation of his Commanding Officer, be permitted by the Minister to marry.\nQuite obviously, such law, denying the civil right of marriage to a subaltern officer, except with the approval of his Commanding Officer and permission of the Minister, is enacted for no other purpose than that no calls shall be made upon the \u201cPay and Allowances\u201d of such subaltern officer beyond those which, in the opinion of constituted authority, such \u201cPay and Allowances\u201d will enable him to discharge and still maintain himself in the position and with the dignity befitting an officer.\nThis, under our system, has always been considered as a matter of policy in the interest of the public weal.\nEven if the Legislature were competent, it is at least doubtful whether or not the \u201cpay and allowances\u201d are \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of Part I of the Act, and, therefore, as this is a matter of taxation, the appellant subject should be given the benefit of the doubt and should not be compelled to pay by straining the definition of the word. The King v. Crabbs[58].\nI would agree with the conclusions of Mr. Justice Robson that the province could not by any means take away from the pay and allowances of military officers and, further, that the Act should not be read as intending to do so.\nI would allow the appeal, without costs, as per agreement of parties, and dismiss the action.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014As I read Part I of The Special Income Tax Act of 1933, with the provisions of its interpretation section, its primary purpose is to tax, subject to the exemptions set forth in s. 3, the wages of all employees in the hands of their respective employers.\nWhile s. 3 (1) enacts that in addition to all other taxes to which he is liable \u201cevery employee shall pay to His Majesty * * * a tax of two per centum upon the amount of all wages earned by or accruing due to him on or after the first day of May, 1933,\u201d it specifically provides in the succeeding clause that this tax \u201cshall be levied and collected at the times and in the manner prescribed by this part.\u201d\nS. 4 then prescribes, not only the times at which and the manner in which the tax shall be levied and collected, but in the most explicit terms imposes upon every employer at the time of payment of wages to an employee the duty of levying and collecting the tax \u201cin respect of the wages of the employee earned or accruing due during the period covered by the payment\u201d by deducting and retaining \u201cthe amount of the tax from the wages payable to the employee,\u201d and of paying the full amount thereof to the administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the month next following that in which the payment of wages takes place or at such other time as the regulations prescribe. It then enacts that no employee shall have any right of action against his employer in respect of any moneys \u201cdeducted from his wages and paid over to the administrator by the employer in compliance or intended compliance with this section.\u201d\nWith all deference, I cannot think that these provisions of s. 4 (1) are mere provisions of procedure. Read in connection with the language of s. 3, as they are expressly required to be by the words of reference above quoted from that section, they are the vital provisions which specifically indicate the real incidence and effect of the tax, fixing not only the time or times at which the tax shall be paid and the manner in which it shall be levied and collected, but the particular moneys upon and from and out of which it shall be levied, deducted and paid, and the person (the employer) who shall so levy and deduct it and ultimately pay it to the income tax administrator.\nIf it is the normal or general tendency of the tax which is to be considered and the intention is to be inferred from the form in which the tax is imposed, as laid down in the Fairbanks case[59], quoted by Rinfret, J., in delivering the judgment of this Court in City of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime Ltd.[60], it seems to me to be perfectly clear that, notwithstanding the tax is described as imposed on the employee in respect of his wages, ss. 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Part I plainly demonstrate that the real purpose and intention, primarily at least, is to impose the tax, not upon the employee or upon the income from wages received by the employee, but upon the earned and accruing wages of the employee in the hands of the employer before they are paid to the employee. The words \u201cupon the amount of all wages earned by or accruing due to him\u201d in s. 3; the obligation so expressly imposed on the employer in s. 4 to \u201cdeduct and retain the amount of the tax from the wages payable to the employee\u201d and \u201cpay to the administrator the full amount of the tax\u201d; the duty cast upon the employer by s. 4 (2) to \u201cfurnish to the administrator a return showing all taxes imposed by this part\u201d; and the penalty provisions of s. 6 (1 and 2), it seems to me, all shew that this is the only fair and reasonable construction of these four sections.\nThe provisions of s. 7 completely accord with this conclusion, requiring, as they do, the employee to pay the tax only in the event of the employer paying over to the employee the wages earned or accruing due to him without deducting the tax imposed thereon, and prescribing, as they do by their reference to s. 25 of The Income Tax Act (C.A. 1924, c 91, as amended), the only manner in which the tax may be recovered from the employee in such a contingency, viz., by action for its recovery as a debt due to His Majesty. This remedy obviously is not available against the employee if the employer has deducted and withheld the full amount of the tax from the employee\u2019s wages and paid it to the tax administrator, as he is explicitly obliged to do by the provisions of s. 4 (1), on pain of the fines and penalties prescribed by s. 6.\nConsidering the enactment, therefore, as a whole, I cannot for my part accede to the proposition so strenuously pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the respondent that its real intent and effect is to impose the tax upon the person of the employee in respect of his income. In my view, as I have already indicated, its normal and general effect is, not to impose the tax as a general income tax upon the employee personally, but to tax his earned and accruing wages as such in the hands of the employer before they are received by the employee. Earned and accruing wages, payable to an employee, but not in fact paid to him, cannot well be said to be income at all.\nThat the enactment was intended to apply to the salaries, pay and allowances of civil servants and other employees of the Dominion Government and of officers and men of the Militia of Canada, as well as to the salaries and wages of all other persons, is plainly shewn by s. 2 (1) (b), (c) and (d). S. 2 (1) (d), after defining \u201cwages\u201d as including \u201call wages, salaries and emoluments from any source whatsoever,\u201d specifically provides that the term shall include inter alia the salaries, indemnities or other remuneration of members of the Senate and House of Commons of the Dominion and officers thereof, and of any Judge of any Dominion or Provincial Court, and of all persons whatsoever \u201cwhether such salaries, indemnities or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any province thereof, or any person.\u201d\nWhatever may be said as to the constitutional right of a provincial legislature to impose, in addition to the increasingly burdensome federal income and other taxes, a tax of two per cent. upon earned or accruing wages in the hands of other employers, there can, I think, be no doubt that no provincial legislation can validly tax the funds of the Government of Canada, appropriated and held in its hands for the payment of the salaries, pay and emoluments of its own civil servants and other employees and the officers and men of the Militia of Canada, or compel the Government of Canada or any of its representatives by means of fines and penalties to withhold any portion of such salaries, pay and emoluments, from those to whom they are due and payable, and hand it over to a provincial tax receiver in payment of any provincial tax.\nAs regards the enactment now under review, I have, for my part, no hesitation in holding that, in so far as its provisions seek to tax federal salaries or other pay or allowances in the hands of the Government of Canada, they are entirely void and inoperative. The Dominion Government very properly ignored the Act, and the appellants Worthington and Forbes continued to receive their pay and salary cheques in full as before, the former as an officer of the Active Militia of Canada and the latter as a member of the Civil Service of Canada.\nThese actions were afterwards brought against them to recover the tax of two per cent. on all wages earned by them as employees of the Government of Canada, and paid to them respectively out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada, monthly between May 1 and Dec. 31, 1933, without the said tax having been deducted therefrom. They are, as the statements of claim in both cases clearly shew, actions for the recovery of the tax upon wages, not only \u201cearned or accruing due,\u201d but upon wages \u201cpaid to the defendant without the said tax having been deducted therefrom,\u201d and as such clearly can be supported, if at all, only under the provisions of s. 7.\nThe question accordingly arises as to whether this section, which purports to impose upon the employee the liability to pay the tax only in the event of its not having been deducted from his wages and paid by the employer, can reasonably be severed, in an action brought against an employee of the Dominion Government, from the provisions of the previous sections, which in their application to the salaries, pay and allowances of civil and other employees of the Dominion Government are ultra vires of the legislature. In my opinion they cannot, the liability for payment of the tax having been primarily placed upon the employer and only secondarily or conditionally upon the employee. The secondary liability of the employee cannot fairly be held in a taxing statute to stand alone if the primary liability, out of which it arises or for which it is substituted, is unconstitutional and void.\nFor these reasons I concur in the conclusions of my brother Cannon that both these appeals should be allowed and the actions against the appellants dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant Worthington: Phillips, Gemmill & Smith.\nSolicitors for the appellant Forbes: Finkelstein, Finkelstein & White.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Allen.\n[1] 42 Man.

Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nConstitutional law\u2014The Employment and Social Insurance Act, 25-26 Geo. V, c. 38\u2014Constitutional validity\u2014Taxation\u2014Property and civil rights.\nThe Employment and Social Insurance Act provides (Part I, sections 4 to 9 inclusive) for the administration of the Act by a Commission consisting of three members to be called the Employment and Social Insurance Commission, whose duties are defined in these sections. Part II (sections 10 to 14 inclusive) of the Act provides for the organization and administration by the Commission of an employment service for the Dominion of Canada with regional divisions and a central employment office and employment offices within each division. Part III (sections 15 to 38 inclusive) of the Act provides for the establishment of an Unemployment Insurance Fund out of which unemployment insurance benefits would be payable to all persons of the age of sixteen years and upwards who are engaged in any of the insurable employments specified in the Act. Such fund is to be derived partly from moneys provided by Parliament and partly from compulsory contributions by employers and workers. The statutory conditions governing the eligibility and ineligibility of insured contributors for the receipt of benefits are defined in the Act. Penalties are provided for fraudulently obtaining benefits or evading payment and for other violations of the Act or the regulations under it. Part IV (sections 39 to 41 inclusive) of the Act, under the heading \u201cNational Health,\u201d charges the Commission with the duty of collecting information concerning any scheme, actual or proposed, for providing medical, dental, surgical and hospital care, and compensation for loss of earnings due to ill-health or accident. (Further particulars of the Act are contained in the judgments reported).\nHeld, per Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Kerwin JJ., that the Act is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada; Duff C.J. and Davis J. holding that the Act is intra vires.\nPer Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The validity of the legislation cannot be supported either as an exercise of the residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, or as an exercise of the power to regulate trade and commerce.\nThe proposition that the Act could be supported in virtue of the power of the Dominion Parliament concerning statistics or criminal law need not retain our attention.\nThe legislation is not based on the Treaty of Peace (1919) and, therefore, no reliance for its validity can be made on section 132 of the B.N.A. Act.\nNor can it be supported under \u201cthe power to raise money by any mode or system of taxation,\u201d or \u201cthe power to appropriate public money for any public purpose.\u201d The statute, in its substance, is not an exercise of those powers. It clearly, indicates that the Parliament of Canada intended primarily to legislate with regard to employment service, to unemployment insurance and to health matters. It is not concerned either with public debt and property or with the raising of money by taxation. Its provisions for levying contributions for the creation of the Unemployment Insurance Fund are nothing more than provisions to enable the carrying out of the true and only purpose of the legislation. These contributions (or taxes, if they are to be so called) are mere incidents of the attempted regulation of employment service and unemployment insurance.\nIt being well understood, and in fact conceded, that the subject-matters of the Act fall within the legislative authority of the provinces, the Dominion Parliament may not, under pretext of the exercise of the power to deal with its property or to raise money by taxation, indirectly accomplish the ends sought for in this legislation.\nThe effect of the Act under submission is \u201cto attach statutory terms to contracts of employment\u201d (Lord Haldane in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway, [1920] A.C. 184); and its immediate result is to create civil rights as between employers and employees. The Dominion Parliament cannot use its power of taxation to compel the insertion of conditions of that character in ordinary employment contracts.\nPer Duff C. J. and Davis J. dissenting.\u2014The aims stated in the preamble of the Act are legitimate, provided, of course, that the enactments themselves are within the ambit of the legislative powers possessed by Parliament. Reading subdivision 1 of section 91 and subdivision 3 of the B.N.A. Act together, the proper conclusion is that Parliament has exclusive authority to raise money by any mode or system of taxation for disposition by Parliament for any purpose for which it is competent to Parliament to apply the assets of the Dominion in virtue of subdivision 1. In effect, subdivision 1 endowes the High Court of Parliament with full discretionary authority to dispose of the public assets of the Dominion, and no other court is invested with jurisdiction to examine any purported exercise of that authority with a view to pronouncing upon its validity, subject only to the rule that the courts are always entitled to determine whether, in truth, any given enactment of Parliament professing to be an exercise of a given authority is not really an enactment of that character; but one relating to a subject over which Parliament has no jurisdiction.\nThe provisions requiring compulsory contributions by employers and employed possess the essential elements of legislation respecting taxation. On their true, construction, they have that character because, first, it would not be competent to a provincial legislature to enact them in the context in which they stand, which demonstrates that the contributions are exacted for the purpose of raising moneys for exclusive disposition by Parliament; and, second, there is no adequate ground for holding that they are, either in purpose or in immediate effect, outside the ambit of the powers under subdivision 3.\nSo also as regards the enactments concerning the disposition of the proceeds of the levies upon employers and employed and of the contribution from the Dominion treasury. They are not enactments in respect of property and civil rights in any one province or in all of the provinces. They would not be competent as enactments by any or all of the provincial legislatures, and there is no adequate ground for affirming that these enactments are not legislation in relation to the subjects within the scope of subdivision 1. Parliament can in the legitimate exercise of its exclusive authority under subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, levy taxes for the purpose of raising money to constitute a fund to be expended, in conformity with the directions of Parliament, in unemployment benefits, and provide for a contribution to that fund from the Dominion treasury, and in executing these exclusive powers, Parliament is not subject to any control by the courts as to the form of the taxation or the incidence of it or as touching the manner or conditions of the payment of benefits.\nComplete discretionary authority respecting the form and incidence of taxation under subdivision 3, and respecting the disposal of all public assets under subdivision 1, are essential to enable Parliament to discharge the responsibilities entrusted to it.\nLegislation for raising money for disposition by Parliament under subdivision 3 of section 91, and directing the disposition of it under subdivision 1, is necessarily excluded from the jurisdiction of the provinces by the concluding words of section 91; and there is no sufficient ground for affirming that, in the enactments of this statute, Parliament is not exercising its powers under these subdivisions, or, in other words, that under the guise of doing so it is invading a provincial field from which it is excluded, for the purpose of attaining a result which it has full power to attain by legislating within fields in which it has exclusive authority.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), of the following question: Is the Employment and Social Insurance Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the question to the Court reads as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 31st October, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to the Employment and Social Insurance Act, chapter 38 of the statutes of Canada, 1935, which was passed for the purposes set out in the recitals contained in the preamble of the said Act.\nThe Minister observes that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had legislative jurisdiction to enact the said Act, either in whole or in part, and that it is expedient such question should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following question be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act,\u2014\nIs the Employment and Social Insurance Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n*The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The preamble to the statute is as follows:\u2014\nWHEREAS the Dominion of Canada was a signatory, as part of the British Empire, to the Treaty of Peace made between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles, on the 28th day of June, 1919; and whereas the said Treaty of Peace was confirmed by the Treaties of Peace Act 1919; and whereas, by article 23 of the said Treaty, each of the signatories thereto agreed that they would endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and by article 427 of the said Treaty declared that the well-being, physical, moral and intellectual, of industrial wage-earners is of supreme international importance; and whereas it is desirable to discharge the obligations to Canadian labour assumed under the provisions of the said Treaty; and whereas it is essential for the peace, order and good government of Canada to provide for a National Employment Service and Insurance against unemployment, and for other forms of Social Insurance and for the purpose of maintaining on equitable terms, interprovincial and international trade, and to authorize the creation of a National Fund out of which benefits to unemployed persons throughout Canada will be payable and to provide for levying contributions from employers and workers for the maintaining of the said Fund and for contributions thereto by the Dominion: Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\u2014\nNo one of the aims stated in this preamble is illegitimate as an ultimate aim of legislation by the Parliament of Canada. If the subject matter of the enactment is within the ambit of the powers vested in Parliament it is lawful for Parliament to exercise those powers for the attainment of any or all of the objects set forth.\nThe immediate effect of the statute is to provide, by the means prescribed, a system of unemployment insurance. The essential elements of the scheme are the creation of the Fund\u2014the Unemployment Insurance Fund\u2014which is provided in part from compulsory contributions by employers and employees in the insured employments, and in part by contributions from the Dominion Treasury under the authority of Parliament. The administration of the Fund is entrusted to a Board and unemployment benefits are payable by the Board out of the Fund to designated classes of unemployed persons under prescribed statutory conditions.\nThe exclusive legislative authority of Parliament extends inter alia to the subject \u201cThe Public . . Property.\u201d It cannot be doubted, we think, that \u201cproperty\u201d here is used in its broadest sense, and includes every kind of asset. This legislative authority is exercisable \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act.\u201d There is always, of course, the qualification, and everything hereinafter said is subject to that qualification, that Parliament is incapable of acquiring jurisdiction over matters within the exclusive competence of the provinces by legislating upon those matters under the pretence of exercising a power which does not embrace within its ambit the real subject matter of the legislation. Subject to that qualification, we know of no authority by which His Majesty\u2019s Courts have jurisdiction to examine, with a view to pronouncing upon its validity, legislation by Parliament in relation to the disposition of the assets committed to its control by section 91, B.N.A. Act.\nSome reference was made on the argument to sections 102 and 106 B.N.A. Act, but we cannot find anything in those sections which in any way qualifies the authority bestowed by section 91. The phrase in section 106 \u201cshall be appropriated by the Parliament of Canada for the public service\u201d cannot, with propriety, be read, especially in view of the words already mentioned \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act,\u201d as restricting the discretion of the High Court of Parliament to determine finally what objects are and what objects are not within the scope of the words \u201cfor the public service of Canada.\u201d\nIt cannot, therefore, we think\u2014and we do not think this was disputed on the argument, although we do not desire to put what we have to say upon any suggested admission\u2014at all events, it cannot, we think, be disputed, even with plausibility, that, in point of strict law, Parliament has authority to make grants out of the public monies to individual inhabitants of any of the provinces, for example, for relief of distress, for reward of merit, or for any other object which Parliament in its wisdom may deem to be a desirable one. The propriety of such grants, the wisdom of such grants, the convenience or inconvenience of the practice of making such grants, are considerations for Parliament alone, and have no relevency in any discussion before any other Court concerning the competence of Parliament to authorize them.\nWe are satisfied, therefore, that, if Parliament, out of public monies exclusively, were to constitute a fund for the relief of unemployment and to give to unemployed persons a right to claim unemployment benefits, to be paid out of that fund upon such conditions as Parliament might see fit to prescribe, no plausible argument could be urged against the validity of such legislation.\nIt seems equally clear that it is exclusively within the discretion of Parliament to determine the manner in which the public assets shall be appropriated and applied for such purposes. The proceeds of any given tax, the sales tax, for example, might be validly appropriated for the purposes of such a fund. The appropriation might be affected antecedently by a direction that all or part of the proceeds of the tax should form such a fund in the hands of the Minister of Finance, or of any agency that might be designated for the purpose. The statute might take the form of requiring the Minister of Finance to pay into the fund monies from time to time provided by Parliament. True, the expectations of the authors of the scheme or of the intended beneficiaries might in any such case be falsified. Future Parliaments might find themselves in a state of financial embarrassment making it impossible to carry out the plan, or, if you like, regardless of the consequent disappointment and suffering, under altered views of policy or duty, abrogate the scheme and discontinue the payment of the benefits. But such possibilities and contingencies have no bearing upon the validity of such an enactment.\nBy section 35 (2) the statute now before us enacts as follows:\u2014\nThe Minister of Finance shall also deposit in like manner from time to time out of moneys provided by Parliament an amount equal to one-fifth of the aggregate deposits from time to time made as aforesaid after deducting from the said aggregate deposits any refunds of contributions from time to time made under the provisions of this Act from the Fund. Some comment was made upon this provision; but the gist of the comment was that the observance of the mandate laid upon the Minister of Finance is necessarily contingent upon some further legislative act making available \u201cmonies provided by Parliament.\u201d\nThe enactment, nevertheless, is an enactment dealing with the public assets of the Dominion; it gives an explicit direction to the Minister of Finance as to the application of \u201cmonies provided by Parliament\u201d for the purposes of the statute. The circumstance that the fate of the scheme may be dependent upon the action of future Parliaments is a circumstance which is of no pertinence in a question of the authority of the Parliament to give such a direction.\nThe real weight of the arguments against the legislation is to be found in the contention that the provisions of the statute are enactments on the subject of \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d and not enactments touching any subject falling within the enumerated heads or the introductory words of section 91 B.N.A. Act. This argument has two branches. First of all, it is said that, as regards compulsory contributions, the legislation creates a compulsory contract between the persons liable to contribute and the Crown, or the Minister of Finance, to whom, in effect, the contributions are payable. Second, it is said, adapting the language of Lord Haldane in delivering the judgment in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[1], that the statute attaches statutory terms to contracts of employment; and that this is the real pith and substance of it.\nThe Dominion contends that the compulsory contributions are contributions which Parliament is competent to exact under the third subdivision of section 91, by which the exclusive legislative authority of Canada extends to all matters within the subject \u201cThe raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\u201d As introductory to an examination of the argument on behalf of the Dominion, some brief general observations on this third subdivision of section 91 will not be out of place.\nThe authority, it will be noticed, is an authority to legislate in relation to the raising of money. There is no limitation in those words as respects the purpose or purposes to which the money is to be applied. An enactment, the real purpose of which is to raise \u201cmoney by any mode or system of taxation,\u201d is not examinable by the courts as to its validity by a reference to the motives by which Parliament is influenced, or the ultimate destination of the proceeds of the tax. We speak, of course, subject to the qualification explained above which we shall not restate. There is one express qualification in the B.N.A. Act. That is contained in section 125 and precludes the taxation of the public property of the Dominion or of the provinces. Reading the words of subdivisions 1 and 3 together, we have no doubt that the words of subdivision 3 necessarily mean that Parliament is empowered to raise money, for the exclusive disposition of Parliament, by any mode or system of taxation.\nIn passing, it will not be out of place to observe that, reading the words of head no. 3 in this way helps to remove the difficulty which has been suggested in reconciling the language of head no. 3 of section 91 with head no. 2 of section 92, \u201cdirect taxation for provincial purposes within the province.\u201d If you read head no. 2 of section 92 with section 126, and by the light of the observations of Lord Watson in St. Catherine Milling Co. v. The Queen[2] there is, we think, solid ground for the conclusion that the words \u201cfor provincial purposes\u201d mean neither more nor less than this: the taxing power of the legislatures is given to them for raising money for the exclusive disposition of the legislature. In this view, the subdivision of section 91 which deals with taxation, and section 92 which deals with the same subject, are on different planes and cannot come into conflict.\nEven if to the words \u201cfor provincial purposes\u201d in head no. 2 of section 92 there be ascribed a more restrictive operation, it seems clear enough that the power to legislate for taxation under that head, which is concerned with taxation for the purpose of raising monies for the exclusive disposition of the local legislature (even assuming, as we say, that in such disposition the provincial legislature is subject to some additional limitation imposed by the phrase \u201cprovincial purposes\u201d) there is nothing in this head which can conflict with the exclusive authority given by the third head of section 91 \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d to raise money by any mode or system of taxation for the exclusive disposition of Parliament. The two enactments are still on different planes. The one is concerned with raising money to be appropriated by the provincial legislatures exclusively, the other is concerned with raising money to be appropriated by Parliament exclusively for those purposes to which it thinks it advisable to devote the public assets of the Dominion.\nAt all events, it seems to be abundantly clear that there is nothing in either section 91 or section 92 which precludes the Dominion from raising money by any mode or system of taxation to be expended in the relief of distress among the inhabitants of any one or more provinces by direct application for the benefit of the inhabitants as individuals, still less for raising money to be expended for the relief of the inhabitants of the Dominion, almost all of whom are necessarily inhabitants of the provinces. The inhabitants of the provinces are taxable by the Dominion in order to raise moneys for any purpose in the furtherance of which it is competent to the Dominion to expend such moneys in exercise of its exclusive and plenary control over the public assets.\nIt is not improper here, we think, to advert to the character of the legislative powers of Parliament. We have had occasion to observe in connection with one of the other references that certain negative provisions of the Statute of Westminster emphasize in the most significant way the scope and character of these powers. First, there are the Recitals that\n* * * it is meet and proper to set out by way of preamble to this Act that, inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom:\nand that,\n* * * it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the said Dominions as part of the law of that Dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion: Then, there is the enactment, section 7 (1), which, in categorical terms, provides that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\nSubject to the restrictions in the Statute of Westminster and the British North America Act, and to whatever restrictions may be implied in the status of the Dominion, as owing a common allegiance to the Crown with the other members of the British Commonwealth, the Parliament of Canada is invested with plenary authority to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada over the whole field of legislative action, saving only those fields which, by the enactments of the British North America Act, have been withdrawn from it and assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures.\nThis authority is not a delegated authority, as, for example, that of the legislative bodies of the United States. It is an authority which exists in virtue of the supreme law of the state and is of the same order, subject, of course, to the restrictions mentioned, as the legislative authority of the Imperial Parliament.\nThe language of subdivision 3 could hardly be broader. \u201cAny mode or system of taxation\u201d leaves in Parliament unlimited discretion so long as the essentials of taxation are present.\nBy section 17 of the statute now before us, the employed and employer are \u201cliable\u201d to pay contributions in accordance with the provisions of the second schedule of the Act which prescribes the rate of contribution. The payments are to be made by means of revenue stamps and section 18 authorizes the Governor in Council by regulation to provide for the payment of contributions\nby means of revenue stamps affixed to or impressed upon books or cards * * * and such stamps and the devices for impressing the same shall be prepared and issued in such manner as may be prescribed by such regulation.\nBy subsection 2,\n* * * the Commission may make regulations providing for any matters relating to the payment and collection of contributions payable under this Act, and in particular for\u2014\n(a) regulating the manner, times and conditions, in, at and under which payments are to be made; (b) the entry in or upon unemployment books or cards of particulars of contributions and benefits paid in respect of the persons to whom the unemployment books or cards relate;\n(c) the issue, sale, custody, production and delivery up of unemployment books or cards and the replacement of unemployment books or cards which have been lost, destroyed or defaced; and\n(d) the offering of reward for the return of an unemployment book or card which has been lost and for the recovery from the person responsible for the custody of the book or card at the time of its loss of any reward paid for the return thereof.\nBy section 31, the failure to pay any contribution which an employer or an employee is liable to pay under the Act is constituted an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. By section 35 (1) it is provided:\nThe Minister of Finance shall from time to time deposit in the Bank of Canada, to the credit of the Commission, in an account to be called \u201cThe Unemployment Insurance Fund\u201d (hereinafter referred to as \u201cThe Fund\u201d), all revenue received from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps and all contributions, if any, paid otherwise than by means of such stamps (including contributions recovered by process of law) under the provisions of this part of this Act.\nThe Governor General in Council, by section 18 (1) is authorized to make regulations touching the payment and collection of contributions payable under the Act. This section (35 (1)) which in unqualified terms lays upon the Minister of Finance the duty to pay into the Fund \u201call revenue received from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps and all contributions and all contributions (if any) paid otherwise than by means of such stamps (including those recovered by process of law)\u201d manifests very clearly the intention that the compulsory contributions shall be paid to the government and shall be recoverable by process of law; although it is left to the Governor General in Council to make specific provision by regulation for the collection and payment of such contributions.\nNow let it be observed, in the first place, that on the hypothesis on which we are proceeding, if the monies raised by these compulsory contributions are monies raised \u201cby any mode or system of taxation,\u201d these enactments are within the powers of Parliament, but, if the attack upon the legislation is well founded, Parliament has no authority to obtain money in this way. It would appear that, having regard to the nature of the legislative authority vested in Parliament, and to the wide discretion reposed in Parliament touching the manner in which monies are to be raised under subdivision 3, a court ought to observe a high degree of caution in pronouncing upon the invalidity of an enactment, by which monies become by compulsion of law payable by individuals to the Dominion Treasury for a public purpose, on the ground that, in truth, it does not possess its prima facie character, that of a taxing statute, but is legislation intending to do what Parliament has otherwise no manner of authority to do. We are disposed to think that something approaching a demonstration ought to be required to lead one to such a conclusion.\nLet it not be overlooked that we are not here dealing with an attempt on the part of Parliament to do something it has no power to do. We have not before us an attempt under the guise of taxation to regulate insurance contracts, or an attempt under the guise of criminal legislation to regulate insurance contracts, or an attempt under the guise of legislation for the regulation of mines to regulate in relation to aliens. The statute before us has nothing of that character. If we are right in what we have already said, it is entirely competent to Parliament to resort, as sources for the provision of the unemployment fund, to taxes levied on employers and employees and to taxes levied \u201cby any mode or system\u201d which Parliament in its discretion may adopt.\nWe ask ourselves then, What are the indicia in this statute which compel us to conclude that Parliament, instead of resorting to taxation which it had authority to do, has resorted to legislation in regard to civil rights which it had no authority to enact?\nThe essentials of taxation are present. The contributions are levied by Parliament directly. That the contributions are to be paid by revenue stamps is prescribed by Parliament; but the Governor General in Council is to regulate payment and collection. Payment is compulsory. Contributions are recoverable by process of law and failure to pay is an offence punishable by fine and imprisonment. The contributions are payable into the public treasury of the Dominion, and are to be paid by the Minister of Finance into a fund which is to be applied as directed by Parliament. In Lower Mainland v. Crystal Dairy[3] Lord Thankerton, speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said:\u2014\nIn the opinion of their Lordships, the adjustment levies are taxes. They are compulsorily imposed by a statutory Committee consisting of three members, one of whom is appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the other two being appointed by the dairy farmers within the district under s. 6 of the Act. They are enforceable by law, and a certificate in writing under the hand of the chairman of the Committee is to be prima facie evidence in all Courts that such amount is due by the dairy farmer (s. 11). A dairy farmer who fails to comply with every determination, order or regulation made by Committee under the Act is to be guilty of an offence against the Act (s. 13) and to be liable to a fine under s. 19. Compulsion is an essential feature of taxation: City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works, Ltd.[4]. Their Lordships are of opinion that the Committee is a public authority, and that the imposition of these levies is for public purposes. Under s. 22 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council has power to suspend the functions of a Committee, if its operations are adversely affecting the interests of consumers of milk or manufactured products, and the Committee is to report annually to the Minister and to send him every three months the auditor\u2019s report on their accounts (s. 12, subs. 2, and s. 8A). The fact that the moneys so recovered are distributed as a bonus among the traders in the manufactured products market does not, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, affect the taxing character of the levies made.\nThe judgment of the majority of this Court in Lawson v. Interior Tree, Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[5] is to the same effect,\nIn Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[6], assessments upon employers, for the purpose of providing an accident fund out of which compensation was payable by the Compensation Board to persons injured by accident in the course of their employment and to dependents in case of death, were held to fall within the denomination \u201cdirect taxation\u201d within the meaning of section 92 (2) of the British North America Act.\nSubsection 3 of section 17 and subsection 1 of section 33 require notice in this connection. As to the first of these enactments, the subject does not appear to admit of extended argument, but we ourselves are unable to perceive any valid reason for holding that the authority to make laws in relation to the \u201craising of money by any mode or system of taxation\u201d does not embrace the authority to require \u201cA\u201d to pay in the first instance a tax in respect of which \u201cB\u201d is liable, and to give \u201cA\u201d a right to reimbursement from \u201cB\u201d out of \u201cB\u2019s\u201d monies in \u201cA\u2019s\u201d hands, or otherwise.\nAs to section 33, we are disposed to think that the provision in question, although unusual, is not beyond the power of Parliament to enact as an additional means for insuring the payment of contributions by employers and the satisfactory working of the scheme. However that may be, that provision is plainly severable. It is not a necessary part of the legislative scheme. Assuming it to be ultra vires and to afford some evidence of an intention on the part of Parliament to legislate for regulating the relations between employer and employee, such evidence is not sufficiently powerful to deprive the legislation of its prima facie character, which, as we have said, is that of an enactment in respect of the subject matter of head no. 3 of section 91.\nThere remains the broad contention that the provisions of the statute viewed as a whole disclose a scheme under which a statutory contract arises imposing upon employers and employees a contractual duty to contribute to an insurance fund and conferring upon insured persons contractual rights to be paid unemployment benefits out of that fund when the statutory prerequisites are observed.\nIn Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[7], it was held, as we have seen, that the assessments levied upon employers in order to provide an accident fund out of which compensation was to be paid to employees injured by accident were in the nature of taxes.\nTheir Lordships\u2019 Board in that case had to consider a section of the Compensation Act under which, where the accident happened on a ship or a railway outside the province, and the workman was a resident of the province, and the nature of the employment was such that the work or service performed by the workman had to be performed both within and without the province, the workman or his dependents should be entitled to recover compensation if the circumstances were such that he would have possessed such a right had the accident happened within the province. It was held that it was competent to the provincial legislature to give such a right of recovery in such circumstances, as a statutory condition of the contract of employment made with a workman resident within the province.\nThis right, it was said, arises, not out of tort, but out of the workman\u2019s statutory contract, and, it was added, their Lordships think it is a legitimate provincial object to secure that every workman resident within the province who so contracts should possess it as a benefit conferred on himself as a subject of the province.\nThe statute also provides that in any case where compensation was payable in respect of an accident happening elsewhere than in the province, if the employer had not contributed fully to the accident fund in respect of his workmen engaged in the service in which the accident happened, the employer should pay to the Board the full amount of the compensation payable in respect of the accident, and that the payment of this sum should be enforceable in the same manner as an assessment. As regards this provision, their Lordships observed:\n* * * it also appears to them to be within the power of the province to enact that, if the employer does not fully contribute to the accident fund out of which the payment is normally to be made, the employer should make good to that fund the amount required for giving effect to the title to compensation which the workman acquired for himself and his dependents.\nThe question before their Lordships concerned the competence of the provincial legislature under the powers vested in it by section 92 to enact this legislation. A ship, the property of the C.P.R. Co., had been lost at sea outside Canadian territorial waters, and it was argued, on behalf of the respondent company, that the right the legislature professed to give the workman in such circumstances, and the liability the legislation professed to impose upon the owner of the ship, was necessarily a right and a liability having a situs outside the province, and consequently not within the authority of the province to create, in exercise of its jurisdiction concerning \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d within the province. This argument was based mainly, if not exclusively, upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Royal Bank v. The King[8].\nThe judgment does not in terms state that the liability of the ship owner, where he has not fully contributed to the accident fund in respect of the employees engaged in the service in which the accident occurred, to make good such contribution in the manner mentioned was a liability arising out of the statutory term attached to the contract. The liability to pay assessments in the first instance is treated as a liability to pay a tax. As to the special duty arising from the failure to keep up his contributions, there seems to be no reason to think it was placed upon any other footing. At p. 192[9] their Lordships point out that the fundamental question was whether or not\na contract of employment made with persons within the province has given a title to a civil right within the province to compensation.\nTheir Lordships proceed,\nThe compensation, moreover, is to be paid by the Board and not by the individual employer concerned.\nThen their Lordships observe that the C.P.R. Co., carrying on business in the province of British Columbia, is subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to enact laws within certain limits imposing civil duties upon it. There is no suggestion that the liability under this special provision is of a character different from the civil duty in respect of assessments made for the purpose of providing compensation for employees whose duties are confined to the province.\nIt will be observed that the real effect of the decision is that these matters\u2014the matter of constituting an accident fund by compulsory contributions from employers carrying on business by the province and employees resident in the province, and by an optional contribution from the provincial government, for the purpose of providing accident benefits for workmen resident in the province injured in the course of their employment\u2014that these matters may, in their provincial aspects and for the purpose of establishing such a scheme of insurance, fall within the legislative authority of the province in relation to taxation, to property and civil rights, and, it may be, in relation to matters merely local and private within the province. Such a scheme it is within the authority of any province to establish. It does not follow that it is within the authority of any province, or all the provinces combined, validly to enact the legislation or, indeed, any part of the legislation necessary to give effect to the system set up by the statute before us. It seems to me to be impossible to escape the conclusion that those parts of the enactment which concern the compulsory contributions are provisions relating to the subject of taxation. As pointed out in the Crystal Dairy case[10], and as appears from Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[11], the circumstance that the fund is to be distributed for the benefit of private individuals does not militate against the view that these contributions have the character of taxes. As already observed, the essentials of taxation are indubitably present. Moreover, a provincial enactment providing for such contributions to be paid by revenue stamps to the Dominion Government, and to be collected according to regulations prescribed by the Governor in Council, and to be applied by the Minister of Finance in a manner provided by the statute, would plainly be ultra vires. A province has, obviously, no power to pass such an enactment. The Dominion has the power if it is an enactment in relation to taxation.\nIt is of supreme importance at this point to keep in mind the fundamental principle governing the construction of the British North America Act: matters which in one aspect and for one purpose may, as subjects of legislation, fall within subdivisions of s. 92 may, in another aspect, and for another purpose, fall within section 91. A provincial legislature may require such compulsory contributions for the purpose of some scheme of unemployment insurance set up by itself in the exercise of powers of legislation which it possesses. In such a case, it would appear, from, the decisions in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.11, in the Crystal Dairy case10 and in Lawson\u2019s case[12], that such contributions have the character of taxes; and legislation with regard to them would not, therefore, fall within the category of legislation respecting civil rights within the meaning of section 92. But, even assuming that such legislation by a province could be regarded as legislation in relation to civil rights, as adding a statutory term to contracts of employment, it would appear to be extremely difficult to classify the enactments requiring the payment of the contributions now in question as belonging to the category of legislation in relation to civil rights within a province, especially in view of the provisions of the statute, already mentioned, under which the Dominion Government is the payee, and the Governor in Council possesses the power to regulate payment and collection of all contributions, and all such contributions are to be applied by the Finance Minister in the manner prescribed by the statute.\nWe find ourselves unable to conclude that, reading these provisions as a whole, these enactments requiring compulsory payments can be considered as enactments on the subject of property and civil rights within any province or within all the provinces.\nTurning now to the provisions of the statute dealing with unemployment benefits. These provisions, again, if found in a scheme of unemployment insurance set up by a province, might be regarded, as similar provisions in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[13] were regarded by the Judicial Committee, as having the effect of annexing a statutory term to contracts of employment. But one thing seems to be clear,\u2014no single province, nor all the provinces combined, could enact this legislation in the exercise of their powers in regard to civil rights within the respective provinces. The enactments constitute directions for the application of a fund constituted by contributions out of the public funds of the Dominion and no province possesses any authority to legislate in relation to the application of such a fund.\nOur conclusion, therefore, is, first, that in its main provisions this statute ought on its true construction to be sustained as a valid exercise of the powers of the Dominion Parliament under subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 91. Second, that as to many of its provisions, they are plainly outside any authority possessed by any province or all the provinces under section 92 and, in so far as they do not fall within the ambit of the subdivisions mentioned, must be embraced within the general authority of the Dominion to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nWe should add that we are unable to agree with Mr. Rowell\u2019s contention that this legislation can be supported as legislation under head no. 2 of section 91, or that, in its entirety, it falls within the ambit of the residuary clause as interpreted and applied in recent decisions which are binding upon us.\nTo summarize:\u2014\nThe aims stated in the preamble are legitimate, provided, of course, that the enactments themselves are within the ambit of the legislative powers possessed by Parliament. Reading subdivision 1 of section 91 and subdivision 3 together, the proper conclusion is that Parliament has exclusive authority to raise money by any mode or system of taxation for disposition by Parliament for any purpose for which it is competent to Parliament to apply the assets of the Dominion in virtue of subdivision 1. In effect, subdivision 1 endows the High Court of Parliament with full discretionary authority to dispose of the public assets of the Dominion, and no other court is invested with jurisdiction to examine any purported exercise of that authority with a view to pronouncing upon its validity, subject only to the rule that the courts are always entitled to determine whether, in truth, any given enactment of Parliament professing to be an exercise of a given authority is not really an enactment of that character; but one relating to a subject over which Parliament has no jurisdiction.\nThe provisions requiring compulsory contributions by employers and employed possess the essential elements of legislation respecting taxation. On their true construction, they have that character because, first, it would not be competent to a provincial legislature to enact them in the context in which they stand, which demonstrates that the contributions are exacted for the purpose of raising monies for exclusive disposition by Parliament; and, second, there is no adequate ground for holding that they are, either in purpose or in immediate effect, outside the ambit of the powers under subdivision 3.\nSo also as regards the enactments concerning the disposition of the proceeds of the levies upon employers and employed and of the contribution from the Dominion treasury. They are not enactments in respect of property and civil rights in any one province or in all of the provinces. They would not be competent as enactments by any or all of the provincial legislatures, and there is no adequate ground for affirming that these enactments are not legislation in relation to the subjects within the scope of subdivision 1.\nIt is hardly susceptible of dispute that Parliament could, in the legitimate exercise of its exclusive authority under subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 91, levy taxes for the purpose of raising money to constitute a fund to be expended in conformity with the directions of Parliament, in unemployment benefits, and provide for a contribution to that fund from the Dominion treasury, or to maintain that, in executing these exclusive powers, Parliament is subject to any control by the courts as to the form of the taxation or the incidence of it or as touching the manner or conditions of the payment of benefits.\nIt is, perhaps, not too much to say that complete discretionary authority respecting the form and incidence of taxation under subdivision 3, and respecting the disposal of all public assets under subdivision 1, are essential to enable Parliament to discharge the responsibilities entrusted to it.\nIn a word, legislation for raising money for disposition by Parliament under subdivision 3 of section 91, and directing the disposition of it under subdivision 1, is necessarily excluded from the jurisdiction of the provinces by the concluding words of section 91; and there is no sufficient ground for affirming that, in the enactments of this statute, Parliament is not exercising its powers under these subdivisions, or, in other words, that under the guise of doing so it is invading a provincial field from which it is excluded, for the purpose of attaining a result which it has full power to attain by legislating within fields in which it has exclusive authority.\nThe statue is, therefore, intra vires.\nRinfret J. (Cannon and Kerwin JJ. concurring)\u2014The constitutionality of the Employment and Social Insurance Act (see ch. 38 of the statutes of Canada, 25-26 Geo. V, assented to 28th June, 1935) was referred by the Governor in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 55 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe statute is entitled \u201cAn Act to establish an Employment and Social Insurance Commission, to provide for a National Employment Service, for Insurance against Unemployment, for aid to Unemployed Persons, and for other forms of Social Insurance and Security, and for purposes related thereto.\u201d The preamble refers to the Treaty of Peace made between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles on the 28th day of June, 1919. It states that it is desirable to discharge the obligations to Canadian Labour flowing from articles 23 and 427 of the Treaty, and that it is essential for the peace, order and good government of Canada to adopt such an Act for the purpose of maintaining on equitable terms interprovincial and international trade, to authorize the creation of a National Fund out of which benefits to unemployed persons throughout Canada will be payable and to provide for the levying of contributions from employers and workers for the maintaining of the said fund and for contributions thereto by the Dominion.\nAfter making provision for the short title and the interpretation clauses, the Act is divided into five parts. Part 1 relates to the Employment and Social Insurance Commission, which is thereby brought into existence. Part II relates to Employment service. Part III relates to Unemployment Insurance. Part IV relates to National Health. Part V contains general provisions concerning regulations; the annual report to be submitted by the Commission; all other reports, recommendations and submissions required to be made to the Governor in Council; the disposition of fines; repeal, audit and the coming into force of the Act.\nIt is followed by three schedules, the first of which defines employment within the meaning of Part III of the Act and enumerates the \u201cexcepted employments.\u201d The second schedule fixes the weekly rates of contribution and establishes the rules as to payment and recovery of compulsory payments by employers on behalf of unemployed persons. The third schedule fixes the rates of unemployment benefits.\nUnder Part I, the Act is to be administered by a Commission consisting of three members to be called the Employment and Insurance Commission, with wide powers of investigation for assisting unemployed persons and for providing to them physical and industrial training and instruction.\nUnder Part II, the Commision is to organize an Employment Service for the Dominion of Canada. The Act provides for the constitution and management of such Employment service on a very large scale. Regional divisions are established. There is to be in each such division a central employment office and as many employment offices as the Commission will deem expedient and desirable for the purposes of the Act. The Commission is to have the direction, maintenance and control of all employment offices so established. The Commission may make regulations authorizing advances by way of loans towards meeting the expenses of workers travelling to places where employment has been found for them through an employment office.\nPart III of the Act provides for Unemployment Insurance. The persons to be insured against unemployment are defined. The Act regulates the manner in which the funds required shall be collected partly from monies provided by Parliament, partly from contributions by employed persons and by the employers of those persons. But the employer shall, in the first instance, be liable to pay both the contribution payable by himself and also, on behalf of the employed person, the contribution payable by that person, subject to the right to recover by deduction from the wages or otherwise. The payment of contributions is to be made by means of revenue stamps affixed to or impressed upon books or cards specially prescribed for that purpose. There follows statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefits. One of them is that the person insured shall not be entitled to the benefit until contributions on his behalf have been made for not less than forty full weeks. The manner in which and the conditions under which the contributions are to be paid are defined in numerous sections and subsections.\nAll questions concerning the rights of persons under the Act are to be determined by the Commission. The Commission may employ insurance officers in each regional division; and the Governor in Council is further authorized to designate such number of persons as are necessary in each such division to act as umpires, deputy-umpires, courts of referees, chairmen of those courts, etc., for the purpose of examining and determining all claims for benefit, with elaborate provisions for appeal.\nThen follow a number of sections dealing with penalties, legal proceedings, civil proceedings by the employee against the employer for neglect to comply with the Act, including the authorization for the Commission to institute proceedings on behalf of the employed person, or for the recovery as civil debts of sums due to the Unemployed Insurance Fund established under the Act.\nInspectors are to be appointed for the purpose of the execution of the Act with power to do all or any of several things, including the right to enter premises other than private dwellings, to make examinations and inquiries, to examine persons and to exercise such other powers as may be necessary to carry the Act into effect.\nThen come the financial provisions. The revenue from the sale of the stamps and from all contributions are to be deposited from time to time in the Bank of Canada, by the Minister of Finance, to the credit of the Commission, in an account to be called \u201cThe Unemployment Insurance Fund.\u201d And in a similar way are to be deposited the monies provided by Parliament; and there is to be an Investment Committee of three members consisting of one member nominated by the Government, one by the Minister of Finance, and one by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, to look after the investment of such sums standing to the credit of the Fund as are not required to meet current expenditures.\nIn addition to all the above officials, there will be appointed an Advisory Committee, the duties of which are to give advice and assistance to the Commission in relation to the discharge of its functions under the Act and to make reports on the financial condition of the Fund. This Committee shall consist of a Chairman and not less than four, nor more than six, other members. Further, the Commission is given authority to make regulations relating to persons working under the same employer partly in insurable employment and partly in other occupations; also for prescribing the evidence to be required as to the fulfilment of the conditions for receiving unemployment benefits; for prescribing the manner in which claims for unemployment benefit may be made, the proceedings to be followed in the consideration and examination of claims; and also regulations with respect to the references to the central or local committees, and to persons employed on night work and to penalties for the violation of any regulation.\nUnder Part IV, the duties and powers of the Commission are defined with respect to its co-operation in matters of health and health insurance. It may undertake special investigations in regard thereto, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council.\nThe weekly rates of contribution provided for under the second schedule are graduated according to the class and the wages of the employed person. The weekly contributions are made payable for each calendar week during the whole or any part of which an employed person has been employed by an employer. The payment of contributions both by the employer and by the employee is compulsory. All conditions prescribed for the payment of these contributions including the right of the employer to recover from the employed person the amount of any contributions paid by him on behalf of the employed person are made essential and necessary conditions of the contract of engagement between the employer and the employee. In fact, Part II of the second schedule contains any number of these conditions and provides for further regulations which may be made by the Commission in connection therewith.\nThe Court is asked to give its opinion upon the question whether the Act, or any of the provisions thereof, is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe written submission of the Attorney-General of Canada was that the Act in its entirety was within the legislative power of the Parliament of Canada in virtue of\n(1) its residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, and\n(2) its exclusive power (a) to regulate trade and commerce, (b) to raise money by any mode or system of taxation, (c) to appropriate public money for any public purposes, (d) to provide for the collection of statistics; and, incidentally, (e) to enact criminal laws.\nIt is unnecessary for me to add anything to what has already been said\u2014and so well been said\u2014by my Lord the Chief Justice in connection with the other References made to the Court at the same time as the present one (more particularly those concerning the Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934 (p. 403), and the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935 (p. 381), to indicate the reasons why I think that the validity of this legislation cannot be supported as an exercise of the residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, or as an exercise of the power to regulate trade and commerce.\nInsurance of all sorts, including insurance against unemployment and health insurances, have always been recognized as being exclusively provincial matters under the head \u201cProperty and Civil Rights,\u201d or under the head \u201cMatters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\u201d By force of the British North America Act, the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada is given to the Dominion Parliament only \u201cin relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nThe exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada in regard to all matters not enumerated in section 91 was, by more than one pronouncement of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, declared to be \u201cstrictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance\u201d (Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada)[14]; it will be recognized by the Courts \u201conly after scrutiny sufficient to render it clear that circumstances are abnormal \u2026 such as cases of war or famine\u201d[15]; and \u201cinstances of these cases \u2026 are highly exceptional\u201d[16].\nIn this particular matter, there is no evidence of an emergency amounting to national peril; but, moreover and still more important, the statute is not meant to provide for an emergency. It is not, on its face, intended to cope with a temporary national peril; it is a permanent statute dealing with normal conditions of employment. There was accordingly here no occasion, nor foundation, for the exercise of the residuary power. Nor is this legislation for the regulation of trade and commerce. It is not trade and commerce as defined by the Privy Council in its numerous decisions upon the subject. It deals with a great many matters which are trade and commerce in no sense of the word, such as the contract of employment, employment service, unemployment insurance and benefit, and health.\nThe proposition that the Act could be supported in virtue of the powers of the Dominion Parliament derived from Head 6 (Statistics), or Head 27 (Criminal Law) of section 91 need not retain our attention and it was not pressed at the argument.\nIt may be stated further that the legislation is not based on the Treaty of Peace, although it is referred to in the preamble. In fact, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada positively stated at bar that he was not relying on any treaty or on section 132 of the British North America Act.\nThere remains, therefore, in the submission made on behalf of the Dominion Government, only two heads that have to be considered in support of the legislation; and they are: \u201cthe power to raise money by any mode or system of taxation\u201d (91-3), and \u201cthe power to appropriate public moneys for any public purpose.\u201d\nIn truth, these powers were only faintly advanced by counsel for the Dominion in favour of the legislation Nevertheless, they were referred to, and more particularly as I understand that they were accepted in support of the validity of the Act by my Lord the Chief Justice, I realize that my reasons for holding a different view must be explained as fully, though as concisely, as possible.\nThe critical question is whether or not the statute is, in its substance, an exercise of those powers to raise money by taxation and to make laws for the disposal of the public property.\nAt the outset, let us remember the remark of Lord Coke (4 Inst. 330) that the preamble of a statute is \u201cthe key to open the minds of the makers of the Act and the mischiefs which they intended to remedy.\u201d\nThe recitals of the preamble have already been referred to. They mention the Treaty of Versailles and the promise of the signatories to endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for industrial wage earners. They indicate the desirability of discharging certain obligations to Canadian Labour. They invoke the importance for the peace, order and good government of Canada to provide for a National employment service, for insurance against unemployment and for other forms of social insurance. They allege the necessity of maintaining on equitable terms interprovincial and international trade. They mention the purpose of creating a national fund, out of which benefits to unemployed persons throughout Canada will be payable, and of providing for the levy of contributions from employers and workers for the maintaining of this fund and for contribution thereto by the Dominion.\nWith deference, it seems to me that these recitals clearly indicate that the Parliament of Canada intended primarily to legislate with regard to employment service, to unemployment insurance, and to health matters; that it was not concerned with the public debt and property or with the raising of money by taxation; and that the provisions for levying contributions for the creation of the national fund were nothing more than provisions to enable the carrying out of the true and only purposes of the legislation. The Act is one dealing with and regulating employment service and unemployment insurance. The contributions (or the taxes, if we are to call them so) are mere incidents of the regulation.\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat that, when investigating whether an Act was competently passed by Parliament, the courts must ascertain the \u201ctrue nature and character\u201d of the enactment, its \u201cpith and substance,\u201d and the legislation must be \u201cscrutinized in its entirety\u201d for the purpose of determining within which of the categories of subject-matters mentioned in sections 91 and 92 the legislation falls (Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[17]; Union Colliery Company v. Bryden[18]; Great West Saddlery Company v. The King[19]; Reciprocal Insurers case[20]; Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[21]. In my humble view, the subject-matter of the Act is employment service and social insurance, not public debt and property or taxation. The object of the Act, the end sought to be accomplished by it is a scheme for employment service and unemployment insurance; the contributions levied from the employers and employees are only incidents of the proposed scheme, and, in fact, merely means of carrying it into effect. The Act does not possess the character of a taxing statute, but it is legislation intending to do precisely what the title says: to establish an employment insurance commission, to provide for a national employment service, for insurance against unemployment, for aid to unemployed persons, or other forms of social insurance and security and for purposes related thereto.\nIt being well understood and, in fact, conceded that these are subject-matters falling within the legislative authority of the provinces, the Dominion Parliament may not, under pretext of the exercise of the power to deal with its property, or to raise money by taxation, indirectly accomplish the ends sought for in this legislation. If it were otherwise, the Dominion Parliament, under colour of the taxing power, would be permitted to invade almost any of the fields exclusively reserved by the Constitution to the legislatures in each province.\nOne of the effects of the Act under submission is, in the language of Lord Haldane, in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[22], \u201cto attach statutory terms to contracts of employment,\u201d and to impose contractual duties as between employers and employees. In its immediate result, the Act creates civil rights as between the former and the latter.\nI doubt whether the contribution received from the employee can properly be described as a tax. In fact, it would seem to me to partake more of the nature of an insurance premium or of a payment for services and individual benefits which are to be returned to the employee in proportion to his payments. Be that as it may under all circumstances, the benefits conferred on the employees by the Act are not gifts with conditions attached, which the employees are free to accept or not; the conditions attached to the benefits are made compulsory terms of all contracts in the specified employments, and I deprecate the idea that the Dominion Parliament may use its power of taxation to compel the insertion of conditions of that character in ordinary contracts between employers and employees.\nIt may be that some of the provisions of the Act are not open to objection. But I fail to see how they can be severed from the general scheme organized under the Act or from the powers conferred on the Commission; and the legislation as it stands must undoubtedly fall as a whole.\nIn the premises, the Act submitted to the Court is not a mere encroachment on the provincial fields through the exercise of powers allegedly ancillary or incidental to one of the enumerated powers of section 91; in its pith and substance, it is a direct and unwarranted appropriation of the powers attributed to the legislatures by force of Section 92 of the Constitution.\nFor these reasons, and also for the reasons given by my brother Kerwin, with whom I entirely concur, I have come to the conclusion that the Employment and Social Insurance Act (chapter 38 of the statutes of Canada, 25-26 Geo. V) is wholly ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nCrocket, J.\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Rinfret, I agree that the above statute is wholly ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nKerwin J. (Rinfret and Cannon JJ. concurring)\u2014The Governor General in Council has referred to this Court for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act the following question: \u201cIs the Employment and Social Insurance Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\u201d\nSection 1 of the Act merely gives its short title; section 2 is the interpretation section, while section 3 provides that the remainder of the Act may be referred to as follows: Part I, sections four to nine inclusive, relating to the Employment and Social Insurance Commission;\nPart II, sections ten to fourteen inclusive relating to Employment Service;\nPart III, sections fifteen to thirty-eight inclusive relating to Unemployment Insurance;\nPart IV, sections thirty-nine to forty-one inclusive relating to National Health;\nPart V, sections forty-two to forty-eight inclusive, General.\nThe sections included in Part II provide that The Employment and Social Insurance Commission constituted under Part I shall organize an employment service for the Dominion of Canada, and contain supplementary provisions for the collection of information, advances to workers seeking employment, etc.\nThe sections included in Part IV enact that the duties and powers of the Commission under that Part shall be exercised so far as may be found practicable and expedient in co-operation with any department or departments of the Government of Canada, with the Dominion Council of Health, with any province or any number of provinces collectively, or with any municipality or any number of municipalities collectively, or with associations or corporations, and provide that it shall be the duty of the Commission to assemble reports, publications, etc, concerning certain schemes or plans for medicinal, dental or surgical care, including medicines, drugs or hospitalization, or compensation for loss of earnings arising out of ill-health, accident or disease.\nBy themselves the provisions of Part II and of certain portions of Parts IV and V might be unobjectionable but in my opinion they are so inextricably interwoven with the powers of the Commission set up under Part I and with the scheme of unemployment insurance referred to in Part III that they must stand or fall according to the validity or otherwise of sections 15 to 38 inclusive which form Part III.\nAs to Part III serious questions arise. In addition to the arguments of counsel, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of My Lord the Chief Justice but with deference I find myself unable to agree with the conclusions expressed therein that this Part of the Act may be justified as an exercise by Parliament of its powers under Head 1 \u201cThe Public Debt and Property\u201d and Head 2 \u201cThe Raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\u201d of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867. It is quite true that Parliament, by properly framed legislation may raise money by taxation and dispose of its public property in any manner that it sees fit. As to the latter point, it is evident that the Dominion may grant sums of money to individuals or organizations and that the gift may be accomplished by such restrictions and conditions as Parliament may see fit to enact. It would then be open to the proposed recipient to decline the gift or to accept it subject to such conditions. As to the first point, it is also undoubted, I conceive, that Parliament, by properly framed legislation may raise money by taxation, and this may be done either generally or for the specific purpose of providing the funds wherewith to make grants either before or after the conferring of the benefit.\nBut in my view, after a careful consideration of all the sections in Part III of the Act, in substance Parliament does not purport to do either of these things. Section 15 provides that the designated persons, referred to as \u201cunemployed persons\u201d shall be insured against unemployment in the manner provided for by the Act. Section 17 enacts that the funds required for providing \u201cunemployment benefit\u201d and for making any other payments which are to be made out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund established later under Part III shall be derived partly from moneys provided by Parliament, partly from contributions from employed persons and partly from contributions from employers of those persons, which contributions shall be paid by means of revenue stamps or otherwise as may be prescribed by the Commission. Rates of contribution are set forth in the second schedule to the Act, and by ss. 3 of s. 17 except where regulations under the Act otherwise prescribe, the employer shall in the first instance be liable to pay both the contribution payable by himself and also the contribution payable by the employed person with power to the employer, subject to regulations, to recover from the employed persons to the amount of the contributions so paid on behalf of the latter by the employer. By section 19 every unemployed insured person who complies with prescribed \u201cstatutory conditions\u201d is entitled to receive what is known as an \u201cunemployment benefit.\u201d There is a provision by which certain employed persons may be exempted from the provisions of the Act, but subject to that, the individuals covered by this Part are obliged to become insured by means of a statutory condition attached to the contract of employment.\nWhile there are numerous other provisions, I believe I have correctly set forth the marrow of Part III of the Act and I am unable to ascertain in what maner they may be termed an exercise of the power conferred upon Parliament to tax. It occurs to me that if it were otherwise the Parliament of Canada might in connection with any matter whatsoever, by the mere imposition of a tax, confer upon itself authority to legislate upon matters over which the legislature of each province would ordinarily have jurisdiction. This must be understood, of course, as not referring to any power in the legislatures of the various provinces to originate or assist its local scheme by indirect taxation.\nThat, with this qualification, the subject matter of Part III would ordinarily fall within the ambit of the powers of the provinces within their respective boundaries was not, I think seriously disputed. It deals with contracts of employment and attaches thereto a statutory condition. It interferes with property and civil rights. A reference particularly to section 15 and to the recitals in the Act indicates that the very pith and substance of this part of the Act deals with unemployment insurance.\nIn re The Insurance Act of Canada[23] was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec in answer to the following questions referred to that Court by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province:\n1. Is a foreign or British insurer who holds a licence under the Quebec Insurance Act to carry on business within the Province obliged to observe and subject to ss. 11, 12, 65 and 66 of the Insurance Act of Canada, or are these sections unconstitutional as regards such insurer?\n2. Are ss. 16, 20 and 21 of the Special War Revenue Act within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada? Would there be any difference between the case of an insurer who has obtained or is bound to obtain under the Provincial law a licence to carry on business in the Province and any other case?\nIn delivering the judgment of their Lordships, Viscount Dunedin after referring to Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta[24], and stating that that decision conclusively and finally settled that regulations as to the carrying on of insurance business were a provincial and not a Dominion matter, concluded: \u201cIt really only carried to their logical conclusion the two cases already cited\u201d; the two cases being Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[25] and John Deere Plow Company\u2019s case[26]. He then discussed the Reciprocal Insurers case[27], pointing out that the Board had there decided that section 508C of the Criminal Code was not a genuine amendment of the criminal law, but was really an attempt by a soi-disant amendment of the criminal law to subject insurance business in the Province to the control of the Dominion\u2014that which had exactly been determined to be ultra vires the Dominion by the judgment of 1916. Their Lordships therefore in the 1931 case decided that the first part of question 1 should be answered in the negative. They then proceeded to the second question and quoted the only section of the Special War Revenue Act that in their opinion needed to be considered. That section was as follows:\n16. Every person resident in Canada, who insures his property situate in Canada, or any property situate in Canada in which he has an insurable interest, other than that of an insurer of such property, against risks other than marine risks: (a) with any British or foreign company or British or foreign underwriter or underwriters, not licensed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, to transact business in Canada; or (b) with any association of persons formed for the purpose of exchanging reciprocal contracts of indemnity upon the plan known as inter-insurance and not licensed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, the chief place of business of which association or of its principal attorney-in-fact is situate outside of Canada; shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year pay to the Minister, in addition to any other tax payable under any existing law or statute a tax of five per centum of the total net cost to such person of all such insurance for the preceding calendar year.\nThe judgment continues:\nNow as to the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose taxation there is no doubt. But if the tax as imposed is linked up with an object which is illegal the tax for that purpose must fall.\nOn page 53 Viscount Dunedin quoted the following extract from the judgment of the Board in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case27:\nIn accordance with the principle inherent in these decisions their Lordships think it is no longer open to dispute that the Parliament of Canada cannot, by purporting to create penal sections under s. 91, head 27, appropriate to itself exclusively a field of jurisdiction in which, apart from such a procedure, it could exert no legal authority, and that if, when examined as a whole, legislation in form criminal is found, in aspects and for purposes exclusively within the Provincial sphere, to deal with matters committed to the Provinces, it cannot be upheld as valid.\nHe then continued:\u2014\nIf instead of the words \u201ccreate penal sanctions under s. 91, head 27\u201d you substitute the words \u201cexercise taxation powers under s. 91, head 3,\u201d and for the word \u201ccriminal\u201d substitute \u201ctaxing,\u201d the sentence expresses precisely their Lordships\u2019 views.\nIf this be the case where the Court decides that Parliament has colourably invaded the field of provincial jurisdiction, how much more cogent is the reasoning if one comes to the conclusion that the legislation in question does not even purport to be a taxing Act.\nIn the present reference that is the conclusion to which I am impelled and it follows that in my view Part III may not be justified under either of the heads of section 91 of the British North America Act to which I have referred. For the reasons already given the remainder of the Act is in the same position.\nElsewhere in his consideration of other Acts referred at this time to this Court, my Lord the Chief Justice has dealt exhaustively with the powers of Parliament under the residuary clause of s. 91 of the British North America Act and also with the powers of the Dominion under head 2, \u201cThe Regulation of Trade and Commerce,\u201d of that section. It is unnecessary, therefore, for me to refer to the decisions and I content myself with expressing the opinion that even if the object aimed at by Part III of the present Act may be praiseworthy and if the desired result might better be obtained by the Dominion than all or some of the provinces acting within their constitutional limitations might accomplish, the matter is not translated from the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature to that of Parliament. In the same way I am unable to see how, in view of the summary of the powers of the Dominion with reference to trade and commerce also given elsewhere by the learned Chief Justice, the matter could be considered as falling within that head of section 91.\nFor these reasons, and for the reasons given by my brother Rinfret which I have had the opportunity of perusing, I have come to the conclusion that the Act in toto is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\n* Reporter\u2019s note: Counsel on the argument of this Reference were the same as those mentioned at p. 365.\n[1] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[2] (1888) 14 A.C. 46.\n[3] [1933] A.C. 168.\n[4] [1914] A.C. 992. at 998.\n[5] [1931] S.C.R. 357 at 362.\n[6] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[7] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[8] [1913] A.C. 283.\n[9] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[10] [1933] A.C. 168.\n[11] [1920] A.C. 184.\n11 [1920] A.C. 184.\n10 [1933] A.C. 168.\n[12] [1931] S.C.R. 357.\n[13] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[14] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[15] [1922] 1 A.C. 200.\n[16] [1923] A.C. 695; [1925] A.C. 396.\n[17] (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96.\n[18] [1899] A.C. 580.\n[19] [1921] 2 A.C. 91, at 117.\n[20] [1924] A.C. 328, at p. 337.\n[21] [1925] A.C. 396, at p. 407.\n[22] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[23] [1932] A.C. 41.\n[24] [1916] 1 A.C. 588.\n[25] [1881] 7 A.C. 96.\n[26] [1915] A.C. 330.\n[27] [1924] A.C. 328.\n27 [1924] A.C. 328.\n",

Act, s. 132\u2014Property and civil rights\u2014B.N.A. Act. s. 92.\nThe Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, which gave effect to the Draft Convention of the International Labour Conference on that subject, applies to industrial undertakings as defined in art. 1 of the Draft Convention, and requires employers to grant a rest period of at least twenty-four consecutive hours in every seven days to all employees, with the exception of persons who hold positions of supervision or management or who are employed in a confidential capacity. The rest period is, wherever possible, to be granted to the whole staff simultaneously, and to coincide with the Lord\u2019s Day as defined by the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 123. The Minimum Wages Act is designed to give effect to the provisions of the Draft Convention concerning the creation of minimum wage-fixing machinery adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1928. By s. 4 (1), the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, may create and by regulation provide for the operation, by or under the Minister, of machinery whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed for workers in specified rateable trades. Employers and workers concerned are to be associated in the operation of such machinery in such manner as the Governor in Council may by regulation determine, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms. \u201cRateable trades\u201d are defined in accordance with the terms of the Convention as \u201cthose trades or parts of trades (in particular, home-working trades) in which no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low.\u201d \u201cTrade\u201d includes manufacture and commerce and \u201cworker\u201d includes any employed person not under 16 years of age. By s. 4 (2), Minimum wages so fixed are to be binding on employers and workers concerned so as not to be subject to abatement by means of individual agreement, or, except with the general or particular authorization of the Minister, by collective agreement. The Limitation of Hours of Work Act gives effect to the Draft Convention of the International Labour Conference adopted in 1919, limiting hours of work in industrial undertakings as defined in article 1 of the Convention.\nHeld, per Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ., that these Acts are intra vires of the Parliament of Canada; per Rinfret, Cannon and Crocket JJ., that they are ultra vires.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ.\u2014From two main considerations, the conclusion follows that legislative authority in respect of international agreements is, as regards Canada, vested exclusively in the Parliament of Canada. First, by virtue of section 132 of the British North America Act, jurisdiction, legislative and executive, for the purpose of giving effect to any treaty obligation imposed upon Canada, or any one of the provinces of Canada, by force of a treaty between the British Empire and a foreign country, is committed to the Parliament and Government of Canada. This jurisdiction of the Dominion the Privy Council held, in the Aeronautics case and in the Radio case ([1932] A.C. 54 and 304) is exclusive; and consequently, under the British North America Act, the provinces have no power and never had power to legislate for the purpose of giving effect to an international agreement: that, as a subject of legislation, is excluded from the jurisdiction envisaged by section 92. Second, as a result of the constitutional development of the last thirty years (and more particularly of the last twenty years) Canada has acquired the status of an international unit, that is to say, she has been recognized by His Majesty the King, by the other nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and by the nations of the world, as possessing a status enabling her to enter into, on her own behalf, international arrangements, and to incur obligations under such arrangements. These arrangements may take various forms. They may take the form of treaties, in the strict sense, between heads of states, to which His Majesty the King is formally a party. They may take, inter alia, the form of agreements between governments, in which His Majesty does not formally appear, Canada being represented by the Governor General in Council or by a delegate or delegates authorized directly by him. Whatever the form of the agreement, it is now settled that, as regards Canada, it is the Canadian Government acting on its own responsibility to the Parliament of Canada which deals with the matter. If the international contract is in the form of a treaty between heads of states, His Majesty acts, as regards Canada, on the advice of His Canadian Government.\nNecessarily, in virtue of the fundamental principles of our constitution, the Canadian Government in exercising these functions is under the control of Parliament. Parliament has full power by legislation to determine the \u00abconditions under which international agreements may be entered into and to provide for giving effect to them. That this authority is exclusive would seem to follow inevitably from the circumstances that the Lieutenant-Governors of the provinces do not in any manner represent His Majesty in external affairs, and that the provincial governments are not concerned with such affairs; the effect of the two decisions above referred to is that in all these matters the authority of Parliament is not merely paramount, but exclusive. The first of the two cardinal questions raised by the contentions of the provinces has two branches, and may be stated thus: Has Parliament authority to legislate for carrying out a treaty or convention or agreement with a foreign country containing stipulations to which effect can only be given by domestic legislation changing the law of the provinces (a) in matters committed by the British North America Act (in the absence of any such international agreement) to the legislatures of the provinces exclusively, and (b) in relation to such matters where they are ex facie of domestic concern only and not of international concern, such, for example, as the matters dealt with by the conventions to which effect is given by the statutes now before the Court: the regulation of wages and of hours of labour.\nThe view that the exclusive authority of Parliament extends to international treaties and agreements relating to such subjects rests on the grounds now outlined. (1) As touching the view advanced that the subject-matters of the stipulations in the international agreements in question are of exclusively domestic and not at all of international concern: the language of section 132 B.N.A. Act is unqualified and that section would appear prima facie to extend to any treaty with a foreign country in relation to any subject-matter which in contemplation, of the rules of constitutional law respecting the royal prerogative concerning treaties would be a legitimate subject-matter for a treaty; and there would appear to be no authority for the proposition that treaties in relation to subjects, such as the subject-matter of the status in question\u2019 are not within the scope of that prerogative. Legislative authority to give effect to treaties within section 132 remained, of course, after the B.N.A. Act, down to the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in the Imperial Parliament, although by section 132, it also became and is vested in the Parliament of Canada; but, since the Statute of Westminster, no Act of the Imperial Parliament can have effect in Canada without the consent of Canada. The practice of modern times and, in particular, the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations embodied in the Treaty of Versailles would appear to demonstrate that by common consent of the nations of the world, such matters are regarded as of high international as well as of domestic concern and proper subjects for treaty stipulation. (2) As touching the view that the legislative authority committed to the Parliament and Government of Canada by section 132 (and by the introductory clause of section 91 in relation to international matters) does not extend to matters which would fall exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, in the absence of any international obligation respecting them, it is to be observed: First, section 132 relates inter alia to obligations imposed upon any province of Canada by any treaty between the British Empire and a foreign country. Section 132 obviously contemplates the possibility of such an obligation arising as a diplomatic obligation under such a treaty, even although legislation might be necessary in order to attach to it the force of law. In such case, the Parliament and Government of Canada appear to be endowed with the necessary legislative and executive powers. This provision with regard to the obligations of the provinces taken together with the generality of the language employed in section 132 would seem to point rather definitely to the conclusion that the view under consideration is not tenable. Secondly, the established practice of the Parliament of Canada and the decisions of the Courts in relation to that practice do not accord with this view. Statutes giving effect to the International Waterways Treaty (1911) with the United States, and the Treaty with Japan (1913) are instances in which treaties dealing with matters of civil right within the provinces and the management of the public property of the provinces were given the force of law by Dominion statutes. The legislation concerning the Japanese Treaty was held to be valid and to nullify a statute of the province inconsistent with it by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada, ([1924] A.C. 203).\nThe jurisdiction of Parliament to enforce international obligations under agreements which are not strictly \u201ctreaties\u201d within section 132 is co-ordinate with the jurisdiction under this last named section.\nIt is contended by the provinces that the Dominion cannot, by reason merely of the existence of an international agreement (within section 132 or within the residuary clause) possess legislative authority enabling the Parliament of Canada to legislate in derogation of certain fundamental terms which, it is said, were the basis of the Union of 1867, and are expressly or impliedly embodied in the B.N.A. Act. For the purposes of the present reference, it is unnecessary to make any observation upon this contention further than what has already been said, viz., that the exclusive authority of the Dominion to give the force of law to an international agreement is not affected by the circumstances alone that, in the absence of such an agreement, the exclusive legislative authority of the provinces would extend to the subject matter of it.\nThe second of the cardinal questions requiring determination concerns the construction and effect of article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles.\nThe draft conventions now in question were brought before the House of Commons and the Senate, received the assent of both Houses in the form of resolutions, which resolutions approved the ratification of them, and the statutes in question were passed for the purpose of giving legislative effect to their stipulations, the operative clauses of the statute being in each case preceded by a preamble in which it is recited that the draft conventions have been ratified by Canada. The procedure followed, if we put aside the provisions of article 405, was the usual and proper procedure for engaging in and giving effect to agreements with foreign governments. The propriety of this procedure is questioned on the ground that under the special provisions of article 405, and especially those of paragraphs 5 and 7 of the article, it was an essential condition of the jurisdiction of Parliament to legislate for the enforcement of the conventions that the conventions should have been submitted to, and should have received the assent of, the provincial legislatures before the enactment of such legislation by Parliament.\nParagraphs 5 and 7 must be read together and, reading them together, it would appear that the \u201ccompetence\u201d postulated is the \u201ccompetence\u201d to enact legislation or to take other \u201caction\u201d contemplated by the article.\nThe obligations upon consent of the competent authority or authorities to ratify and, upon like consent after ratification, \u201cto make effective the provisions of the convention\u201d are both treaty obligations; and the authority or authorities competent to take legislative action where legislative action may be necessary to make the provisions of the convention effective would appear plainly to be included within the authority or authorities before whom it is provided that the draft conventions shall be brought.\nIt follows from what has been said that this treaty obligation is an obligation within section 132 and, consequently, that the authority to make the convention effective exclusively rests in the Parliament and Government of Canada and therefore, that the Parliament of Canada is, at least, one of the authorities before which the convention must be brought under the terms of article\u2019 405. The provincial legislatures may also be competent authorities within the contemplation of paragraph 5 of that article, but it is unnecessary to decide that question for the purposes of this reference.\nThe Governor General in Council is designated by the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, enacted under the authority of section 132, to take all such measures as may seem to him to be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Treaties of Peace and for giving effect to the terms of such treaties. He it was, therefore, upon whom devolved the duty of performing the obligation of Canada under art. 405 to bring the draft convention before the authority or authorities possessing \u201ccompetence\u201d under the Constitution of Canada. He it was also on whom devolved the duty to communicate to the League of Nations the ratification by Canada upon the assent of the competent authority or authorities. Moreover, the Parliament of Canada, possessing exclusive jurisdiction in relation to international agreements, the creation as well as the enforcement of them, declared, by the statutes now under examination, that the conventions in question were ratified by Canada. The executive authority, therefore, charged with the duty of acting for Canada in performing the treaty obligations, of submitting the conventions to the proper constitutional authorities and of communicating ratification to the League of Nations upon the assent of those authorities, and His Majesty the King in Parliament have, in effect, combined in declaring that the ratification was assented to by the proper constitutional authorities of Canada in conformity with the stipulations of art. 405. That would appear to be sufficient to constitute a diplomatic obligation binding upon Canada to observe the provisions of the conventions.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014Apart from any consideration resulting from their aspect as laws intended to carry out the obligations of Canada under Draft Conventions agreed upon at general conferences of the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations, the subject-matter of these Acts is undoubtedly one in relation to which, under the Constitution of our country, the legislature in each province may exclusively make laws. It follows that, in order to support the validity of the Acts, the Attorney-General of Canada has the burden of demonstrating that, in the premises, the subject-matter of the disputed legislation has, for some special reason, been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Acts cannot be supported as an exercise of the (legislative powers of the Dominion either to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, or for the regulation of trade and commerce, or in relation to the criminal law. These conventions are not treaties within the meaning of section 132 of the B.N.A. Act, such as was the case in the Aeronautics Reference to the Privy Council ([1932] A.C. 54); nor are they conventions belonging to that class of conventions submitted to the Privy Council in the Radio Reference ([1932] A.C. 304). So that the judgments of the Privy Council in those two References do not constitute authorities in support of the Dominion Government\u2019s or the Dominion Parliament\u2019s power to act alone in the performance of the obligations deriving from conventions of the present character.\nBesides that, both in the Aeronautics and in the Radio references, the Privy Council, at the same time as it declared that the validity of the legislation in respect thereto could be supported as an exercise of the power derived from section 132, B.N.A. Act, or from the residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the country, also came to the conclusion) that the subject of aeronautics and the subject of radio came under one or more of the enumerated heads of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, which is not the case here.\nBut the critical point in the present reference is whether the Draft Conventions were competently ratified\u2014a point which was not raised nor decided in the Aeronautics or Radio references.\nA very great distinction must be made between the power to create an international obligation and the power to perform it when once it has been created.\nUnder the distribution of legislative powers, the subject matters of the three Acts now submitted are assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature in each province under the head \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province,\u201d of section 92, B.N.A. Act. A civil right does not change its nature just because it becomes the subject matter of a convention with a foreign state. It is always the same civil right. It is not within the spirit of the Constitution that the Dominion Parliament might acquire exclusive jurisdiction over such matters merely as a consequence of the fact that the Dominion Government, in regard to them, decides to enter into a convention with a foreign power. It would be directly against the intendment of the B.N.A. Act that the King or the Governor General of Canada should enter into an international agreement dealing with matters exclusively assigned to the jurisdiction of the provinces solely upon the advice of the Federal Ministers who, either by themselves or through the instrumentality of the Dominion Parliament, are prohibited by the Constitution from assuming jurisdiction over these matters.\nMoreover, article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles must be interpreted as requiring, in Canada, the consent and approval of the provinces before Draft Conventions of the nature of those now submitted can be properly and competently ratified by Canada as a member of the League of Nations.\nIn this Court, the question as to where lies the power to create an international obligation dealing with matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces is concluded by our decision on the reference Re: Legislative Jurisdiction over Hours of Labour ([1925] S.C.R. 505).\nIt follows that the Draft Conventions not having received the consent and the approval of the legislatures of the provinces, nor even of the provincial governments, were not properly and competently ratified; and the Acts adopted in relation to these Draft Conventions and allegedly for the purpose of performing the obligations arising under them are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014When an Act of Parliament is challenged before this Court as unconstitutional, the article of the Constitution which is, invoked should be laid beside the statute which is challenged in order to decide whether the latter squares with the former. The only power of this Court is to announce its judgment upon the question. This Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Its office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with or in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution. The question is not what power the Federal Government ought to have, but what powers, in fact, have been given to it by the B.N.A. Act. There is in this country a dual form of government, and in every province there are two governments. Our country differs from nations where all legislative power, without restriction, is vested in a parliament, or other legislative body, subject to no restriction.\nIf any changes are required to face new situations or to cope with the increased importance of Canada as a nation, they may be secured by an amendment to the B.N.A. Act; but neither this Court nor the Privy Council should be called upon to legislate outside of its provisions.\nThe labour draft conventions in this case, binding Canada independently from the rest of the Empire, do not fall under section 132, B.N.A. Act; they were not even contemplated as feasible in 1867 when that Act was passed. Radio and aeronautics are also new matters not existing at that time and had to be dealt with by the Privy Council as outside the enumerated subjects of 91 and 92 B.N.A. Act; and these two decisions must be considered as arr\u00eats d\u2019esp\u00e8ce and confined to the subject-matters which both had necessarily interprovincial and international aspects.\nBut the payment of wages for labour, the weekly rest and the rate of wages and length of hours of work were well known subjects in 1887 and they were, by common agreement, reserved by the Imperial Parliament to the provinces as purely local and private matters of property and civil rights.\nTherefore, in the words of section 405 of the Treaty of Versailles, Canada as a federal state has only a \u201cpower to enter into convention on labour matters subject to limitations\u201d and the draft conventions should have been treated as \u201crecommendation only.\u201d Such recommendation is to be submitted to the members for \u201cconsideration with a view to effect being given to it by national legislation or otherwise.\u201d The Versailles Treaty recognizes that in certain cases, effect can be given to a labour agreement \u201cotherwise\u201d than by national legislation. In these cases, it does not appear that either the recommendations or the draft conventions were submitted to the provinces, i.e., the \u201cauthorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action\u201d; and this is fatal to the validity of the ratification of these labour conventions by the Federal authorities. As an internal matter, such changes in the (respective constitutional powers of the provinces and of the Central Government cannot be justified\u2019 by invoking some clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Respect of their property and civil rights was guaranteed by the British Crown to the inhabitants of the original provinces as far back as the Treaty of Paris in 1763; this was confirmed by the constitution of 1867 which cannot be changed in this essential part except by an Imperial statute, as plainly set forth in the Act of Westminster of 1031, section 7. Therefore the Parliament and the Government of Canada cannot appropriate those powers, exclusively reserved to the provinces, by the simple process of ratifying a labour convention passed at Geneva with representatives of foreign countries. Neither\u2019 the Governor General in Council, nor Parliament, can in any way, and specifically by an agreement with a foreign power, change the constitution of Canada or take away from the provinces their competency to deal exclusively with the enumerated subjects of section 92, B.N.A. Act. Before accepting as binding any agreement under section 405 of the Treaty of Versailles, foreign powers must take notice that this country\u2019s constitution is a federal, not a legislative union.\nPer Crocket J.\u2014The Acts passed by the Dominion Parliament embody legislation which is directly aimed at the regulation and control of contracts of employment, private as well as public, in every province of the Dominion, and thus deal in a very real and radical sense with civil rights in all the provinces of Canada alike; and the fundamental question before this Court is whether there is any authority within the B.N.A. Act for the exercise of such legislative power by the Parliament of Canada.\nNone of the draft conventions of the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations, upon the ratification of which by the Government of Canada it has been sought to justify the enactment of this legislation, fall within the terms of section 132 of the B.N.A. Act. Even if the Treaty of Versailles were a treaty between the British Empire, as an undivided unit, and those foreign states, whose plenipotentiaries signed it, and not a treaty purporting to have been entered into by the self-governing Dominions of the Empire as separate governments, it could not be said that there was any obligation for the performance of which the Parliament of Canada was empowered within the terms of section 132 to enact legislation as pertaining to an obligation imposed by that treaty upon Canada or any province thereof, as part of the British Empire.\nAs regards the residuary clause of section 91, this provision can only be invoked where the real subject matter of the legislation does not fall within the classes of subjects which are exclusively assigned to the provinces by section 92; once it appears that the real purpose and effect of a Dominion enactment is to interfere with private and civil rights in the provinces and that in that aspect it consequently falls within the sphere of legislation which has been exclusively reserved for the provinces, not only by the provisions of section 92, but by the saving clause in the introduction of section 91, such an enactment cannot be justified under the general authority conferred on the Parliament of Canada. If such legislation could be maintained on the ground that it was for the peace, order and good government of Canada, it could only be by ignoring the explicit limitation, which is placed on the so-called general authority by the residuary clause itself with the obvious intention of preventing its application in the very sense now contended for, and thus protecting the provinces in the full enjoyment of their exclusive legislative rights as permanently guaranteed to them by section 91.\nAlthough the Government of Canada must now be held to be the proper medium for the formal conclusion of international conventions, whether they affect the Dominion as a whole or any of the provinces separately, this fact cannot be relied on as altering in any way the provisions of the B.N.A. Act as regards the distribution of legislative power as between the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures or as necessarily giving to any matter, which may be made the subject of legislation in Canada, any other meaning or aspect than that which it bears in our original constitution!. Whether such a matter is one which falls under the terms of either section 91 or of section 92 or of section 132, must depend upon the real intendment of the B.N.A. Act itself, as gathered from the terms of those sections and the Act as a whole.\nThe legislation embodied in these three statutes is legislation which the Parliament of Canada has enacted to give effect to the draft conventions of the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations. These conventions are admittedly conventions, to which the Government of Canada were in no manner bound to\u00ab assent or to formally ratify. They were submitted to the Government of this country as mere draft conventions, and stood as such until 1935, when the Government of Canada chose to approve them, several years after the expiration of the period fixed by article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles for their submission \u201cto the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action.\u201d The provision of article 405 of the Peace Treaty of Versailles is clearly mandatory and not merely directory and the ratification of the conventions, upon which these three statutes purport to be founded, is null and void under the terms of that article. However, the provisions of the B.N.A. Act, not the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, should be looked at for the answers to the questions submitted on this reference concerning the constitutionality of these three statutes; and, accordingly, they are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nREFERENCES by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), of the following questions: Are The Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, The Minimum Wages Act and The Limitation of Hours of Work Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the; Parliament of Canada?\nThe Order in Council referring the questions to the Court read as follows: The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 31st October, 1935, from the Minister of Justice, referring to the following Acts contained in the statutes of Canada, 1935, namely\u2014\nThe Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, cap. 14;\nThe Minimum Wages Act, cap. 44; and\nThe Limitation of Hours of Work Act, cap. 63,\nwhich were respectively passed, as appears from the recitals set out in the preambles of the said Acts, for the purpose of enacting the necessary legislation to enable Canada to discharge certain obligations declared to have been assumed by Canada under the provisions of the Treaty of Peace made between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles, on the 28th day of June, 1919, and to which Canada, as part of the British Empire, was a signatory, and also under certain draft conventions concerning (a) the application of the weekly rest in industrial undertakings, (b) the creation of minimum wage fixing machinery, and (c) the limitation of hours of work in industrial undertakings, respectively adopted by the International Labour Conference in accordance with the relevant articles of the said Treaty.\nThe Minister observes that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to enact the said Acts or any of them either in whole or in part, and that it is expedient that such questions should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nThe Committee, accordingly, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the following questions be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act,\u2014\n1. Is The Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada? 2. Is The Minimum Wages Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what exent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n3. Is The Limitation of Hours of Work Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n*The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The validity of the legislation is attacked on various grounds which will be stated presently.\nThe draft convention respecting minimum wage fixing machinery was adopted by the General Council of the Labour Organization of the League of Nations on the 6th. June, 1928, and a copy was communicated to Canada on August 23rd, 1928.\nResolutions declaring it to be \u201cexpedient that Parliament do approve of\u201d the draft convention were passed by the House of Commons (on March 15th, 1935) and by the Senate (on April 2nd, 1935).\nThe draft convention was, under art. 7 thereof, transformed into a \u201cconvention,\u201d by the assent of two members of the Labour Organization on the 14th June, 1930. On the 12th April, 1935, the Governor General, by Order in Council, ordered on behalf \u00f3f Canada that the convention \u201cbe confirmed and approved\u201d and that \u201cformal communication\u201d f this confirmation and approval \u201cbe made to the Secretary General of the League of Nations.\u201d On 25th April, 1935, the formal instrument of ratification was deposited with the Secretary of the League of Nations. The statute in controversy was assented to on the 28th of June, 1935, in which there is the following preamble:\nWhereas the Dominion of Canada is a signatory, as part of the British Empire, to the Treaty of Peace made between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles, on the 28th day of June, 1919; and whereas the said Treaty of Peace was confirmed by the Treaty of Peace Act, 1919; and whereas by article 23 of the said Treaty the signatories thereto each agreed that they would endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and by article 427 of the said Treaty it was declared that the well-being, physical, moral and intellectual, of industrial wage-earners is of supreme importance; and whereas a Convention concerning minimum wages was adopted as a Draft Convention by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations in accordance with the relevant articles of the said Treaty, which said Convention has been ratified by Canada; and whereas it is advisable to enact the necessary legislation to enable Canada to discharge the obligations assumed under the provisions of the said Treaty and the said Convention, and to provide for minimum wages in accordance with the provisions of the said Convention, and to assist in the maintenance on equitable terms of interprovincial and international trade: Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\u2014\nThe immediate question put in precise form is this: Is the statute which, by its preamble, recites the adoption of the draft convention by the General Conference of the Labour Organization and the ratification of that convention by Canada, constitutionally effective, without the assent of the provinces, to alter the law of those provinces by bringing that law into conformity with the stipulations of the convention so ratified: the matter of these stipulations being, ex hypothesi, normally, (and saving certain specific fields of legislation with which we are not concerned) a subject matter of legislation within the ex-elusive competence of the respective provincial legislatures under section 92 of the B.N.A. Act?\nThe principal points now in controversy arise upon these contentions of the provinces:\nFirst, that the Governor General in Council has no authority to enter into any international engagement; second, that, since the subject matter of the convention falls within the subdivision of s. 92, which relates to property and civil rights within the provinces, the assent of the provincial legislatures was an essential condition of a valid ratification under art. 405 of the Labour Part of the Treaty.\nThird, that in view of the character of its subject matter, the provinces alone are competent to give the force of law to the Convention. We shall discuss in another place (in the reasons for the answers in the Reference concerning the Natural Products Marketing Act) (p. 403) the contention that the Dominion, independently of her powers in respect of international obligations, possessed authority in the circumstances of the time to enact the statute under the residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nAs a step preliminary to the examination of the arguments addressed to us in support of these contentions, some brief observations upon the legislative and executive authority of the Parliament and Government of Canada in respect of international agreements may be useful.\nAn interesting and valuable account was presented in argument of the development of Dominion status within the British Empire or the British Commonwealth of Nations. Stages in that development are marked by the Imperial War Conference of 1917, the proceedings in the negotiation, the signature and the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and of the Fisheries Treaty of 1923, by the Imperial Conferences of 1923, 1926 and 1930, and finally by the Statute of Westminster, 1931. At the moment it is sufficient to observe\u2014as to status\u2014that two fundamental characteristics of it are defined in unmistakeable words in the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926:\n* * * we refer to the group of self-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions. Their position and mutual relations may be readily defined. They are autonomous Communities within the British. Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\nGreat Britain and the Dominions (1) are united by a common allegiance to the British Crown, and (2) are \u201cautonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs\u2026and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\u201d\nThe possession of equality of status with Great Britain in respect of all aspects of external as well as domestic affairs is thus affirmed in language admitting of no dispute as to its intent or effect. This equality of status, as the report later explains, does not necessarily imply identity of function. It does, however, indisputably involve two very definite things. In the legislative sphere (subject to the disabilities imposed expressly or by necessary implication by the B.N.A. Act, and the Statute of Westminster, and to whatever restrictions may be implicit in her position as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations owing a common allegiance to the Crown) the legislative authority reposed in the Parliament and Legislatures of Canada is plenary and embraces the whole field of external as well as domestic matters; and, in the executive sphere, while the executive authority for Canada is vested in the King, it is exercised according to the advice of the appropriate Canadian Government, and under the control of the appropriate legislature.\nAs regards legislative authority, this is precisely what is evidenced by the Statute of Westminster. The statute recognizes the common allegiance to the King as the bond uniting Great Britain and the Dominions. Extraterritorial legislative authority is in apt and express terms conferred upon the Dominion Parliaments. But three declarations signalize in a striking way the fundamental dogma of equality. The first is in the preamble, and is concerned with the royal style and title and the succession to the Throne. In respect of these, the preamble declares that no alteration in the law could be made consistently with the constitutional position except with the consent of all. Then there is the declaration that no statute of the United Kingdom should have effect in any Dominion as part of its law without the consent of that Dominion. And lastly, it is declared that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to give to the Parliament of Canada power to amend the B.N.A. Act. These reservations bring into relief the sweeping character of the legislative authority which is possessed by the Parliament of Canada and Legislatures combined.\nAs respects the executive sphere, the statute does not explicitly speak except in its recognition of the common allegiance to the Crown as the bond of union. In that field, however, the declarations of the Imperial Conferences leave no doubt as to the constitutional position. First, as to the Governor General. In the report of 1926 his position is defined thus:\nWe proceeded to consider whether it was desirable formally to place on record a definition of the position held by the Governor General as His Majesty\u2019s representative in the Dominions. That position, though now generally well recognized, undoubtedly represents a development from an earlier stage when the Governor General was appointed solely on the advice of His Majesty\u2019s Ministers in London and acted also as their representative.\nIn our opinion it is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor General of a Dominion is the representative of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty\u2019s Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government.\nThis declaration of 1926 is repeated in 1930:\nThe Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1926 declared that the Governor General of a Dominion is now the\nrepresentative of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty\u2019s Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government.\nAs to the particular matter with which we are now concerned, the authority of the Government of Canada in relation to international arrangements, the Reports of the Imperial Conferences for 1923 and 1926 contain most important declarations. In substance, in so far as they are immediately pertinent, they amount to this\u2014the Conferences recommend that the practice initiated in connection with the Halibut Fisheries Treaty of 1923 with the United States shall be continued and that, pursuant to that practice, agreements between Great Britain and a foreign country, or a Dominion and a foreign country, shall take the form of treaties between heads of states (except in the case of agreements between governments), the responsible government being in each case the Government of Great Britain or the Government of the Dominion concerned upon whose advice plenipotentiaries are appointed and full powers granted.\nThe argument on behalf of some of the provinces (while conceding equality of status between the Dominions and Great Britain in respect of such matters, and the political responsibility of the Dominion Government in respect of all treaties or agreements to which the Dominion is a party) denies the authority of the Governor General, acting on the advice of the Canadian Government, to conclude a treaty or an agreement with a foreign state. The prerogative, it is said, resides in the Crown and it is most earnestly contended that the power to exercise this prerogative has never been delegated to the Governor General of Canada or to any Canadian authority.\nWith reference to the Report of the Conference of 1926, which in explicit terms recognizes treaties in the form of agreements between governments (to which His Majesty is not, in form, a party), it is said that since an Imperial Conference possesses no legislative power, its declarations do not operate to effect changes in the law, and it is emphatically affirmed that, in point of strict law, neither the Governor General nor any other Canadian authority has received from the Crown power to exercise the prerogative.\nThe argument is founded on the distinction it draws between constitutional convention and legal rule; and it is necessary to examine the contention that, in point of legal rule, as distinct from constitutional convention, the Governor General in Council had no authority to become party by ratification to the convention with which we are concerned.\nThere are various points of view from which this contention may be considered. First of all, constitutional law consists very largely of established constitutional usages recognized by the Courts as embodying a rule of law. An Imperial Conference, it is true, possesses no legislative authority. But there could hardly be more authoritative evidence as to constitutional usage than the declarations of such a Conference. The Conference of 1926 categorically recognizes treaties in the form of agreements between governments in which His Majesty does not formally appear, and in respect of which there has been no Royal intervention. It is the practice of the Dominion to conclude with foreign countries agreements in such form, and agreements even of a still more informal character\u2014merely by an exchange of notes. Conventions under the auspices of the Labour Organization of the League of Nations invariably are ratified by the Government of the Dominion concerned. As a rule, the crystallization of constitutional usage into a rule of constitutional law to which the Courts will give effect is a slow process extending over a long, period of time; but the Great War accelerated the pace of development in the region with which we are concerned, and it would seem that the usages to which I have referred, the practice, that is to say, under which Great Britain and the Dominions enter into agreements with foreign countries in the form of agreements between governments and of a still more informal character, must be recognized by the Courts as having the force of law.\nIndeed, agreements between the Government of Canada and other governments in the form of an agreement between Governments, to which His Majesty is not a party, have been recognized by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as adequate in international law to create an international obligation binding upon Canada (Radio Reference[1]. The Convention in question there was the Radio Telegraphic Convention of the 25th November, 1927, which was a convention between the Governments of Great Britain, Canada and other countries. The Convention was concluded \u201csubject to ratification.\u201d The ratification was in the following form:\nWhereas a Convention together with General Regulations relating to Radio Telegraphy was signed at Washington on the 25th November, 1927, by the representatives of His Majesty\u2019s Government in Canada and of other Governments specified therein, which Convention and General Regulations are word for word as follows:\u2014\nHis Majesty\u2019s Government in Canada having considered the aforesaid Convention together with the General Regulations, hereby confirm and ratify the same and undertake faithfully to perform and carry out the stipulations therein contained, in witness whereof this instrument of ratification is signed and sealed by the Secretary of State for External Affairs for Canada.\nErnest Lap ointe,\nFor the Secretary of State for External Affairs.\nOttawa, July 12, 1928.\nThis ratification, it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, was effective, and created a diplomatic obligation binding on Canada which the Parliament of Canada was competent to enforce by legislation. Ratification was the effective act which gave binding force to the convention. It was, as respects Canada, the act of the Government of Canada alone, and the decision mentioned appears, therefore, to negative decisively the contention that, in point of strict law, the Government of Canada is incompetent to enter into an international engagement.\nIt is, however, essential in considering the question now before us not to lose sight of the fact that the ratification with which we are concerned on this reference is one professedly effected pursuant to a treaty obligation arising under the Treaty of Versailles; and some reference to the general features of that treaty, well known though they are, is unavoidable.\nIt is a treaty of peace. It is a treaty between the British Empire and foreign countries. Prima facie, therefore, by section 132 of the British North America Act, the Parliament and Government of Canada have \u201call powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada\u2026as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under\u201d the Treaty.\nBy the terms of article 405, upon ratification of a convention notified to Canada, Canada incurs an obligation to take such action as may be necessary to \u201cmake effective\u201d the provisions of the convention. The question whether or not there has been ratification of the convention within the contemplation of the article will be considered later. The point to be emphasized here is that the obligation to \u201cmake effective\u201d the provisions of the convention is a treaty obligation and, prima facie, therefore, an obligation in respect of which the Dominion Parliament is invested with the authority bestowed by section 132. The Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, 10 Geo. V, ch. 30, is in the following terms. It is convenient to reproduce the statute in full:\nAn Act for carrying into effect the Treaties of Peace between His Majesty and certain other Powers.\n(Assented to 10th November, 1919).\nWhereas, at Versailles, on the twenty-eighth day of June, nineteen hundred and nineteen, a Treaty of Peace (including a Protocol annexed thereto), between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, a copy of which has been laid before each House of Parliament, was signed on behalf of His Majesty, acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries therein named; and whereas, a Treaty of Peace between the Allies and Associated Powers and Austria has since been signed on behalf of His Majesty, acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries therein named, and it is expedient that the Governor in Council should have power to do all such things as may be proper and expedient for giving effect to the said Treaties; Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\n1.(1) The Governor in Council may make such appointments, establish such offices, make such Orders in Council, and do such things as appear to Him to be necessary for carrying out the said Treaties, and for giving effect to any of the provisions of the said Treaties.\n(2) Any Order in Council made under this Act may provide for the imposition by summary process or otherwise, of penalties in respect of breaches of the provisions thereof, and shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after it is made, and shall have effect as if enacted in this Act, but may be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order in Council.\n(3) Any expense incurred in carrying out the said Treaties shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament.\n2. This Act may be cited as The Treaties of Peace Act, 1919.\nThe Governor in Council is, by this statute, the proper authority for authorizing ratification under article 405. The Parliament of Canada, it will be observed, consists of His Majesty the King, the Senate and the House of Commons (Section 17 B.N.A. Act); and this statute, enacted pursuant to the authority of section 132, in itself empowers the Governor General in Council to exercise any prerogative concerning foreign relations in order to carry out the stipulations of the Treaty. The Governor General acts as the delegate of His Majesty as well as the agent of Parliament. A.G. v. Cain[2]. Moreover, section 132 itself invests the Government of Canada, as well as the Parliament of Canada., with all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada under a treaty within the scope of that section; and the Governor General, by his Commission, is authorized and commanded to\nexecute * * * all things that shall belong to his said office and to the trust We have reposed in him, according to * * * such laws as are or shall hereafter be in force in Our said Dominion. (6-7 Edw. VII, p. iv).\nIn virtue of section 132 of the B.N.A. Act and of the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, the authority of the Governor in Council to authorize ratification, therefore, would seem prima facie to be indisputable.\nAs against this conclusion, two main objections are urged. First, it is said that the legislative authority created by section 132 has no application to matters falling exclusively within the legislative authority of the provinces under the terms of s. 92. Second, it is said that the section is limited in its operation to matters which are properly the subjects of international arrangement, and that such matters as the regulation of the rates of wages, the hours of labour and days of rest are matters of purely domestic concern which do not fall within that category.\nTo deal first with the second of these objections. First of all, no authority seems to indicate that such matters are excluded from the scope of the prerogative in relation to treaties. Second, the Treaty of Versailles contains, as an integral part of it, the Covenant of the League of Nations. Art. 23 of the Covenant provides inter alia:\nSubject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the Members of the League:\n(a) will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the necessary international organizations;\n(b) undertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control;\n(c) will entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs;\n* * *\nThe Treaty also includes Part 13 which provides for a permanent Labour Organization and section 1 of that Part is in these terms:\nWhereas the League of Nations has for its object the establishment of universal peace, and such a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice;\nAnd whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those conditions is urgently required: as, for example, by the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures; Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries;\nThe High Contracting Parties, moved by sentiments of justice and humanity, as well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world, agree to the following: * * *\nThe signatories to the Treaty included almost all the organized states of the world; and the Treaty would appear, especially in view of the parts of it just quoted, to involve a declaration by all these states that matters such as those which are the subject of the convention now in question, are proper subjects for international engagements. Since the Covenant was entered into this view has been acted upon time and again by the nations of the world and it would appear to be scarcely tenable that a treaty dealing with such matters is excluded for that reason alone from the operation of section 132.\nTurning to the contention that matters ordinarily falling, as subjects of legislation, within section 92 of the B.N.A. Act are excluded from the ambit of Dominion authority under section 132, it may be said at once that such a view would run counter to well established practice as well as to judicial authority. The Dominion Parliament has, in fact, exercised the powers vested in it for performing obligations arising under such treaties by legislating in relation to matters which otherwise would have fallen within the domain of property and civil rights within the several provinces, and of controlling the management and disposal of the public lands and other property of the Provincial Governments. A signal instance is the statute of 1911 which gave statutory effect to the agreements of the International Waterways Treaty of January 11, 1909 (1911 1-2 Geo. V, ch. 28). By s. 2 of that statute,\nthe laws of Canada and of the several provinces thereof are hereby amended and altered so as to permit, authorize and sanction the performance of the obligations undertaken by His Majesty in and under the said treaty; and so as to sanction, confer and impose the various rights, duties and disabilities intended by the said treaty to be conferred or imposed or to exist within Canada.\nIt is not necessary to particularize the terms of the Treaty, but, obviously, the treaty deals with matters that, but for s. 132, would indisputably have come, at the date of the statute (1911) within the exclusive spheres of the provincial legislatures. Then there is the Japanese Treaty Act (Stats, of Can. 1913, 3-4 Geo. V, ch. 27) which gave statutory effect to the treaty of the 3rd April, 1911, with Japan. By the second section, it is declared that the treaty shall have the force of law in Canada. The first four paragraphs of the first article of the Treaty are these:\nThe subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties shall have full liberty to enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other and, conforming themselves to the laws of the country\u2014\n1. Shall, in all that relates to travel and residence, be placed in all respects on the same footing as native subjects.\n2. They shall have the right, equally with native subjects, to carry on their commerce and manufacture, and to trade in all kinds of merchandise of lawful commerce, either in person or by agents singly or in partnerships with foreigners or native subjects.\n3. They shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions, and educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\n4. They shall be permitted to own or hire and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises which may be necessary for them, and to lease land for residential, commercial, industrial and other lawful purposes, in the same manner as native subjects.\nIn 1921, by ch. 49 of the statutes of that year, the legislature of British Columbia passed a statute giving legislative force to certain Orders in Council intended to put into effect a resolution of the legislature of 1902 by which it was resolved\nthat in all contracts, leases and concessions of whatsoever kind entered into, issued, or made by the government, or on behalf of the government, provision be made that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nThis statute of 1921 was challenged in respect of the competence of the legislature to enact it, and it came before the Judicial Committee in two cases,\u2014Brooks-Bidlake v. A.G. for B.C.[3] and A.G. for B.C. v. A.G. for Canada[4]. By the decision in the first of these cases, it was held that, as respects Chinese, the statute was valid as an exercise of the functions of the provincial legislature under sec. 92(5) and sec. 109 of the B.N.A. Act in regulating the management of the property of the province, and in determining whether a grantee or licensee of that property should or should not employ persons of certain races; and that its validity was not affected by the circumstance that exclusive legislative authority respecting naturalization and aliens is vested in the Parliament of Canada by head no. 25 of section 91.\nThe legislation being valid as regards Chinese, as an exercise of the legislative authority of the province under sections 92 and 109, it was held in the second of the above mentioned decisions to be invalid as regards Japanese, that is to say, the subjects of the Emperor of Japan, because it conflicted with the Japanese Treaty Act. In the absence of the Japanese Treaty and the statute giving it the force of law throughout Canada, the legislation would have been operative in respect of Japanese as well as Chinese, but the powers of the Dominion under section 132, were held to be sufficient to enable the Dominion to lay down a rule, in conformity with its obligations under the Japanese Treaty, which the provincial legislature thereby became incompetent to infringe or disregard by the exercise of powers which otherwise it would undoubtedly have possessed under the sections mentioned of the Confederation statute.\nThe scope and effect of section 132 came again before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for consideration in two cases in the year 1932: first, the Aeronautics case[5], and, second, the Radio case[6]. Each of these cases arose out of a reference to this Court, by the Governor General in Council.\nIn the first case, the first question submitted was as follows:\nHave the Parliament and Government of Canada exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any Province thereof, under the Convention entitled \u201cConvention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation?\u201d\nThat question was unanimously answered in this Court in the negative. The Judicial Committee answered it in the affirmative; and the parts of their Lordships\u2019 judgment which specially relate to that interrogatory are in these words:\nThere may also be cases where the Dominion is entitled to speak for the whole, and this not because of any judicial interpretation of ss. 91 and 92, but by reason of the plain terms of s. 132, where Canada as a whole, having undertaken an obligation, is given the power necessary and proper for performing that obligation.\n* * * In their Lordship\u2019s view, transport as a subject is dealt with in certain branches both of s. 91 and of s. 92, but neither of those sections deals specially with that branch of transport which is concerned with aeronautics.\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that it is proper to take a broader view of the matter rather than to rely on forced analogies or piecemeal analysis. They consider the governing section to be s. 132, which gives to the Parliament and Government of Canada all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries. As far as s. 132 is concerned, their Lordships are not aware of any decided case which is of assistance on the present occasion. It will be observed, however, from the very definite words of the section, that it is the Parliament and Government of Canada who are to have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or any Province thereof. It would therefore appear to follow that any Convention of the character under discussion necessitates Dominion legislation in order that it may be carried out. It is only necessary to look at the Convention itself to see what wide powers are necessary for performing the obligations arising thereunder.\n* * *\nIt is therefore obvious that the Dominion Parliament, in order duly and fully to \u201cperform the obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof\u201d under the Convention, must make provision for a great variety of subjects. Indeed, the terms of the Convention include almost every conceivable matter relating to aerial navigation, and we think that the Dominion Parliament not only has the right, but also the obligation, to provide by statute and by regulation that the terms of the Convention shall be duly carried out. With regard to some of them, no doubt, it would appear to be clear that the Dominion has power to legislate, for example, under s. 91, item 2, for the regulation of trade and commerce, and under item 5 for the postal services, but it is not necessary for the Dominion to piece together its powers under s. 91 in an endeavour to render them co-extensive with its duty under the Convention when s. 132 confers upon it full power to do all that is legislatively necessary for the purpose[7].\nIn the second of these cases, the Radio case[8], Lord Dunedin, speaking for the Board, observed, with reference to the Aeronautics case[9].\nFor this must at once be admitted, the leading consideration in the judgment of the Board was that the subject fell within the provisions of s. 132 of the British North America Act. * * *\nThe tenor of these observations is hardly compatible with the notion that the authority to legislate under s. 132 does not apply to matters which, but for that section, would have fallen within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces under other enactments of the B.N.A. Act. The power to legislate for the performance of obligations under treaties within that section is reposed exclusively in the Dominion Parliament, their Lordships declare, and, as their Lordships imply, the language is general and the power in no way depends upon the condition that the matters with which the obligation is concerned shall be matters in respect of which Parliament is invested with jurisdiction under section 91 or any other section of the B.N.A. Act. This view of these observations is confirmed by a perusal of the judgment of Lord Dunedin, delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee in the Radio case[10] the second of the cases above mentioned. Beginning at p. 311[11], he says:\u2014\nFor this must at once be admitted; the leading consideration in the judgment of the Board was that the subject fell within the provisions of s. 132 of the British North America Act, 1867, which is as follows:\nThe Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof as part of the British Empire towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nAnd it is said with truth that, while as regards aviation there was a treaty, the convention here is not a treaty between the Empire as such and foreign countries, for Great Britain does not sign as representing the Colonies and Dominions. She only confirms the assent which had been signified by the Colonies and Dominions who were separately represented at the meetings which drafted the convention. But while this is so, the aviation case in their Lordships\u2019 judgment cannot be put on one side.\nCounsel for the Province felt this and sought to avoid any general deduction by admitting that many of the things provided by the convention and the regulations thereof fell within various special heads of s. 91. For example, provisions as to beacon signals he would refer to head. 10 of s. 91\u2014navigation and shipping. It is unnecessary to multiply instances, because the real point to be considered is this manner of dealing with the subject. In other words the argument of the Province comes to this: Go through all the stipulations of the convention and each one you can pick out which fairly falls within one of the enumerated heads of s. 91, that can be held to be appropriate for Dominion legislation; but the residue belongs to the Province under the head either of head 13 of s. 92\u2014property and civil rights, or head 16\u2014matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nTheir Lordships cannot agree that the matter should be so dealt with. Canada as a Dominion is one of the signatories to the convention. In a question with foreign powers the persons who might infringe some of the stipulations in the convention would not be the Dominion of Canada as a whole but would be individual persons residing in Canada. These persons must so to speak be kept in order by legislation and the only legislation that can deal with them all at once is Dominion legislation. This idea of Canada as a Dominion being bound by a convention equivalent to a treaty with foreign powers was quite unthought of in 1867. It is the outcome of the gradual development of the position of Canada vis-\u00e0-vis to the mother country Great Britain, which is found in these later\ndays expressed in the Statute of Westminster. It is not, therefore, to be expected that such a matter should be dealt with in explicit words in either s. 91 or 92. The only class of treaty which would bind Canada was thought of as a treaty by Great Britain, and that was provided for by s. 132. Being, therefore, not mentioned explicitly in either s. 91 or s. 92, such legislation falls within the general words at the opening of s. 91 which assign to the Government of the Dominion the power to make laws \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces.\u201d In fine, though agreeing that the Convention was not such a treaty as is defined in s. 132, their Lordships think that it comes to the same thing.\n* * *\nThe result is in their Lordships\u2019 opinion clear. It is Canada as a whole which is amenable to the other powers for the proper carrying out of the convention; and to prevent individuals in Canada infringing the stipulations of the convention it is necessary that the Dominion should pass legislation which should apply to all the dwellers in Canada.\nHis Lordship proceeds to observe that the view expounded in this passage \u201cis destructive of the view urged by the province as to how the observance of the international convention should be secured.\u201d\nIt seems hardly open to dispute that their Lordships intended to lay down that international obligations, which are strictly treaty obligations within the scope of s. 132, as well as obligations under conventions between governments not falling within s. 132, are matters which, as subjects of legislation, cannot fall within s. 92 and, therefore, must fall within s. 91; and since they do not fall within any of the enumerated subjects of section 91, they are within the ambit of the Dominion power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. That seems to be the effect of what is said, because, at pp. 311 and 312, their Lordships dealt with the contention, advanced on behalf of the provinces, that legislative authority to deal with and give effect to the convention is vested, as regards matters falling within the enumerated heads of s. 91, in the Dominion Parliament; but that, as regards matters which would normally fall within s. 92, such authority is vested in the provincial legislatures. The contention is rejected, and rejected for the reasons given in the passage quoted, viz., that such matters, as the subjects of an international convention, are matters which concern the Dominion as a whole and, therefore, exclusively within the competence of the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is, at this point, important to emphasize these two things: First, that by the combined effect of the judgments in the Aeronautics case[12] and the Radio case[13], the, jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament in relation to international obligations is exclusive; and, moreover, as such matters are embraced within the authority of Parliament in relation to peace, order and good government, its power is plenary.\nIt was at one time supposed that s. 132 was the sole source of authority for Parliament in respect of the enforcement of international obligations, as regards matters which, otherwise, would fall within s. 92, and, at the same time, would not fall within any of the enumerated heads of section 91: that, for the purpose of ascertaining the ambit of that authority, one must look to the scope of s. 132 (and the conditions under which that section operates): and that from the language employed it was a legitimate inference that the jurisdiction did not arise until there was a treaty obligation in existence within the contemplation of the section. Four of the judges of this Court who took part in the judgment in the Aeronautics case (3) expressed that view.\nMoreover, it was supposed that, as regards matters normally falling within s. 92, the provinces might legislate for the purpose of giving effect to an international obligation. In the Aeronautics case12, the members of this Court were unanimously of the opinion that, as regards such matters, the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada was not exclusive, even though paramount.\nIt is now plain (as a result of these two decisions of 1932) that the provinces have no jurisdiction to legislate for the performance of such obligations, whether they be obligations within s. 132 or whether they be outside that section and within the scope of the general power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. Such obligations, we repeat, it is now settled, are not matters within the subjects of s. 92 or the enumerated subjects of s. 91.\nIt has been contended in respect of Dominion jurisdiction in relation to international matters, under section 132, as well as under the residuary clause (as pointed out in the judgment of Duff J. on the Reference relating to the employment of aliens (Japanese Treaty, 63 S.C.R. 330)) that there are certain fundamental terms of the arrangement upon which the B.N.A. Act was framed which it is difficult to suppose Parliament could in any case disregard; and that it is a necessary inference to be drawn from the B.N.A. Act as a whole as regards such terms that the Dominion cannot, without, at all events, the assistance of the Provinces, legislate in contravention of them, even in the exercise of its authority over international relations. It is not necessary to deal with this contention; it is sufficient to say that the statutes under discussion do not deal with matters excluded from Dominion jurisdiction by any such principle.\nWe now turn to a consideration of article 405 and, before discussing the text of that article, it may be desirable to recall what has been said with regard to the scope of legislative authority vested in the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces combined. Subject to the reservations mentioned, the ambit of that legislative authority would appear to embrace any action of the Government of Canada in entering into international arrangements either directly, by way of agreements between governments or otherwise without the intervention of His Majesty, or, in the case of treaties between heads of states, by plenipotentiaries appointed by His Majesty on the advice of the Canadian Government; and, generally speaking, the conduct of external affairs by that Government. As regards all such international arrangements, it is a necessary consequence of the respective positions of the Dominion executive and the provincial executives that this authority resides in the Parliament of Canada. The Lieutenant-Governors represent the Crown for certain purposes. But, in no respect does the Lieutenant-Governor of a province represent the Crown in respect of relations with foreign governments. The Canadian executive, again, constitutionally acts under responsibility to the Parliament of Canada and it is that Parliament alone which can constitutionally control its conduct of external affairs.\nAs the subject of agreements with foreign countries is not one of the subjects embraced within section 92, or within any of the enumerated heads of section 91, it follows that the authority must rest upon the residuary clause from which Parliament derives its power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada; and it follows from what has already been said that this power is plenary. It is for the Parliament of Canada to determine the conditions upon which such agreements shall be entered into as well as the manner in which they shall be performed and this may be done by antecedent legislation or by legislation taking effect ex post facto. These propositions are, indeed, corollaries of the proposition that the power is plenary.\nAs regards League of Nations matters, the following passage from the last edition of Anson\u2019s Law and Customs of the Constitution seems to state the position accurately:\n(1) In all League of Nations matters each of the Dominions (except Newfoundland) is quite independent of the United Kingdom. Its representatives at the League Assembly are not accredited by the King on the advice of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but by the Governor General on the advice of his ministers, and they act independently of the British Empire or other Dominion delegates; consultation is, of course, possible but is by no means necessary. Moreover, the Dominions are eligible for seats on the Council, despite the permanent representation thereon of the British Empire in which the Dominions are included. Canada was elected to membership in 1927, then the Irish Free State in 1930, and the Commonwealth in 1933.\n(2) The Dominions are in like manner autonomous in relation to the Labour Organization of the League. Further, conventions arrived at under its auspices are ratified by Order of the Governor General in Council, not by the King, on the advice of the Secretary of State. (pp. 87, 88.)\nAs regards all these matters, it has never been doubted that it is the executive of Canada which represents Canada or that the executive is entirely under the control of Parliament.\nThe draft convention now in question was, as we have seen, brought before the House of Commons and the Senate, received the assent of both Houses in the form of resolutions, which resolutions approved the ratification of it, and the legislation now in question was passed for the purpose of giving legislative effect to the stipulations, the operative clauses of the statute being preceded by a preamble in which it was recited that the draft convention has been ratified by Canada. The propriety of this procedure is questioned on the ground that, under the special provisions of art. 405, and especially those of paragraphs 5 and 7 of the article, the draft conventions should have been submitted to the provincial legislatures.\nThere can, of course, in view of what has been said, be no dispute that the procedure followed, if we put aside the provisions of art. 405, was the usual and the proper procedure for entering into agreements with foreign governments. The Governor General in Council is exclusively invested with the executive authority to assent to an agreement, in the form of an agreement between Governments, with the Government of a foreign state. The Parliament of Canada is the legislative body that is exclusively invested with authority to legislate in respect of the creation of obligations through the instrumentality of such agreements. It is the legislative body exclusively invested with power to legislate for giving effect to such obligations. The course of the proceedings, prior to ratification, in which the convention was approved by resolutions of the Senate and the House of Commons respectively, was in accord with the settled general practice of the Canadian Parliament in the ratification of such agreements; and the statute which, in its preamble, declares that the convention has been ratified by Canada, in itself, would constitute sanction by legislative act of that ratification. Executive and legislative authority combined, each playing its appropriate part, according to the usual procedure, in the creation of the obligation and in the enactment of legislation to give effect to it.\nOn behalf of the provinces it is said that, granting all this, these proceedings are nevertheless affected with invalidity because they do not conform to the procedure prescribed in article 405 which requires the draft convention, antecedently to ratification, to be brought before\nthe authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for enactment of legislation or other action;\nand, therefore, it is argued, requires that, in the application of the article to Canada, the competent authorities to which the draft convention must be submitted include the provincial legislatures.\nParagraphs 5 and 7 of article 405 are in these words:\nEach of the Members undertakes that it will, within the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference, or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within the period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment and in no case later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference, bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.\n* * *\nIn the case of a draft convention the Member will, if it obtains the consent of the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, communicate the formal ratification of the convention to the Secretary-General and will take such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of such convention.\nIn considering the contention of the provinces that the competent authorities within the intendment of these paragraphs include the provincial legislatures, it is necessary that the paragraphs be read together. The \u201cCompetence\u201d postulated is to enact legislation or to take other \u201caction\u201d contemplated by the article.\nThe seventh paragraph imposes upon members two conditional obligations; an obligation, upon the consent of the competent authority or authorities, to ratify; and an obligation, upon the like consent after ratification, \u201cto make effective the provisions of (the) convention\u201d within their territorial jurisdiction. Both these obligations are treaty obligations and the \u201caction.\u201d legislative or other, by the competent \u201cauthority or authorities\u201d which is contemplated by paragraph 5 would seem clearly to include the second of these obligations, if not both of them.\nAs concerns the second obligation, the answer to the question, What is the constitutional agency responsible for discharging it? would appear to be dictated by section 132 which is once again quoted verbatim:\n132. The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards Foreign Countries arising under Treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nThe power to perform the obligations of the Treaty to make the provisions of the convention effective, in so far as it requires legislative action, is by this section vested primarily in the Parliament of Canada. In so far as it requires executive action, it is vested in the Government of Canada. The judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Aeronautics case[14] and the Radio case[15] constrain us to hold that jurisdiction to legislate for the purpose of performing the obligation\u2014for bringing the law of the Canadian provinces into harmony with the provisions of the convention, for example\u2014resides exclusively in the Parliament of Canada; and, by parity of reasoning, if not, indeed, as an obvious logical consequence of that proposition, jurisdiction resides, in so far as executive action is required, exclusively in the Government of Canada.\nThere can be no possible doubt, therefore, that the Parliament of Canada is at least one of the authorities before which the draft convention must be brought in the performance of the duty imposed upon Canada by paragraph 5. The question whether, by force of the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, the Governor General in Council is empowered to act as the agent of Parliament in this respect was not discussed and is of no importance, since the assent of both Houses of Parliament and of the Governor General in Council was admittedly given.\nThe question remains: Are the provincial legislatures, also comprehended under the phrase \u201cauthority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action?\u201d\nAt one time we thought that, since by s. 92 the jurisdiction, speaking generally, to legislate in relation to the subjects dealt with by the draft convention would, in the absence of any international agreement and of legislation by the Parliament of Canada under s. 132, fall within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, the provincial legislatures might fairly be said to be included within this description. But we have been forced to the conclusion above expressed that the \u201clegislation or other action\u201d contemplated by paragraph 5 is \u201caction\u201d concerning making \u201ceffective the provisions of the convention,\u201d and, perhaps, also, action concerning ratification. That seems to me to be the plain reading of this article; and where you have authorities (the Parliament and Government of Canada) which are exclusively invested with the power to take legislative and executive measures for the performance of international obligations, we can see no escape from the conclusion that such are the authorities designated by these paragraphs.\nWe were at one time much influenced by the consideration of the importance of obtaining the assent of the provincial legislatures, which would naturally be more conversant with the conditions prevailing in their respective provinces and more capable of estimating the difficulties of giving effect to a given convention therein than the Parliament of Canada could be expected to be; but such considerations, we have been forced to conclude, cannot justify a refusal to give effect to what seems to be the true construction of this article.\nUpon the true construction, the provincial legislatures, it seems to me, after a prolonged examination of the question in all its bearings, are not authorities competent to enact legislation or to take executive action for the purposes contemplated by paragraph 5; that is to say, either for making \u201ceffective the provisions of the convention,\u201d or for ratification.\nIt will appear, however, from the observations which immediately follow that it is strictly not necessary to decide the question we have just dealt with. My view as to the validity of the legislation can be rested upon another ground.\nMr. Rowell contends as follows:\nGeneral authority to bind Canada by adherence to an international convention containing the substance of the stipulations of that in question is vested in the Government of Canada, and a general authority to legislate for giving effect to any obligation arising from such adherence is vested in the Parliament of Canada: the Parliament of Canada, moreover, is the legislative body which has power to legislate for Canada in relation to the creation, as well as the enforcement, of international obligations: ratification of a convention, therefore, it is argued, which has been authorized by the Government of Canada with the assent of the Houses \u00f6f Parliament, and in respect of which legislation has been enacted recognizing the ratification and providing for the enforcement of the stipulations of the convention, is one which is diplomatically binding on Canada.\nThe duty of the member, Canada, under art. 405, to submit the draft convention to the competent authorities is a duty committed to the Government of Canada. It is committed to the Government of Canada by the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, a statute indisputably within the jurisdiction of the Dominion under s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. By that statute, the Governor General in Council, as we have seen, is entrusted with the performance of that duty. It is the same authority (the Governor General in Council) who is also entrusted, by force of the same statute, with the duty of ratifying the draft convention upon the assent of the competent authorities. Ratification by the Governor General in Council would seem to imply a representation that the conditions of the authority to ratify have been fulfilled.\nBy the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, Parliament, that is to say, the King in Parliament, imposed upon the Governor General in Council the responsibility of passing such Orders in Council and doing such acts as to him might appear necessary for carrying out and giving effect to the provisions of the Treaty. Moreover, the statute now under consideration expressly by its preamble declares that the convention has been ratified by Canada. The Governor in Council, in authorizing the ratification, spoke as the agent of Parliament as well as the representative of His Majesty the King. The ratification was accepted by Parliament as a ratification binding upon His Majesty for Canada. It has all the force, therefore, of a ratification authorized by the King in Parliament. Considering the sweeping character of the legislative authority reposed in Parliament and the legislatures combined, and the scope of the powers which consequently devolve upon Parliament in respect of matters outside the provincial sphere (which matters include the creation as well as the enforcement of international obligations), it would seem that Canada could not be more solemnly committed as to the validity of the ratification in question as a ratification under art. 405. Some reference is necessary to the answers given to the interrogatories addressed to this Court in 1925 on a reference in relation to one of the conventions now under consideration\u2014the convention relating to Hours of Labour[16]. We do not enter upon a systematic examination of that decision. The view expressed in the preceding pages as to the effect of the judgments of the Judicial Committee[17] [18] and its bearing upon the construction of article 405 require us to consider afresh the question of the \u201ccompetence\u201d of the provincial legislatures in so far as it is relevant within the meaning of art. 405 in the light of those decisions. We have already expressed the view that, in effect, they negative the \u201ccompetence\u201d of the provincial legislatures in the pertinent sense. The view expressed in the last preceding paragraph is, obviously, of course, not affected by what was decided in 1925.\nThe result is that \u201cThe Minimum Wages Act\u201d is valid.\nIn substance, the foregoing reasoning govern the decision as to the answers to the interrogatories touching the validity of the statutes relating to Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings and the Limitation of Hours of Work, which are, therefore, also valid.\nTo summarize:\u2014\nFrom two main considerations, the conclusion follows that legislative authority in respect of international agreements is, as regards Canada, vested exclusively in the Parliament of Canada.\nFirst, by virtue of section 132 of the British North America Act, jurisdiction, legislative and executive, for the purpose of giving effect to any treaty obligation imposed upon Canada, or any one of the provinces of Canada, by force of a treaty between the British Empire and a foreign country, is committed to the Parliament and Government of Canada. This jurisdiction of the Dominion, the Privy Council held, in the Aeronautics case17 and in the Radio case18 is exclusive; and consequently, under the British North America Act, the provinces have no power and never had power to legislate for the purpose of giving effect to an international agreement: that, as a subject of legislation, is excluded from the jurisdiction envisaged by section 92.\nSecond, as a result of the constitutional development of the last thirty years (and more particularly of the last twenty years) Canada has acquired the status of an international unit, that is to say, she has been recognized by His Majesty the King, by the other nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and by the nations of the world, as possessing a status enabling her to enter into, on her own behalf, international arrangements, and to incur obligations under such arrangements. These arrangements may take various forms. They may take the form of treaties, in the strict sense, between heads of states, to which His Majesty the King is formally a party. They may take, inter alia, the form of agreements between governments, in which His Majesty does not formally appear, Canada being represented by the Governor General in Council or by a delegate or delegates authorized directly by him. Whatever the form of the agreement, it is now settled that, as regards Canada, it is the Canadian Government acting on its own responsibility to the Parliament of Canada which deals with the matter. If the international contract is in the form of a treaty between heads of states, His Majesty acts, as regards Canada, on the advice of his Canadian Government.\nNecessarily, in virtue of the fundamental principles of our constitution, the Canadian Government in exercising these functions is under the control of Parliament. Parliament has full power by legislation to determine the conditions under which international agreements may be entered into and to provide for giving effect to them. That this authority is exclusive would seem to follow inevitably from the circumstances that the Lieutenant-Governors of the provinces do not in any manner represent His Majesty in external affairs, and that the provincial governments are not concerned with such affairs: the effect of the two decisions reported in 1932 Appeal Cases is that in all these matters the authority of Parliament is not merely paramount, but exclusive. The first of the two cardinal questions raised by the contentions of the provinces has two branches, and may be stated thus: Has Parliament authority to legislate for carrying out a treaty or convention or agreement with a foreign country containing stipulations to which effect can only be given by domestic legislation changing the law of the provinces (a) in matters committed by the British North America Act (in the absence of any such international agreement) to the legislatures of the provinces exclusively, and (6) in relation to such matters where they are ex facie of domestic concern only and not of international concern, such, for example (as the provinces argue), as the matters dealt with by the conventions to which effect is given by the statutes now before us: the regulation of wages and of hours of labour.\nThe claim of Parliament to authority to execute legislative changes in the law of the provinces in such matters naturally arouses concern and misgiving among the authorities charged with responsibility touching the status and rights of the provinces.\nThe view that the exclusive authority of Parliament extends to international treaties and agreements relating to such subjects rests on the grounds now outlined.\n(1) As touching the view advanced that the subject matters of the stipulations in the international agreements in question are of exclusively domestic and not at all of international concern: the language of section 132 is unqualified and that section would appear prima facie to extend to any treaty with a foreign country in relation to any subject matter which in contemplation of the rules of constitutional law respecting the royal prerogative concerning treaties would be a legitimate subject matter for a treaty; and there would appear to be no authority for the proposition that treaties in relation to subjects, such as the subject matter of the statutes in question are not within the scope of that prerogative. The question whether the language of section 132 is, by necessary implication, subject to some restriction in order to preserve unimpaired radical guarantees evidenced by the B.N.A. Act as a whole is mentioned in the next succeeding paragraph. Legislative authority to give effect to treaties within section 132 remained, of course, after the B.N.A. Act, down to the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in the Imperial Parliament, although by section 132, it also became and is vested in the Parliament of Canada; but, since the Statute of Westminster, no Act of the Imperial Parliament can have effect in Canada without the consent of Canada. The practice of modern times and, in particular, the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations embodied in the Treaty of Versailles would appear to demonstrate that by common consent of the nations of the world, such matters are regarded as of high international as well as of domestic concern and proper subjects for treaty stipulation.\n(2) As touching the view that the legislative authority committed to the Parliament and Government of Canada by section 132 (and by the introductory clause of section 91 in relation to international matters) does not extend to matters which would fall exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, in the absence of any international obligation respecting them, it is to be observed: First, section 132 relates inter alia to obligations imposed upon any province of Canada by any treaty between the British Empire and a foreign country, Section 132 obviously contemplates the possibility of such an obligation arising as a diplomatic obligation under such a treaty, even although legislation might be necessary in order to attach to it the force of law. In such case, the Parliament and Government of Canada appear to be endowed with the necessary legislative and executive powers. This provision with regard to the obligations of the provinces taken together with the generality of the language employed in Section 132 would seem to point rather definitely to the conclusion that the view under consideration is not tenable;\nSecondly, the established practice of the Parliament of Canada and the decisions of the Courts in relation to that practice do not accord with this view. Statutes giving effect to the International Waterways Treaty (1911) with the United States, and the Treaty with Japan (1913) are instances in which treaties dealing with matters of civil right within the provinces and the management of the public property of the provinces were given the force of law by Dominion statutes. The legislation concerning the Japanese Treaty was held to be valid and to nullify a statute of the Province inconsistent with it by the Judicial: Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada[19].\nThe jurisdiction of Parliament to enforce international obligations under agreements which are not strictly \u201ctreaties\u201d within section 132 is co-ordinate with the jurisdiction under this last named section.\nIt is contended by the Provinces that the Dominion cannot by reason merely of the existence of an international agreement (within section 132 or within the residuary clause) possess legislative authority enabling the Parliament of Canada to legislate in derogation of certain fundamental terms which, it is said, were the basis of the Union of 1867, and are expressly or impliedly embodied in the B.N.A. Act. For the purposes of the present reference, it is unnecessary to make any observation upon this contention further than what has already been said, viz., that the exclusive authority of the Dominion to give the force of law to an international agreement is not affected by the circumstances alone that, in the absence of such an agreement, the exclusive legislative authority of the provinces would extend to the subject matter of it.\nThe second of the cardinal questions requiring determination concerns the construction and effect of article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles.\nThe draft conventions now in question were brought before the House of Commons and the Senate, received the assent of both Houses in the form of resolutions, which resolutions approved the ratification of them, and the statutes in question were passed for the purpose of giving legislative effect to their stipulations, the operative clauses of the statute being in each case preceded by a preamble in which it is recited that the draft conventions have been ratified by Canada. The procedure followed, if we put aside the provisions of article 405, was the usual and proper procedure for engaging in and giving effect to agreements with foreign governments. The propriety of this procedure is questioned on the ground that under the special provisions of article 405, and especially those of paragraphs 5 and 7 of the article, it was an essential condition of the jurisdiction of Parliament to legislate for the enforcement of the conventions that the conventions should have been submitted to, and should have received the assent of, the provincial legislatures before the enactment of such legislation by Parliament. Paragraphs 5 and 7 are as follows:\nEach of the Members undertakes that it will, within the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within the period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment and in no case later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference, bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.\n* * *\nIn the case of a draft convention, the Member will, if it obtains the consent of the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, communicate the formal ratification of the convention to the Secretary-General and will take such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of such convention.\nThese paragraphs must be read together and, reading them together, it would appear that the \u201ccompetence\u201d postulated is the \u201ccompetence\u201d to enact legislation or to take other \u201caction\u201d contemplated by the article.\nThe obligations upon consent of the competent authority or authorities to ratify and, upon like consent after ratification, \u201cto make effective the provisions of the convention\u201d are both treaty obligations; and the authority or authorities competent to take legislative action where legislative action may be necessary to make the provisions of the convention effective would appear plainly to be included within the authority or authorities before whom it is provided that the draft conventions shall be brought.\nIt follows from what has been said that this treaty obligation is an obligation within section 132 and, consequently, that the authority to make the convention effective exclusively rests in the Parliament and Government of Canada and, therefore, that the Parliament of Canada is, at least, one of the authorities before which the convention must be brought under the terms of article 405. The question whether the provincial legislatures are also competent authorities within the contemplation of paragraph 5 would appear to be necessarily determined by the consideration that we are constrained by the decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[20], already referred to, to hold that the authority of Parliament in this matter is exclusive and that the provincial legislatures are not, competent to legislate for giving effect to the provisions of any international convention. * * * Strictly, however, important as this question of the \u201ccompetence\u201d of\u2019 the provincial legislatures in the sense of article 405 is, it is unnecessary to decide it for the purposes of this reference; as will appear from what immediately follows.\nThe Governor General in Council is designated by the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, enacted under the authority of section 132, to take all such measures as may seem to him to be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Treaties of Peace and for giving effect to the terms of such treaties. He it was, therefore, upon whom devolved the duty of performing the obligation of Canada under art. 405 to bring the draft conventions before the authority or authorities possessing \u201ccompetence\u201d under the Constitution of Canada. He it was also on whom devolved the duty to communicate to the League of Nations the ratification by Canada upon the assent of the competent authority or authorities. Moreover, the Parliament of Canada, as we have seen, possessing exclusive jurisdiction in relation to international agreements, the creation as well as the enforcement of them, declared, by the statutes now under examination, that the conventions in question were ratified by Canada. The executive authority, therefore, charged with the duty of acting for Canada in performing the treaty obligations of submitting the conventions to the proper constitutional authorities and of communicating ratification to the League of Nations upon the assent of those authorities, and His Majesty the King in Parliament have, in effect, combined in declaring that the ratification was assented to by the proper constitutional authorities of Canada in conformity with the stipulations of article 405.\nThat would appear to be sufficient to constitute a diplomatic obligation binding upon Canada to observe the provisions of the conventions.\nThe answer to the three interrogatories addressed to this Court under this Order of Reference is, therefore, the statutes being intra vires in each case in the negative Rinfret, J.\u2014For the purpose of giving answers to the questions referred to the Court by His Excellency the Governor General in Council concerning The Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, The Minimum Wages Act and The Limitation of Hours Act, it is well to bear in mind that, apart from any consideration resulting from their aspect as laws intended to carry out the obligations of Canada under Draft Conventions agreed upon at general conferences of the International Labour Office of the League of Nations, the subject-matter of these legislations is undoubtedly one in relation to which, under the Constitution of our Country, the legislature in each province may exclusively make laws.\nIt follows that, in order to support the validity of the Acts, the Attorney-General of Canada had the burden of demonstrating that, in the premises, the subject-matter of the disputed legislation had, for some special reason, been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe written submission of the Attorney-General of Canada, as it was made to this Court, was that the Acts were within the legislative power of the Parliament of Canada in their entirety in virtue of\n(1) its exclusive legislative power under sec. 132 of the British North America Act;\n(2) its general power, conferred by sec. 91 of the said Act, to perform the obligations of Canada under the several draft conventions duly ratified by Canada as a Member of the International Labour Organization;\n(3) its general power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada;\n(4) its exclusive legislative, authority in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce;\n(5) its exclusive legislative authority in relation to the criminal law.\nIt will only be necessary to consider the provisions contained in numbers 1 and 2 of the submission, for it seems to be evident that the subject-matter of the Acts is not criminal law (and the point was not pressed at the argument). As for the contention that the legislation may be supported as an exercise of the general power conferred by sec. 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, or of the exclusive legislative authority in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce, the discussion, both comprehensive and exhaustive of the extent of those powers made by my Lord the Chief Justice in his reasons on the Reference concerning The Natural Products Marketing Act (p. 403) relieves me of the necessity of examining these contentions here, for, to my mind, they establish conclusively that the Dominion Parliament cannot rely on these powers in support of the validity of the legislation under submission.\nIt will only be necessary, therefore, to scrutinize the arguments put forward by the Dominion Government that the Acts are valid as an exercise of the power \u201cnecessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or any province thereof \u2026 towards foreign countries, arising under the Draft Conventions duly ratified by Canada as a Member of the International Labour Organization.\u201d\nPart XIII of the Treaty of Versailles is entirely devoted to labour questions. Under it, a permanent organization is established for the promotion of the objects set forth in that part. The original members of this organization are the original members of the League of Nations. Canada is such a member.\nThe permanent organization consists of a General Conference of the representatives of the members and an International Labour Office controlled by a Governing Body.\nMeetings of the General Conference are held from time to time at which the Conference adopts proposals taking the form either (a) of a recommendation to be submitted to the members for consideration with a view to effect being given to it by national legislation or otherwise, or (b) of a draft international convention for ratification by the members.\nThe procedure is that, after the recommendation or draft convention has been identicated by the President and the Director of the Conference and after it has been deposited with the Secretary General of the League of Nations, the Secretary General is to communicate a certified copy to each of the members.\nAnd then, under article 405,\nEach of the Members undertakes that it will, within the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference, or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within the period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment and in no case later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.\nIn the case of a recommendation, the Members will inform the Secretary-General of the action taken.\nIn the case of a draft convention, the Member will, if it obtains the consent of the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, communicate the formal ratification of the convention to the Secretary-General and will take such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of such convention.\nIf on a recommendation no legislative or other action is taken to make a recommendation effective, or if the draft convention fails to obtain the consent of the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, no further obligation shall rest upon the Member.\nIn the case of a federal State, the power of which to enter into conventions on labour matters is subject to limitations, it shall be in the discretion of that Government to treat a draft convention to which such limitations apply as a recommendation only, and the provisions of this Article with respect to recommendations shall apply in such case.\nThe draft conventions here, by the Dominion Parliament, made the basis of the legislation now submitted to the Court were adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization under the provisions just mentioned.\nIt should be stated, only for the purpose of accuracy, that, notwithstanding the fact that the proposals were adopted at the first session of the International Labour Conference, at its first annual meeting (29th October-29th November, 1919), it was not until 1935\u2014and, therefore, sixteen years later\u2014that the Dominion Government and the Federal Parliament undertook to take any action in regard to them and to enact legislation in order to carry them out.\nUnder article 405 just quoted, a Member undertook to bring a recommendation or a draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies\u2014\nwithin the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference, or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within the period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment and in no case later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference.\nThis was not done; but it is claimed that the provision is directory only and that no consequence can follow from the fact that the delay prescribed in the order had long since expired when the Dominion Government took action and the Dominion Parliament undertook to pass this legislation.\nIn the meantime, however, a fact, to my mind of very great importance, had taken place.\nOn November 6, 1920, an Order in Council was passed on the report of the then Minister of Justice dealing in part with the obligations of the Dominion of Canada as a Member of the International Labour Conference with relation to the Draft Conventions or Recommendations which may from time to time be adopted by the Conference, so that appropriate legislative and other action may be taken to give effect to them. The opinion expressed by the Minister upon this point was set forth in the Order in Council. That opinion was\nthat the provisions of the Labour Part of the Treaty of Versailles do not impose any obligation on the Dominion of Canada to enact into law the different draft conventions or recommendations which may from time to time be adopted by the Conference.\nThe obligation as set forth is simply in the nature of an undertaking on the part of each Member to bring the recommendations or draft conventions before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation; or other action.\nIn the opinion of the Minister\nthe Government\u2019s obligation would be fully carried out if the different conventions and recommendations are brought before the competent authority, Dominion or Provincial, accordingly as it may appear, having regard to the scope and objects, the true nature and character of the legislation required to give effect to the proposals of the conventions and recommendations respectively that they fall within the legislative authority of the one or the other.\nThis Order in Council of the 6th November, 1920, also embodied the Minister\u2019s opinion upon the question whether the provisions of the Draft Convention limiting the hours of work in industrial undertakings came within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada or of the provincial legislature.\nThe Minister reported that the proposals of this Convention involve legislation which is competent to Parliament in as far as Dominion works and undertakings are affected, but which the provincial legislatures have otherwise the power to enact and apply generally and comprehensively.\nNotwithstanding the view expressed in the Order in Council of November 6, 1920, as doubt existed in certain quarters as to the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial authorities respectively, the Committee of the Privy Council of Canada, upon a report dated the 23rd December, 1924, from the Minister of Justice, considered it expedient that the question as to the respective powers of the Parliament of Canada and of the provincial legislature in relation to the enactment of the legislation required to give effect to the provisions of the said Draft Convention should be judicially determined; and accordingly the following questions were then referred to the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\n(1) What is the nature of the obligations of the Dominion of Canada as a member of the International Labour Conference, under the provisions of the Labour Part (Part XIII) of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding provisions of the other Treaties of Peace, with relation to such draft conventions and recommendations as may be from time to time adopted by the said Conference under the authority of and pursuant to the aforesaid provisions?\n(2) Are the legislatures of the provinces the authorities within whose competence the subject-matter of the said draft convention (The Limitation of the Hours of Work Act) in whole or in part lies before whom such draft convention should be brought, under the provisions of Article 405 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, for the enactment of legislation or other action?\n(3) If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only, within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, then in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the competence of the legislatures?\n(4) If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only, within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, then in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the competence of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe answers of the Court and the reasons for those answers are reported[21].\nTo the first question, the answer was that\nThe obligation is simply in the nature of an undertaking to bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action. To the second question, the answer was\nYes, in part.\nA reference to the reasons will show that the Court was unanimously of opinion that\nUnder the scheme of distribution of legislative authority in the British North America Act, legislative jurisdiction touching the subject-matter of this convention is, subject to a qualification to be mentioned, primarily vested in the provinces. * * * This general proposition is subject to this qualification, namely, that as a rule a province has no authority to regulate the hours of employment of the servants of the Dominion Government.\n* * *\nIt is necessary to observe, also, that as regards these parts of Canada which are not included within the limits of any province, the legislative authority in relation to civil rights generally, and to the subject-matter of the convention in particular, is the Dominion Parliament.\nThe answer to the third question was:\u2014\nThe subject-matter is generally within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, but the authority vested in these legislatures does not enable them to give the force of law to provisions such as those contained in the draft convention in relation to servants of the Dominion Government, or to legislate for these parts of Canada which are not within the boundaries of a province.\nThe answer to the fourth question was:\u2014\nThe Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority in those parts of Canada not within the boundaries of any province, and also upon the subjects dealt within the draft convention in relation to the servants of the Dominion Government.\nThe conclusion of the unanimous judgment of this Court in the matter was that\nthe draft Convention ought to be brought before the Parliament of Canada as being the competent legislative authority for those parts of Canada not within the boundaries of any province; and if servants of the Dominion Government engaged in industrial undertakings as defined by the convention are within the scope of its provisions, then the Dominion Parliament is the competent authority also to give force of law to those provisions as applicable to such persons.\nThe convention should also be brought before the Lieutenant-Governor of each of the provinces for the purpose of enabling him to bring it to the attention of the Provincial Legislature as possessing, subject to the qualification mentioned, legislative jurisdiction within the province in relation to the subject-matter of the convention.\nThe reference made in 1925 went no further and, therefore, the opinion then given may be regarded as binding upon this Court, except in so far as it may have been superseded by subsequent pronouncements of the Privy Council in the Reference concerning the regulation and control of Aeronautics in Canada (1)[22], and the Reference concerning the regulation and control of Radio communication in Canada[23]. On the points that we are now discussing I find it impossible to distinguish between The Limitation of the Hours of Work Act, which was the subject-matter of the reference of 1925 to this Court (again submitted in the present reference) and The Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, or The Minimum Wages Act.\nThese conventions are not treaties within the meaning of sec. 132 of the B.N.A. Act, more particularly as the word was understood at the time of the adoption of the Act by the Imperial Parliament. Moreover, they are not treaties between the Empire and Foreign Countries in respect of which \u201cobligations of Canada or of any province thereof as part of the British Empire towards foreign countries\u201d might have arisen. Consequently, sec. 132 in terms does not apply to these conventions.\nIt was decided, however, by the Privy Council on the Radio Reference[24], that certain class of conventions, of which Canada as a dominion was one of the signatories, not being mentioned explicitly in either sec. 91 or sec. 92 fell within the general words at the opening of sec. 91 assigning to the Parliament of the Dominion the power to make laws \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d And their Lordships \u201cin fine, though agreeing that the convention was not such a treaty as is defined in s. 132, thought that it comes to the same thing.\u201d\nBoth in the Aeronautics Reference[25] and in the Radio Reference24, however, the Privy Council, at the same time as it declared that the validity of the legislation could be supported as an exercise of the powers derived from sec. 132 or from the residuary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, also came to the conclusion that the subject of aeronautics and the subject of radio came under one or more of the enumerated heads of sec 91 of the B.N.A. Act, radio, moreover, belonging to such class of subjects as were expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by the Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces (91-29). I will have to make further observations on this point later on.\nAnother remark to be made in connection with the aeronautics and radio judgments in the Privy Council is that, in the former case, their Lordships were dealing with a treaty convention under sec. 132, and, in the latter case, they were dealing with a convention of a character quite different from those under submission and of which they said that it \u201ccomes to the same thing as a treaty.\u201d\nIt would seem to me, therefore, that these two decisions are not authorities upon the question of wherein lies as between the Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the Provinces the powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof arising out of conventions adopted by the International Labour Conference.\nBut on the present reference, as I view it, it is not necessary for this Court to enter into the discussion of this last point.\nWhether treaty or convention, the questions under consideration in the Aeronautics[26] and the Radio[27] references were concerned with the validity of legislation enacted for the purpose of performing obligations arising as a result of international agreements already made and the validity whereof was not disputed.\nIn those references, the question whether the treaty or convention had been properly and competently signed, adopted or ratified was not in question, either in this Court or in the Privy Council.\nNow, with deference, I make a very great distinction between the power to create an international obligation and the power to perform it when once it has been created.\nWe may leave aside the aeronautics and radio decisions, which were concerned merely with the validity of laws enacted for the purpose of performing foreign obligations, because in the present case what we have mainly to consider is the power to create foreign obligations. On that particular point, that is to say: on that point of where lies the power to create an international obligation, the only decision so far is the judgment of this Court on the reference. In the matter of legislative jurisdiction over hours of labour[28]. I fail to find anything in the subsequent judgments of the Privy Council superseding what was said unanimously by this Court on that subject. The authority, in my humble opinion, is as conclusive as it can be, since that reference was concerned with one of the draft conventions on which the Attorney General of Canada now seeks to rely in support of the validity of the legislation now submitted to us, and since no substantial distinction in the pertinent sense can be made between the draft convention then under consideration and the two other conventions dealing with The Weekly Rest and The Minimum Wages. With deference, I think the decision of 192528 is certainly binding on this Court and that, as a consequence, it must follow that the obligation of Canada with respect to these draft conventions is simply to bring them before the authority within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action, or, in the premises, before the legislatures of the provinces, except for the provisions of those draft conventions in relation to servants of the Dominion Government, or in relation to those parts of Canada which are not within the boundaries of a province.\nLet it be granted that under the scheme of the British North America Act the provinces of Canada were \u201cfederally united into one Dominion\u201d; that the Act provides for one nation, not for several nations; that the provinces have no status in international law, they are not States and are not recognized as such. Let it be conceded from these premises that the Government of Canada is the proper medium for all international relations and that \u201cfor international purposes, it should be regarded as a unity\u201d (Keith on Responsible Government in the Dominions, 1909, pp. 134-135). It seems to me that, having regard to the fundamental spirit of the Constitution, a distinction must necessarily be drawn between the competency to discharge international obligations and the competency to enter into them.\nWhile it is, no doubt, perfectly true that \u201coverwhelming convenience\u2014under the circumstances amounting to necessity\u201d (Anglin C.J.C. in the Radio Reference)[29], dictates the answers that the performance of obligations, both federal and provincial, arising out of international agreements must be left exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, I fail to see the same necessity with regard to the power to create these foreign obligations. When once they have been undertaken, Canada is in honour bound to perform them; but there is no necessity, nor even obligation, to undertake them. If the effect of the undertaking is that a subject of legislation within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province will thereby be transferred from that jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, I consider it to be within the clear spirit of the British North America Act that the obligation should not be created or entered into before the provinces have given their consent thereto. In the particular case that we are now considering, it is my humble view that such was the effect of the judgment of this Court in the matter of the Reference of 1925[30]. Such, it seems to me with respect, was the interpretation put by this Court upon the pertinent clause of article 405 of the Treaty of Peace.\nUnder the distribution of legislative powers, Property and Civil Rights in the Province were ascribed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature in each province.\nA civil right does not change its nature just because it becomes the subject-matter of a convention with foreign States. It continues to be the same civil right. When once the convention has been properly adopted and ratified, it is, no doubt, transferred to the federal field for the enactment of laws necessary or proper for performing the obligations arising under the convention. That is, as I understand it, the effect of the decisions of the Privy Council on the Aeronautics[31] and Radio[32] References. But before the international obligation has been properly and competently created, the civil right under the jurisdiction of the provinces is always the same civil right, and I cannot see where the Dominion Parliament in the British North America Act finds the power to appropriate it for the purpose of dealing with it internationally without having previously secured the consent of the provinces.\nIn the present cases, we are dealing with Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings, Minimum Wages in ordinary contracts of employment and Limitation of Hours of Work, matters which are fundamentally of the competence of the legislatures in each province. But in order to put the point more forcibly, let us assume that the subject matter of the convention was education, a subject in relation to which \u201cin and for each province the legislature may exclusively make laws\u201d (Sec. 93). Can it be said that it would be within the spirit of the Constitution that the Dominion Parliament might acquire exclusive jurisdiction over that very essential subject as a consequence of the fact that the Dominion Government would decide in regard to it to make a convention with a foreign power?\nIt might be objected that education would not be regarded as the proper subject matter of a treaty or an international convention as these arrangements are generally understood. Until comparatively recently, neither could it be said that questions affecting The Weekly Rest in Undertakings, The Minimum Wages or The Limitation of Hours of Work would be considered as proper subjects for international conventions.\nThe treaty-making power is the prerogative of the Crown. In ordinary practice, it is exercised on the recommendation of the Crown\u2019s advisers.\nIn Canada, the practice has grown gradually to enter into international conventions through the medium of the Governor in Council. It does appear that it would be directly against the intendment of the British North America Act that the King or the Governor General should enter into an international agreement dealing with matters exclusively assigned to the jurisdiction of the provinces solely upon the advice of the federal Ministers who, either by themselves or even through the instrumentality of the Dominion Parliament are prohibited by the Constitution from assuming jurisdiction over these matters.\nI would like to conclude with the words of Lord Watson, in the Maritime Bank case[33]:\nThe object of the Act was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate provincial governments to a central authority, but to create a federal government in which they should all be represented, entrusted with the exclusive administration of affairs in which they had a common interest, each province retaining its independence and autonomy. It follows from all that I have said that, in my opinion, the draft conventions upon which is based the legislation now submitted to us have not been properly and competently ratified, that they could not be so ratified without the consent of the legislature in each province, both by force of the British North America Act and upon the proper interpretation of article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles; and that, for that reason, the Acts now submitted are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nCannon J.\u2014When an Act of Parliament is challenged before this Court as unconstitutional, our duty is to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. Our only power is to announce our considered judgment upon the question. This Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Our delicate and difficult office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with or contravention of the provisions of the Constitution. Having done so, our duty ends.\nThe question is not what power the Federal Government ought to have, but what powers, in fact, have been given to it by the B.N.A. Act. It hardly seems necessary to reiterate that ours is a dual form of government; that in every province there are two governments. We differ radically from nations where all legislative power, without restriction, is vested in a parliament, or other legislative body, subject to no restriction.\nIt must also be borne in mind that the attainment of a prohibited end may not be accomplished under the pretext of the exercise of powers which are granted. We may accept as established doctrine that any provision in an Act of Parliament ostensibly enacted under power granted by the constitution not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power but solely to the achievement of something plainly within the provincial jurisdiction is invalid and cannot be enforced.\nNor can it help to declare that local conditions throughout the nation have created a situation of national concern; for this is but to say that whenever there is a widespread similarity of local conditions, Parliament may ignore constitutional limitations upon its own powers and usurp those reserved to the provinces. Until recently there was no suggestion of the existence of any such power in the Federal Parliament. The opinion of the framers of the Constitution, the decisions of the courts and the writings of commentators, deny to the Federal Parliament the authority whereby every provision and every fair implication from the B.N.A. Act may be subverted, the autonomy of the provinces obliterated and the Dominion of Canada converted into a central government exercising uncontrolled police power in every province, superseding all local control or regulation of the affairs of the province. It was never suggested that any power granted by the constitution to Parliament, or necessarily implied, could be used for the destruction of self-government in the provinces. It never occurred to any of the commentators that the general welfare of the Dominion might be served by obliterating the constituent provinces. It seems to be contended that, under the residual power for peace, order and good government, Parliament has power to tear down the barriers, to invade the provincial jurisdiction and to impose Legislative Union for the whole of Canada, subject to no restriction, save such as are self-imposed.\nThat the provinces agreed only to a Federal Union appears abundantly by a perusal of what was said by Sir J. A. Macdonald, then Attorney General of Upper Canada, before the Canadian Parliament sitting in the city of Quebec on the 6th February, 1865\nThe third and only means of solution for our difficulties was the junction of the provinces either in a Federal or a Legislative Union. Now, as regards the comparative advantages of a Legislative and a Federal Union, I have never hesitated to state my own opinions. I have again and again stated in the House, that, if practicable, I thought a Legislative Union would be preferable. I have always contended that if we could agree to have one government and one parliament, legislating for the whole of these peoples, it would be the best, the cheapest, the most vigorous, and the strongest system of government we could adopt. But, on looking at the subject in the Conference, and discussing the matter as we did, most unreservedly, and with a desire to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, we found that such a system was impracticable. In the first place, it would not meet the assent of the people of Lower Canada, because they felt that in their peculiar position\u2014being in a minority, with a different language, nationality and religion from the majority\u2014in case of a junction with the other provinces, their institutions and their laws might be assailed, and their ancestral associations, on which they prided themselves, attacked and prejudiced; it was found that any proposition which involved the absorption of the individuality of Lower Canada\u2014if I may use the expression\u2014would not be received with favour by her people. We found too, that though their people speak the same language and enjoy the same system of law as the people of Upper Canada, a system founded on the common law of England, there was as great a disinclination on the part of the various Maritime Provinces to lose their individuality, as political organizations, as we observed in the case of Lower Canada herself. Therefore, we were forced to the conclusion that we must either abandon the idea of union altogether, or devise a system of union in which the separate provincial organizations would be in some degree preserved. So that those who were, like myself, in favour of a Legislative Union, were obliged to modify their views and accept the project of a Federal Union as the only scheme practicable, even for the Maritime Provinces. Because, although the law of those provinces is founded on the common law of England, yet every one of them has a large amount of law of its own\u2014colonial law framed by itself, and affecting every relation of life, such as laws of property, municipal and assessment laws; laws relating to the liberty of the subject, and to all the great interests contemplated in legislation; we found, in short, that the statutory law of the different provinces was so varied and diversified that it was almost impossible to weld them into a Legislative Union at once. Why, sir, if you only consider the innumerable subjects of legislation peculiar to new countries, and that every one of those five colonies had particular laws of its own, to which its people have been accustomed and are attached, you will see the difficulty of effecting and working a Legislative Union, and bringing about an assimilation of the local as well as general laws of the whole of the provinces. We in Upper Canada understand from the nature and operation of our peculiar municipal law, of which we know the value, the difficulty of framing a general system of legislation on local matters which would meet the wishes and fulfil the requirements of the several provinces.\nThe whole scheme of Confederation, as propounded by the Conference, as agreed to and sanctioned by the Canadian Government, and as now presented for the consideration of the people and the Legislature, bears upon its face the marks of compromise. Of necessity there must have been a great deal of mutual concession.\nAs I stated in the preliminary discussion, we must consider this scheme in the light of a treaty.\nThe Conference having come to the conclusion that a legislative union, pure and simple, was impracticable, our next attempt was to form a government upon federal principles, which would give to the General Government the strength of a legislative and administrative union, while at the same time it preserved that liberty of action for the different sections which is allowed by a Federal Union. And I am strong in the belief that we have hit upon the happy medium in those resolutions, and that we have formed a scheme of government which unites the advantages of both, giving us the strength of a legislative union and the sectional freedom of a federal union, with protection to local interests.\nI shall not detain the House by entering into a consideration at any length of the different powers conferred upon the General Parliament as contradistinguished from those reserved to the local legislatures; but any honourable member on examining the list of different subjects which are to be assigned to the General and Local Legislatures respectively, will see that all the great questions which affect the general interests of the Confederacy as a whole, are confided to the Federal Parliament, while the local interests and local laws of each section are preserved intact, and entrusted to the care of the local bodies. As a matter of course, the General Parliament must have the power of dealing with the public debt and property of the Confederation. Of course, too, it must have the regulation of trade and commerce, of customs and excise. The Federal Parliament must have the sovereign power of raising money from such sources and by such means as the representatives of the people will allow. It will be seen that the local legislatures have the control of all local works; and it is a matter of great importance, and one of the chief advantages of the Federal Union and of local legislatures, that each province will have the power and means of developing its own resources and aiding its own progress after its own fashion and in its own way. Therefore, all the local improvements, all local enterprises or undertakings of any kind, have been left to the care and management of the local legislatures of each province.\nThe criminal law too\u2014the determination of what is a crime and what is not and how crime shall be punished\u2014is left to the General Government. This is a matter almost of necessity. It is of great importance that we should have the same criminal law throughout these provinces\u2014that what is a crime in one part of British America, should be a crime in every part\u2014that there should be the same protection of life and property as in another. It is one of the defects in the United States system, that each separate state has or may have a criminal code of its own,\u2014that what may be a capital offence in one state, may be a venial offence, punishable slightly, in another. But under our Constitution we shall have one body of criminal law, based on the criminal law of England, and operating equally throughout British America, so that a British American belonging to what province he may, or going to any other part of the Confederation, knows what his rights are in that respect, and what his punishment will be if an offender against the criminal laws of the land. I think this is one of the most marked instances in which we take advantage of the experience derived from our observations of the defects in the Constitution of the neighbouring Republic.\nAlthough, therefore, a legislative union was found to be almost impracticable, it was understood, so far as we could influence the future, that the first act of the Confederate Government should be to procure an assimilation of the statutory law of all those provinces, which has, as its root and foundation, the common law of England. But to prevent local interests from being over-ridden, the same section makes provision, that, while power is given to the General Legislature to deal with this subject, no change in this respect should have the force and authority of law in any province until sanctioned by the Legislature of that province.\nSir George Etienne Cartier closed his speech by stating:\nSo if these resolutions were adopted by Canada, as he had no doubt they would, and by the other Colonial Legislatures, the Imperial Government would be called upon to pass a measure which would have for its effect to give a strong central or general government and local governments, which would at once secure and guard the persons, the properties and the civil and religious rights belonging to the population of each section.\nThe British North America Act, in its preamble, says:\nWhereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom: Articles 3 and 4 provided for the proclamation of the Dominion, composed of four provinces Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; which preserved their identity and never ceased at any time to form distinct and separate governments. The provinces created, by their union, a new power; but it is impossible to say that they owe to it their existence. On the contrary, the provinces created the Dominion.\nLord Carnavon, in the House of Lords, on the second reading of the B.N.A. Act, said:\nA legislative union is under existing circumstances impracticable. The Maritime Provinces are ill-disposed to surrender their separate life, and to merge their individuality in the political organization of the general body. It is in their case, impossible, even if it were desirable, by a stroke of the pen to bring about a complete assimilation of their institutions to those of their neighbours. Lower Canada, too, is jealous, as she is deservedly proud, of their ancestral customs and traditions; she is wedded to her peculiar institutions, and will enter this Union only upon the distinct understanding she retains them.\nChief Justice Dorion, who had taken part, as a member of the legislature, in the Confederation debates, gave the following opinion quoted at page 143 of volume III of La Th\u00e9mis:\nThere is no difference between the powers of the local and Dominion legislatures within their own sphere. That is the powers of the local legislature within its own sphere are co-extensive with the powers of the Dominion government within its own sphere. The one is not inferior to the other. I find that the powers of the old legislature of Canada is extended to the local legislatures of the different provinces. We have a government modelled on the British constitution. We have responsible government in all provinces, and these powers are not introduced by legislators, but in conformity with usage. It is founded on the consent and recognition of those principles which guide the British constitution. I do not read that the new constitution was to begin an entirely new form of government, or to deprive the legislature of any of the powers which existed before, but to effect a division of them, some of them are given to the local legislatures, but I find none of them curtailed.\nIn substituting the new legislation to the old, the new legislature has, in all those things which are special to the province of Quebec, all the rights of the old legislature, and they must continue to remain in the province of Quebec, as they existed under the old constitution.\nAnd Sandborn, J., said:\nThe British North America Act of 1867 was enacted in response to the petition of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as stated in the preamble of the Act, to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. The powers of legislation and representative government upon the principle of the British constitution, or, as it has commonly been called, responsible government, were not new to Canada. They had been conceded to Canada and exercised in their largest sense from the time of the Union Act of 1840, and in a somewhat more restricted sense from the Act of 1791 to 1840. The late province of Lower Canada was constituted a separate province by the Act of 1791, with a governor, a legislative council and a legislative assembly, and it has never lost its identity. It had a separate body of laws, both as respects statute and common law, in civil matters no powers that had been conceded were intended to be taken away by the British North America Act of 1867, and none, in fact, were taken away, as it is not the wont of the British government to withdraw constitutional franchises once conceded. This Act, according to my understanding of it, distributed powers already existing to be exercised within their prescribed limits, to different legislatures constituting one central legislature and several subordinate ones, all upon the same model, without destroying the autonomy of the provinces, or breaking the continuity of the respective provinces, in a certain sense, the powers of the federal parliament were derived from the provinces, subject, of course, to the whole being a colonial dependency of the British Crown. The provinces of Quebec and Ontario are by the sixth section of the Act, declared to be the same that formerly comprised Upper and Lower Canada. This recognizes their previous existence prior to the Union Act of 1840. All through the Act, these provinces are recognized as having previous existence and a constitutional history upon which the new fabric is based. Their laws remain unchanged, and the constitution is preserved. The offices are the same in name and duties, except as to the office of lieutenant-governor, who is placed in the same relation to the province of Quebec, as that which the governor general sustained to the late province of Canada. I think it would be a great mistake to ignore the past government powers conferred upon and exercised in the province now called Quebec, in determining the nature and privileges of the legislative assembly of this province.\nThe procedure recommended by the Imperial Conferences in 1926 and 1930 regarding legislation or international agreements by one of the self-governing parts of the Empire which may affect the interests of other self-governing parts, i.e. previous consultation between His Majesty\u2019s ministers in the several parts concerned, should be applied by the central and provincial governments specially before ratifying any international agreement\u2014not falling under Section 132 of the B.N.A. Act. The only direct legislative authority expressly given to the Parliament and Government of Canada concerning foreign affairs is found in this section and is limited to the performance of the obligations of Canada or any province thereof arising under treaties between the Empire as a whole and a foreign country. The Imperial Parliament saw to it that Imperial interests would be protected by federal legislation. But to pass legislation\u2014affecting the provinces\u2014to ratify a treaty or agreement by Canada alone\u2014under an evolution which came to pass since Confederation\u2014with a foreign power, previous consultations between the federal and provincial self-governing parts of our Confederation seem to me logical and the only way to preserve peace, order and good government in Canada and save the very roots of the tree to which our constitution has been compared. In order to grow, if it be a growing instrument, it must keep contact with its native soil\u2014and draw from the constituting provinces new force and efficiency.\nThe provinces agreed to this principle of Legislative Union and the Imperial Parliament granted it to a central Parliament strictly within the ambit of 91; any legislation by this Parliament attempting to legislate uniformly for the whole of Canada on any subject exclusively retained by the provinces and within the natural and obvious meaning of section 92 must, in my opinion, be prima facie, considered as ultra vires of the Dominion.\nThe additions by some decisions to the powers of the Dominion in emergency cases must be applied, if at all, with the greatest caution. In the words of Sir John MacDonald, \u201cthe scheme must be considered in the light of a treaty\u201d not to be lightly interfered with by way of commentary and gloss.\nIf any changes are required to face new situations or to cope with the increased importance of Canada as a nation, they may be secured by an amendment to the Act; but neither this Court nor the Privy Council should be called upon to legislate in the matter by treating the constitution as a growing tree confided to their care. We have nothing to do with the growth or with the making of the law in constitutional matters. The Imperial Parliament alone can change what they enacted\u2014or add to it. New branches to acquire the force of law, must be embodied in the statute, not in judgments or commentaries.\nThe above considerations may be applied, mutatis mutandis, to all the acts referred to us for consideration, but I would add a few words with respect to the three acts based on the so-called Geneva Labour Conventions mentioned in Order in Council 3454, being chapters 14, 44 and 63 of the statutes of 1935.\nSuch labour conventions binding Canada independently from the rest of the Empire do not fall under 132; they were not even contemplated as feasible in 1867 when the B.N.A. Act was passed. Radio and aeronautics are also new matters not existing at that time and had to be dealt with by the Privy Council as outside the enumerated subjects of 91 and 92; and these two decisions must be considered as arr\u00eats d\u2019esp\u00e8ce and confined to the subject matters which both had necessarily interprovincial and international aspects.\nBut the payment of wages for labour, the weekly rest and the rate of wages and length of hours of work were well known subjects in 1867 and they were, by common agreement, reserved by the Imperial Parliament to the Provinces as purely local and private matters of property and civil rights.\nTherefore, in the words of section 405 of the treaty of Versailles. Canada as a federal state, has only a \u201cpower to enter into convention on labour matters subject to limitations\u201d and the draft convention should have been treated as a \u201crecommendation only.\u201d Such recommendation is to be submitted to the members for \u201cconsideration with a view to effect being given to it by national legislation or otherwise.\u201d The Versailles Treaty recognizes that in certain cases, effect can be given to a labour agreement \u201cotherwise\u201d than by national legislation.\nIn these cases, it does not appear that either the recommendations or the draft conventions were submitted to the provinces, i.e., the \u201cauthorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action.\u201d\nTo my mind, this is fatal to the validity of the ratification of these labour conventions by the Federal authorities.\nAs an internal matter, such changes in the respective constitutional powers of the provinces and of the Central Government cannot be jusified by invoking some clauses of the treaty of Versailles. Respect of their property and civil rights was guaranteed by the British Crown to the inhabitants of the original provinces as far back as the treaty of Paris in 1763; this was confirmed by the constitution of 1867 which cannot be changed in this essential part except by an Imperial statute, as plainly set forth in the Act of Westminster of 1931, sec. 7. It is not admissible that the Parliament and the Government of Canada could appropriate these powers, exclusively reserved to the provinces, by the simple process of ratifying a labour convention passed at Geneva with representatives of foreign countries. The framers of our constitution, and the Privy Council by their recent judgments in the Radio[34] and Aeronautics[35] cases never intended to plant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction. If such interference with provincial rights by way of international agreements is admitted as intra vires of the central government, we may as well say that we have in Canada a confederation in name, but a legislative union in fact. Uniformity is not in the spirit of our constitution. We have not a single community in this country. We have nine commonwealths, several different communities. This is the fact embodied in the law. It may be wise or unwise, according to the preferences and predilection of every one, but this is the basis of our constitution. Diversity is the basis of our constitution. The federative system was adopted in order to give to the provinces their autonomy and to secure, specially in Quebec, the rights to their own customs as crystallized in their civil law. No gloss or commentary to be found in judicial pronouncements can alter the constitution of this, country. It is a written document which can be amended or added to, only by legislation. No usage or judge made law can be invoked, no practice can be introduced to change the division of powers as set forth in 91 and 92, however desirable or opportune it may seem. If amendments are needed and asked for, they should be granted by the Imperial Parliament.\nIn 1867, it was found necessary in order to achieve confederation, to give us a federal form of government, more cumbersome and more expensive though it be, on account of the superior liberty it gives to the people.\nThis cannot be changed by the indirect way of a labour convention, in furtherance of some pious wish of the treaty of Versailles, at a time when its binding authority and wisdom is universally contested; and, albeit, many years after notification to Canada of these particular so-called draft conventions. The King\u2019s prerogative has not been used to do away with the statutory rights of His Canadian subjects.\nThese are not references to an international tribunal; we are not called upon to determine, in the absence of foreign powers, what effect such a ratification by the Canadian government might have in the international field. But Canada is not an independent sovereign state, and the Parliament of Canada is not a Parliament of unlimited authority. Every Parliament in Canada\u2014not only the Parliament of the Dominion, but also the legislature in each province\u2014is necessarily of limited authority, because it has not been given and does not possess the wide, the plenary authority over the whole field of legislation which is possessed by the Parliament of Great Britain or of an independent sovereign state. Upon the union\u2014upon the creation, not of one Parliament for Canada, but of one central Parliament and four provincial legislatures, each of them\u2014the central Parliament just as much as the others\u2014had limits to its jurisdiction, by the necessity of the case. That affords at once a very strong reason why no one of these parliaments should have jurisdiction over the Constitution of any other of them.\nIn 1867, when the agreement for entering into this Union was under discussion and being arrived at by the provinces, they wanted to create, and they did create by their agreement and by the statute which followed upon their agreement, a Parliament which was to have a limited jurisdiction, and no power to amend its Constitution.\nThese are some of the reasons why foreign powers, when dealing with Canada, must always keep in mind that neither the Governor General in Council, nor Parliament, can in any way, and specifically by an agreement with a foreign power, change the constitution of Canada or take away from the provinces their competency to deal exclusively with the enumerated subjects of section 92. Before accepting as binding any agreement under section 405 of the treaty of Versailles, foreign powers must take notice that this country\u2019s constitution is a federal, not a legislative union.\nCrocket J.\u2014It cannot be doubted that all these statutes, no matter from what point of view they are considered, embody legislation which is directly aimed at the regulation and control of contracts of employment, private as well as public, in every Province of the Dominion, and thus deal in a very real and radical sense with civil rights in all the provinces of Canada alike. The fundamental question before us, therefore, is: Can any authority be found within the four corners of the B.N.A. Act for the exercise of such legislative power by the Parliament of Canada?\nIn my opinion none of the draft conventions of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations, upon the ratification of which by the Government of Canada it has been sought to justify the enactment of all this legislation, fall within the terms of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. That section provides:\u2014\nThe Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any Province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nThe powers granted by this section are strictly limited to the performance of obligations towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries. Unquestionably the section does not embrace obligations arising under any form of convention or agreement entered into by the Government of Canada with the Government of any other country within the Empire, nor does it contemplate or suggest any form of convention or agreement with the Government of any foreign country other than a treaty in the true sense of the term. As Lord Dunedin pointed out in the Radio case[36], the idea of Canada as a Dominion being bound by a convention equivalent to a treaty with foreign powers was unthought of in 1867, when the B.N.A. Act was enacted, and the only class of treaty, which would bind Canada, was thought of as a treaty by Great Britain, that is to say, as I understand the reference, a treaty concluded by the Crown in the exercise of its prerogative as the sovereign of a single indivisible Empire on the advice of its constitutional advisers, the Imperial Government of Great Britain. Only by the exercise of this supreme authority could any treaty obligation be imposed on Canada or any other Dominion or dependency of the British Empire towards foreign nations within the intendment of the B.N.A. Act. The executive government and authority of and over Canada were expressly declared by s. 9 of the B.N.A. Act \u201cto continue and be vested in the Queen,\u201d s. 2 having already declared that the provisions of the Act referring to Her Majesty the Queen extend also to the Heirs and Successors of Her Majesty, Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. There can hardly be a doubt that in the minds of the Fathers of Confederation and the framers of the B.N.A. Act the British Empire was visualized only as a single unit and not as a collection or commonwealth of separate nations, each of equal status with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with authority to conclude either treaties, or conventions analogous to treaties, on its own account with any foreign government. For my part I am unable to comprehend how any international convention, to which Canada in its new status, whatever that status may actually be, purports to become a party as a separate government, or any obligation resulting therefrom, can possibly be brought within the terms of s. 132\u2014much less a mere draft convention, such as those of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations. To my mind there is nothing which the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Radio case[37] has more decisively settled than this: that if the Government of Canada by its own plenipotentiaries enters into an international convention with the Government of any other country, whether British or foreign, s. 132 cannot be relied upon as empowering the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation for the carrying out of any obligation arising under such a convention, and that, if such legislative power exists at all, it must be found, either under the enumerated heads of s. 91 or the introductory words of that section, the so-called residuary clause.\nEven if the Treaty of Versailles were a treaty between the British Empire, as an undivided unit, and those foreign states, whose plenipotentiaries signed it, which I do not think it is, and not a treaty purporting to have been entered into by the self-governing Dominions of the Empire as separate governments, it could not, in my judgment, be said that there was any obligation, for the performance of which the Parliament of Canada was empowered within the terms of s. 132 to enact legislation as pertaining to an obligation imposed by that treaty upon Canada or any province thereof, as part of the British Empire. The obligation arose directly from a so-called international convention, purporting to have been ratified by Canada as a separate and distinct Government\u2014an idea which is wholly incompatible with the conception of the Dominion of Canada as constituted by the B.N.A. Act.\nAs regards the residuary clause of s. 91, this empowers the Parliament of Canada\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nIt will be seen at once that this provision can only be invoked where the real subject-matter of the legislation does not fall within the classes of subjects which are exclusively assigned to the provinces by s. 92. To meet this obvious and formidable difficulty the learned counsel for the Dominion brought forward the much canvassed double aspect principle, by which, as I understand it, a matter, though it relates in one aspect and in some circumstances to a class of subjects, which is exclusively assigned by s. 92 to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, may nevertheless in another aspect and in other circumstances assume such nation-wide importance as to completely lose its original and normal identity within the purview of s. 92, and thus become at any time a matter falling within the general residuary clause of s. 91.\nIt was strongly argued that hours of work and the standard of wages and of living had attained such importance as subjects of legislation in Canada as to affect the body politic of the Dominion as a whole and thus to justify the Parliament of Canada in dealing with them in that aspect as matters demanding the intervention of Dominion legislation \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada,\u201d notwithstanding that the general authority to make laws so plainly excludes all subject-matters coming within the scope of s. 92.\nNo doubt there have been pronouncements in the Privy Council which lend much colour to this argument, but I do not think that they can property be interpreted as going to such a length as is now contended for. The learned Chief Justice has discussed very fully in dealing with the reference on the Natural Products Marketing Act (p. 403) the argument which was put forward in behalf of the Dominion in this regard and I feel that I can add nothing to what he has said. There is certainly no authoritative decision to the effect that, once it is seen that the real subject-matter of a legislative enactment pertains in all its predominant characteristics to the regulation and control of civil rights in the provinces, it can rightfully be transferred to the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada in virtue of the introductory words of s. 91 as a matter of legislation \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada\u201d in disregard of the plain and all important proviso that such jurisdiction may be exercised only in relation to matters \u201cnot coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\u201d I cannot refrain from reiterating these cogent observations of Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[38]:\nTo attach any other construction to the general power which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, is conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91, would, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces. If it were once conceded that the Parliament of Canada has authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion, in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject enumerated in s. 92 upon which it might not legislate, to the exclusion of the provincial legislatures.\nThese observations, it seems to me, present a conclusive answer to the argument which has been so strongly urged upon us in reference to the so-called double aspect principle. They demonstrate at least that the mere fact that Dominion legislation concerning any particular matter may be stated to be for the general advantage of Canada, or that the subject of the legislation has become as much a matter of national as of provincial concern to the several provinces, is not sufficient to remove that subject from the sphere of s. 92, to which in its normal and domestic aspect it primarily belongs, and transfer it to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under s. 91. It is true that local works and undertakings may be declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces, and that, when Parliament makes such a declaration with respect to any such local work or undertaking, it may lawfully legislate in relation to it, but that is in virtue of the exceptions which are expressly made in enumerated head, no. 10, of s. 92, and the consequent application of, enumerated head, no. 29 of s. 91 to such a work or undertaking.\nNor do I think that any authoritative decision can rightly be interpreted as warranting the conclusion that, once it appears that the real purpose and effect of a Dominion enactment is to interfere with private and civil rights in the provinces and that in that aspect it consequently falls within the sphere of legislation which has been exclusively reserved for the provinces, not only by the provisions of s. 92, but by the saving clause in the introduction of s. 91, such an enactment can possibly be justified under the general authority conferred on the Parliament of Canada. If such legislation could be maintained on the ground that it was for the peace, order and good government of Canada, it could only be by ignoring the explicit limitation, which is placed on the so-called general authority by the residuary clause itself with the obvious intention of preventing its application in the very sense now contended for, and thus protecting the provinces in the full enjoyment of their exclusive legislative rights as permanently guaranteed to them by s. 91.\nIt may be that in the event of the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole being so menaced by some outstanding national peril as to render the intervention of the Dominion Parliament necessary as the only adequate means of meeting such an emergency, the Courts will not shrink from holding that such an emergency constitutes a subject-matter of legislation which is quite outside the purview of s. 92 and the limitation which the saving clause of s. 91 imposes on the general authority of the Parliament of Canada to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the country as a whole, but, apart from such considerations, I question very much if there has been any really conclusive judicial recognition of the double aspect principle relied upon. If there be any such conclusive authority, to which we are bound to give effect in this case, then, as was suggested by the Attorney General of Ontario, the provinces may as well bid adieu to s. 92, reinforced by the saving limitation in the residuary clause of s. 91, as the unassailable charter of their legislative rights. I entirely concur in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice that there is nothing in the judgment in the Aeronautics case[39] of 1931 to indicate that the Lords of the Privy Council intended to detract from the judicial authority of decisions in the Combines case[40] and Snider\u2019s case[41], and that we are bound by those decisions, as well as the decision in the Fort Frances case[42], to hold that the legislation now in question, considered apart from the question of the performance of obligations arising out of binding international conventions, as distinguished from treaties proper within the meaning of s. 132, cannot be supported as legislation enacted for the peace, order and good government of Canada under the introductory clause of s. 91.\nThis brings me to a consideration of the further question as to whether the ratification by the Government of Canada of such draft international labour conventions as those of the General Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations, which themselves imposed no obligation of any kind upon the Government of Canada or any other government represented in that organization to give legislative effect or even to assent to any of them, can itself have the effect of vesting in the Parliament of Canada legislative jurisdiction which otherwise it would not possess under the B.N.A. Act.\nIt is said that we must now take it as settled by the decisions in the Aeronautics39 and Radio[43] cases that international conventions and all obligations arising therefrom are matters which fall within the general authority of Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to matters not coming within the classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the legislatures of the provinces. If this means that, once the Government of Canada has concluded a convention with the Government of any other country, whether within or without the British Empire, that fact itself operates to exclude the subject-matter of the convention from s. 92, regardless of the fact that that subject-matter admittedly up to the time of the conclusion of the convention came within one or more of the classes of subjects exclusively assigned by that section to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, I do not think that either of these cases, upon which counsel for the Dominion have so much relied, can properly be said to have laid down any such principle.\nAs to the Aeronautics decision[44], the legislation, which the Judicial Committee there considered, was s. 4 of the, Aeronautics Act, c. 3, Revised Statutes of Canada, which reproduced with an amendment the provisions of the Air Board Act, c 11 of the statutes of Canada (1919). Lord Sankey L.C., who delivered the judgment of the Board, explained that the Air Board Act was enacted by the Parliament of Canada in 1919 with a view to performing her obligations as part of the British Empire under a convention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, which was signed by the representatives of the allied and associated powers in the Great War, including Canada, and was ratified by His Majesty on behalf of the British Empire on June 1, 1922, and at the time of the hearing was in force between the British Empire and seventeen other nations. \u201cBy article 1,\u201d he said,\nthe high contracting parties recognize that every Power (which includes Canada) has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its territory; by article 40, the British Dominions and India are deemed to be States for the purpose of this Convention.\nThe Lord Chancellor then stated some of the principal obligations undertaken by Canada as part of the British Empire under the stipulations of the convention. Some of these undoubtedly affected civil rights in the provinces. The real grounds of the decision appear in the following passage, which I reproduce from p. 77 (1):\nTo sum up, having regard (a) to the terms of s. 132; (b) to the terms of the Convention which covers almost every conceivable matter relating to aerial navigation; and (c) to the fact that further legislative powers in relation to aerial navigation reside in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of s. 91, items 2, 5. and 7, it would appear that substantially the whole field of legislation in regard to aerial navigation belongs to the Dominion. There may be a small portion of the field which is not by virtue of specific words in the British North America Act vested in the Dominion; but neither is it vested by specific words in the Provinces. As to that small portion it appears to the Board that it must necessarily belong to the Dominion under its power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. Further their Lordships are influenced by the facts that the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under s. 132 are matters of national interest and importance and that aerial navigation is a class of subject which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion. As Viscount Dunedin, who sat in the Aeronautics case[45], pointed out in delivering the judgment of the Board in the Radio case[46] three or four months later, the leading consideration in the judgment of the Board in the earlier case was that the subject fell within the provisions of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. Apart from this, however, and the character of the Aerial Navigation Convention, it is clear that\nthe fact that further legislative powers in relation to aerial navigation reside in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of s. 91, items 2, 5 and 7 and (that) it would appear that substantially the whole field of legislation in regard to aerial navigation belongs to the Dominion, and further,\nthe facts that the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under s. 132 are matters of national interest and importance; and that aerial navigation is a class of subject which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion,\nalso influenced their Lordships.\nWhichever one of the different reasons assigned by the Board for the decision may have been regarded by their Lordships as the predominating reason, it seems to me that the judgment cannot, in any view, be interpreted as definitely laying down the principle that obligations arising out of all conventions between governments, not falling within the terms of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act, are matters, which, as subjects of legislation, cannot fall within s. 92, regardless of the form and character of the conventions themselves, and regardless also of whether they wholly or predominantly deal with matters which otherwise would unquestionably fall within one or more of the classes of subjects which that section reserves exclusively for the provincial legislatures. That their Lordships did not intend to lay down any uniform rule of such far-reaching consequences is shown by the following passage from the judgment itself:\u2014\nUnder our system decided cases effectively construe the words of an Act of Parliament and establish principles and rules whereby its scope and effect may be interpreted. But there is always a danger that in the course of this process the terms of the statute may come to be unduly extended and attention may be diverted from what has been enacted to what has been judicially said about the enactment.\nTo borrow an analogy; there may be a range of sixty colours, each of which is so little different from its neighbour that it is difficult to make any distinction between the two, and yet at the one end of the range the colour may be white, and at the other end of the range black. Great care must therefore be taken to consider each decision in the light of the circumstances of the case in view of which it was pronounced, especially . in the interpretation of an Act such as the British North America Act, which was a great constitutional charter, and not to allow general phrases to obscure the underlying object of the Act, which was to establish a system of government upon essentially federal principles. Useful as decided cases are, it is always advisable to get back to the words of the Act itself and to remember the object with which it was passed.\nInasmuch as the Act embodies a compromise under which the original Provinces agreed to federate, it is important to keep in mind that the preservation of the rights of minorities was a condition on which such minorities entered into the federation, and the foundation upon which the whole structure was subsequently erected. The process of interpretation as the years go on ought not to be allowed to dim or to whittle down the provisions of the original contract upon which the federation was founded, nor is it legitimate that any judicial construction of the provisions of ss. 91 and 92 should impose a new and different contract upon the federating bodies.\nNor do I think that the Radio case[47] goes to the length which has been suggested. On the latter reference the legislation considered was the Radiotelegraph Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 195, and the regulations made thereunder, the validity of which the Dominion sought to support on the ground that it was necessary to make provision for performing the obligations of Canada under the Radiotelegraph convention, as well as upon the ground that it was enacted by reason of the expediency of making provision for the regulation of a service essentially important in itself as touching closely the national life and interest.\nThis convention was the outcome of a meeting of representatives of about 80 countries, including the Dominion of Canada, held in Washington in November, 1927, to settle international agreements on the subject of radiotelegraph communication. The representatives of Canada had been appointed by the Privy Council of Canada with the approval of the Governor General, and the convention was actually signed by these representatives of Canada with the other signatories as plenipotentiaries of the countries named as the high contracting parties. By article 2 the contracting governments undertook to apply the provisions of the convention in all radio communication stations established or operated by the contracting governments, and open to the international service of public correspondence, and also to adopt or to propose to their respective legislatures the measures necessary to impose the observance of the provisions of the convention and the regulations annexed thereto upon individual persons and enterprises authorized to establish and operate radio communication stations and international service, whether or not the stations are open to public correspondence.\nThe Board, while holding that this convention was not a treaty within the meaning of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act, did no doubt decide that it was a convention by which Canada must be deemed to have been as firmly bound as if had been entered into as a formal treaty with foreign governments, and that Canada as a whole was amenable to the other signatory powers for the proper carrying out of the convention, for the reason apparently, as Lord Dunedin pointed out in the passage quoted by the learned Chief Justice from the Board\u2019s judgment[48] that Canada as a Dominion is one of the signatories to the convention. It is nowhere suggested in the judgment that either the fact of the Government of Canada being a signatory to the convention by its duly accredited plenipotentiaries or the fact of the Government of Canada having afterwards formally ratified the convention, clothed the Parliament of Canada with any legislative authority beyond that which flows from the provisions of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe point of the reference to the subject of international conventions and the changes in the status of the Government of Canada in relation to the Imperial Government was, as I take it, to show that the idea of Canada as a Dominion being bound by a convention equivalent to a treaty with foreign powers was unthought of in 1867, when the B.N.A. Act was enacted, and that consequently the subject of international conventions could not be expected to be mentioned explicitly in the Imperial statute in either ss. 91 or 92. \u201cThe only class of treaty,\u201d said Lord Dunedin,\nwhich would bind Canada was thought of as a treaty by Great Britain and that was provided for by s. 132. Being, therefore, not mentioned explicitly in either s. 91 or s. 92, such legislation falls within the general words at the opening of s. 91, which assigned to the Government of the Dominion the power to make laws \u201cfor the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\u201d In fine, though agreeing that the convention was not such a treaty as is defined in s. 132, their Lordships think that it comes to the same thing,\nthat is to say, as I understand it, that the fact of international conventions not having been specifically named in s. 92 among the classes of subjects in relation to which the Provinces are authorized to exclusively make laws, that subject necessarily falls within the residuary clause of s. 91 as a matter \u201cnot coming within\u201d any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92. This no doubt may, as their Lordships suggest, amount to the same thing as if the Radiotelegraph convention were in fact such a treaty as is defined in s. 132 in the sense that from the Dominion standpoint it makes no practical difference whether the Parliament of Canada derives its power to enact legislation for the carrying out of the stipulations of an international convention from the provisions of s. 132 or from the fact that the legislation is treated as a matter which does not come within the classes of subjects specified in s. 92, and must therefore fall within the residuary clause of s. 91. I do not think, however, that their Lordships intended to lay it down as an infallible rule for the interpretation of either s. 92 or of the residuary clause of s. 91 itself that the fact that a matter demanding legislative action is not mentioned explicitly in s. 92 decisively excludes it from such a comprehensive class of subjects as is specified in no. 13 of that section\u2014Property and Civil Rights.\nThe rest of the judgment shows that in addition to the fact of the Government of Canada being a signatory to the convention the Board considered the scope of its stipulations to see whether in their main features they dealt with a subject matter which in reality fell within any of the classes of subjects specified in s. 92, or whether they did not predominantly relate to classes of subjects set out in the enumerated heads of s. 91. Discussing the argument of the province that the convention did not touch the consideration of interprovincial broadcasting, Lord Dunedin says that much the same might have been said as to aeronautics, as it was (quite possible to fly without going outside the province, yet that was not thought to disturb the general view, and that\nthe idea pervading that judgment is that the whole subject of aeronautics is so completely covered by the treaty ratifying the convention between the nations, that there is not enough left to give a separate field to the provinces as regards the subject.\nAgain, His Lordship says:\nBut the question does not end with the consideration of the convention. Their Lordships draw special attention to the provisions of head 10 of s. 92. These provisions, as has been explained in several judgments of the Board, have the effect of reading the excepted matters into the preferential place enjoyed by the enumerated subjects of s. 91.\nTheir Lordships held that broadcasting fell within the excepted matters as being an undertaking connecting one province with another, and extending beyond the limits of the province and therefore came within enumerated head 29 of s. 91. \u201cOnce it is conceded,\u201d he went on to say,\nas it must be, keeping in view the duties under the convention, that the transmitting instrument must be, so to speak, under the control of the Dominion, it follows in their Lordships\u2019 opinion that the receiving instrument must share its fate. The receiver is indeed useless without a transmitter and can be reduced to a nonentity if the transmitter closes. The system cannot be divided into two parts each independent of the other.\nTheir Lordships, moreover, held that broadcasting fell within the description of \u201ctelegraphs,\u201d which subject is excepted from \u201clocal works and undertakings,\u201d specified in s. 92 (10), and therefore takes its place in 91 (29). In conclusion, Lord Dunedin said:\nAs their Lordships\u2019 views are based on what may be called the preeminent claims of s. 91, it is unnecessary to discuss the question which was raised with great ability by Mr. Tilley\u2014namely, whether, if there had been no pre-eminent claims as such, broadcasting could have been held to fall either within \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d or within \u201cmatters of a merely local or private nature.\u201d\nIt appears, therefore, to me that, while one of the grounds of the decision in the Radio case:[49] was the form and nature of the convention itself, the basis of the decision, as put in the judgment itself, was \u201cthe pre-eminent claims of s. 91,\u201d which, I take it to refer to the fact that the subject matter of that convention fell under one of the enumerated heads of s. 91, viz: no. 29. For that reason the authority of Parliament in relation to the subject matter of the convention and of the legislation would override the legislative authority of the provinces in relation thereto, not because of the residuary clause in the introduction of that section, but in virtue of the declaration that,\nnotwithstanding anything in this Act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects\nset forth in the 29 enumerated heads of that section, and the closing words of s. 91 as well that,\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThis, as I read the judgment, is the fundamental basis of the decision. Read in this light, it may truly be said to get back to the words of the B.N.A. Act itself and the object with which it was passed, and thus to avoid the danger to which the Board itself so pointedly called attention in the Aeronautics case[50] a few months earlier, of the provisions of such a great constitutional charter being so extended or whittled down in the process of judicial interpretation as the years go on as to impose a new and different contract upon the federating bodies than that upon which the whole structure of confederation was erected.\nWhile I agree with the learned Chief Justice that the Government of Canada must now be held to be the proper medium for the formal conclusion of international conventions, whether they affect the Dominion as a whole or any of the provinces separately, I do not think that this fact can be relied on as altering in any way the provisions of the B.N.A. Act as regards the distribution of legislative power as between the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures or as necessarily giving to any matter, which may be made the subject of legislation in Canada, any other meaning or aspect than that which it bears in our original constitution. Whether such a matter is one which falls under the terms of either s. 91 or of s. 92 or of s. 132, must depend upon the real intendment of the B.N.A. Act itself, as gathered from the terms of those sections and the Act as a whole. The original division of legislative power as between the two fields, Dominion and provincial, has remained inviolate to this day, so far as the Imperial Parliament is concerned. The Statute of Westminster itself provides by s. 7 (1) that, Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the B.NA. Act (1867 to 1930) or to any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\nAnd by s.s. (3) thereof that,\nThe powers conferred by this Act upon the Parliament of Canada or upon the Legislatures of the Provinces shall be restricted to the enactment of laws in relation to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the Legislatures of the Provinces respectively.\nSeeing that s. 92 so unequivocally assigns all \u201cmatters coming within the classes of subjects\u201d enumerated therein to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, and that the residuary clause of s. 91 is so unequivocally limited to \u201cmatters not coming within the classes of subjects\u201d assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures, I cannot understand how in a controversy as to which of the two legislative fields any particular matter belongs we can look at it otherwise than in its normal aspect within the intendment of these two sections as a subject of legislation, either for the Parliament of Canada or for the provincial legislatures. In such a controversy the primary duty of the Court is to determine whether the real subject matter of the legislation relates to one or more of the classes of subjects which the Act exclusively assigns to the provincial legislatures.\nSurely it was never within the contemplation of the Act that the Courts in determining this question should disregard the normal aspect of any matter in its relation to any of these classes of subjects, or that, because through the instrumentality of the Government of Canada in the exercise of its executive authority and functions, it should become the subject matter of an international convention, it should thereby cease to have any relationship to any of the classes of subjects, which the Act has defined as the exclusive prerogative of the legislatures of the provinces and should henceforth be looked at solely from an international point of view. For my part I find it quite impossible to accept such a proposition. If we are not bound by the Aeronautics and Radio decisions[51] to hold that legislation, which admittedly is directly aimed at the regulation and control of such matters as contracts of employment in respect of the limitation of the hours of labour and the rates of wages in all the provinces alike, is legislation relating to a matter which falls to the Parliament of Canada under the residuary clause of s. 91, simply because it has become a matter of national as well as of provincial concern, I can see no logical reason why we are bound to hold that such legislation exclusively vests in the Dominion simply because it relates to a matter which the federal executive has chosen to make a subject matter of an international convention. Both reasons are in my judgment alike irreconcilable with the clear intendment of s. 92 and the residuary clause of s. 91.\nAs to the suggestion that the fact that s. 92 makes no explicit mention of international conventions necessarily excludes the subject from the ambit of that section and places it in that of the residuary clause, this also in my opinion is wholly inadmissible as being contrary to the plain wording of both sections. Incontrovertibly the residuary clause itself limits the authority of the Dominion Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada to matters, which do not come within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively by the Act to the legislatures of the provinces. No matter, which does come within any of these classes of subjects, can legitimately be brought within the operation of the residuary power. There is but one test for determining its application or non-application to any given subject-matter, viz: Does the matter come within any of the classes of subjects, which the Act has assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces? And for the reasons already discussed the given matter must be looked at in its relationship, not to any outside country, but in its relationship to the classes of subjects definitely marked out as the exclusive legislative field of the provinces. The words of the enactment are \u201cmatters not coming within the classes of subjects\u201d assigned exclusively to the provinces\u2014not \u201cmatters not explicitly mentioned in s. 92.\u201d Manifestly many matters may not be explicitly mentioned in the classes of subjects assigned to the provinces and yet unquestionably come within those classes of subjects, particularly such wide and comprehensive classes of subjects as nos. 13 and 16: Property and Civil Rights and \u201cGenerally, all matters of a merely local or private nature.\u201d It seems to me that nothing could be more surely calculated to undermine the whole structure of the confederation compact as expressed in the B.N.A. Act in relation to the distribution of legislative power between the Dominion and provincial legislatures than the adoption of such a guide as has been suggested for the interpretation of these all important sections, 91 and 92. It would strip the legislative charter of the provinces of every vestige of permanency and stability and leave it at all times subject to the will and pleasure of the federal executive.\nThe legislation embodied in these three statutes is admittedly legislation which the Parliament of Canada would never have ventured to enact but for the draft conventions of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations. These conventions are admittedly conventions, to which the Government of Canada was in no manner bound to assent or to formally ratify. They were submitted to the Government of this country as mere draft conventions, and stood as such until 1935, when the Government of Canada chose to approve them, several years after the expiration of the period fixed by article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles for their submission \u201cto the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action.\u201d It was argued that this provision of article 405 was merely directory. I think its language is clearly mandatory, and that the ratification of the conventions, upon which these three statutes purport to be founded is null and void under the terms of article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles itself. It is, however, to the provisions of the B.N.A. Act, not to terms of the Treaty of Versailles, that we must look for the answers to the questions submitted to us on this reference concerning the constitutionality of these three statutes. In my opinion they are all wholly ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, for the reasons above stated.\n* Reporter\u2019s note: Counsel on the argument of this Reference were the same as those mentioned at p. 365.\n[1] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[2] [1896] A.C. 542.\n[3] [1923] A.C. 450.\n[4] [1924] A.C. 203.\n[5] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[6] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[7] [1932] A.C. 54, at 73, 74, 76, 77.\n[8] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[9] [1932] A.C. 304, at 311.\n[10] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[11] [1932] A.C. 304, at 311.\n[12] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[13] [1932] A.C. 304.\n12 [1932] A.C. 54.\n[14] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[15] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[16] [1925] S.C.R. 505.\n[17] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[18] [1932] A.C. 304.\n17 [1932] A.C. 54.\n18 [1932] A.C. 304.\n[19] [1924] A.C. 203.\n[20] [1932] A.C. 54 and 304.\n[21] [1925] S.C.R. 505.\n[22] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[23] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[24] [1932] A.C. 304, at 312.\n[25] [1932] A.C. 54.\n24 [1932] A.C. 304, at 312.\n[26] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[27] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[28] [1925] S.C.R. 505.\n28 [1925] S.C.R. 505.\n[29] [1931] S.C.R. 541, at 545, 546.\n[30] [1925] S.C.R. 505.\n[31] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[32] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[33] [1892] A.C. 437, at 441.\n[34] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[35] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[36] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[37] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[38] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[39] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[40] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[41] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[42] [1923] A.C. 695.\n39 [1932] A.C. 54.\n[43] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[44] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[45] [1932] A.C. 54.\n[46] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[47] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[48] [1932] A.C. 304, at 312.\n[49] [1932] A.C. 304.\n[50] [1932] A.C., 54.\n[51] [1932] A.C. 54 and 304.\n",

Whitzman, [1936] S.C.R. 539\nDate: 1936-05-27\nLouis Deitcher and Jacob Deitcher, doing business under the firm name and style of Deitcher Brothers (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nMyer Whitzman and Edward Whitzman (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1936: April 28, 29; 1936: May 27.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC.\nContract\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Contract for sale of scrap steel, accumulated on a certain wharf, to be loaded there on ship\u2014Clause providing that weight of goods be ascertained by checking ship\u2019s draft\u2014Subsequent arrangement for transferring goods and loading at different place\u2014Change in circumstances\u2014Conduct of parties\u2014Dispute as to weight of goods loaded\u2014Method of ascertainment\u2014Evidence to prove weight.\nDefendants contracted to purchase from plaintiffs certain scrap steel, part of which was on a wharf at Dartmouth and part at Halifax, and which was to be loaded on a steamer chartered by defendants. The contract provided: \u201cRailway weights to govern settlement on all material loaded in Halifax. For material loaded in Dartmouth, weight to be obtained in accordance with ship\u2019s draft. [Plaintiffs] have the right to appoint Lloyd\u2019s Agents to act on [plaintiffs\u2019] behalf as regards to checking the draft for weight purposes, and [defendants] are appointing ship\u2019s chief officer for the same purpose.\u201d The intention that the steamer should take on the Dartmouth cargo from said Dartmouth wharf was frustrated by the ship captain\u2019s fears that there was not sufficient depth of water for that to be done safely. The parties then made an agreement whereby the Dartmouth scrap was loaded into lighters and transported to the ship\u2019s side at a pier in Halifax. It was loaded and stowed in the steamer from these lighters while the Halifax scrap was being put on from the pier. Plaintiffs did nothing as to checking the ship\u2019s draft, nor did defendants or the ship\u2019s officer notify them that the draft was to be checked for the purpose of ascertaining the weight of the Dartmouth scrap. The main dispute was as to the weight of the scrap brought from Dartmouth, to prove which weight the plaintiffs at the trial adduced evidence of the lightermen and others. The jury\u2019s finding of the weight was in plaintiffs\u2019 favour, and judgment was given accordingly, which was affirmed on appeal. Defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: In the circumstances the above quoted weight clause respecting the Dartmouth scrap in the original contract could not fairly be held to have been incorporated as an implied term of the new arrangement made for its loading: checking its weight by the displacement method within the true meaning of said weight clause became impossible owing to the simultaneous loading (which the clause could not be taken as contemplating) of Halifax and Dartmouth scrap at Halifax; further, the clause contemplated concurrent checking and raised a duty in each party to co-operate with the other in the checking of the draft. It was therefore competent to plaintiffs to prove by the best available testimony the weight of the Dartmouth scrap actually delivered; and the evidence adduced warranted the jury\u2019s finding.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, [1936] 1 D.L.R. 780, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] affirming (Ross J. dissenting) the judgment of Hall J. at trial, on findings of a jury, in favour of the plaintiffs. The action was mainly for the price of goods sold and delivered, and the main question in dispute was the quantity (weight in tons) of scrap steel delivered by plaintiffs to defendants. The material facts of the case and questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nD. McInnes and S. E. Schwisberg for the appellants.\nJ. A. Walker K.C. for the respondents.\nDuff C.J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014The defendants, a firm of Montreal exporters, entered into a contract in writing with the plaintiffs, junk dealers of Halifax, in May, 1934, for the purchase of approximately 1,500 tons of scrap steel at the price of $8.50 per ton and approximately 100 tons of skeleton scrap at $7.50 and $6.50 per ton, loaded on a steamer (SS. Lina L.D.), which the defendants had chartered to load at the ports of Montreal, Quebec and Halifax for a voyage to Japan. Part of the purchased scrap had been accumulated on the French Cable Company\u2019s wharf at Dartmouth and part was in Halifax, and the contract stated that the defendants expected the steamer in Halifax about the middle of July. The written contract contained the following provision:\nRailway weights to govern settlement on all material loaded in Halifax. For material loaded in Dartmouth, weight to be obtained in accordance with ship\u2019s draft. You have the right to appoint Lloyds Agents to act on your behalf as regards to checking the draft for weight purposes, and we are appointing ship\u2019s chief officer for the same purpose.\nThe intention of the parties obviously was that the Lina L.D. should dock at the wharf, where the Dartmouth scrap was located, and the scrap loaded and stowed on the steamer directly from the wharf. The steamer arrived in Halifax harbour on July 22, but the intention of the parties that she should take on the Dartmouth cargo from the French Cable wharf was frustrated by reason of the fears of the captain that there was not a sufficient depth of water to enable her safely to do so. The result was that the parties entered into a new agreement regarding the Dartmouth scrap, and the steamer proceeded to Pier No. 3 on the Halifax side of the harbour, where she docked and next day began taking on the scrap, which had been brought there in railway cars. The Dartmouth scrap was loaded into lighters at the French Cable wharf, transported to the ship\u2019s side and loaded and stowed in the steamer from these lighters, while the Halifax scrap was being put on from the pier. A dispute arose between the parties as to the weight of the steel scrap which was brought from Dartmouth, the defendants claiming that it weighed only 464 tons, and the plaintiffs that it weighed 867 tons.\nThe plaintiffs consequently brought this action to recover the balance alleged to be due to them for goods sold and delivered under the written contract and for the cost and expenses of the transportation of the Dartmouth scrap to the steamer\u2019s side. The plaintiff Edward Whitz-man also claimed $495 in addition for supervising the loading of 1,980 tons of scrap iron at Halifax under a special agreement made with the defendants in June. The total amount claimed by the plaintiffs was $15,364.13, upon which they credited payments to the amount of $6,271.25, leaving a balance claimed of $9,092.88.\nThe action was tried at Halifax before Mr. Justice Hall and a jury. The jury, in answer to questions submitted by the learned Judge, found that the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs the cost of transferring the Dartmouth scrap from the Cable wharf to the ship\u2019s side; that the Lina L.D. could have loaded 920 tons at the Cable wharf in safety; and that 875 tons of scrap steel were delivered by lighters to the ship\u2019s side. The jury also found that the cause of the delay in loading the steamer was the transferring of the material in scows from Dartmouth to Halifax. The last mentioned finding bears only on the question of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim for demurrage. Upon these answers the learned trial Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiffs for $7,091.04, which was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court en banc by Sir Joseph Chis-holm, C.J., and Graham and Doull, JJ.; Ross, J., holding that the verdict should be reduced to $4,048.04. All four Appeal Justices held that the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants agreed to pay the cost of the transferring of the Dartmouth scrap to the steamer\u2019s side at the Halifax pier could not be set aside, though Ross, J., remarked that it was not very strongly supported.\nAs this finding is one which depends entirely upon the credibility of evidence, I think it must be taken as conclusive upon the question. The finding on the question of delay disposes of the claim for demurrage.\nThe substantial attack on the trial and appeal judgments centres entirely around the construction and application of the weight clause above quoted, and the evidence upon which the plaintiffs relied to prove the weight of the scrap which was delivered to the steamer in lighters from the French Cable wharf. All this evidence was objected to on the trial as an attempt to vary the terms of the written contract regarding the method of ascertaining the weight of this material, which method, the defendants contended, was still applicable notwithstanding the alleged new agreement for the loading at Halifax from the lighters. If this contention is sustained, the finding of the jury as to the weight of the Dartmouth scrap delivered cannot, of course, stand. If it is not sustained, the jury\u2019s finding is fully warranted by the evidence relied on.\nI concur entirely in the view of the majority of the Supreme Court en banc as expressed by Mr. Justice Graham, that the weighing clause did not in the circumstances apply to the Dartmouth scrap as loaded. The defendants having loaded their own scrap at Halifax at the same time that the loading of the Dartmouth scrap was proceeding under the new agreement, it became quite impossible to check the weight of the Dartmouth scrap by the displacement method within the true meaning of the weight clause. Such a thing as the simultaneous loading of the Halifax and Dartmouth material at Halifax was surely never contemplated by either party. The displacement method was prescribed for ascertaining the weight of the Dartmouth scrap separately, and obviously could not be used to determine the weight of a mixed shipment.\nI also fully agree with the view stated in the majority judgment on appeal that, even if it should be held that the weight clause was not affected by this complete change of conditions, as written in the original contract, it contemplated concurrent checking and raised a duty on the part of each to co-operate with the other in the checking of the steamer\u2019s draft. The checking contemplated was not a mere observation of the draft of the vessel as she lay in the water before and after the loading of the material. The clause says:\nYou have the right to appoint Lloyd\u2019s Agents to act on your behalf as regards to checking the draft for weight purposes, and we are appointing ship\u2019s chief officer for the same purpose.\nThe checking, as is clearly shewn on the record, involves the ascertaining of all fuel and ballast aboard immediately before loading commences and also immediately after its completion and the sounding for this purpose of all tanks, peaks, bilges, etc. The importance of an accurate checking as to all these points is evident from the fact, which was pointed out in the record, that every inch of additional draft in the water represented an addition of 44\u00bd tons of cargo. It is quite true that the plaintiffs did not themselves appoint anyone to act for them in the checking of the draft or request an opportunity of checking it for themselves, but they were never notified by the defendants or by the ship\u2019s officer that the draft was to be checked, as provided by the weight clause, for the purpose of ascertaining the weight of the Dartmouth material, and it seems to me in all the circumstances that it cannot fairly be held that the weight clause of the original contract was incorporated as an implied term of the wholly new arrangement which the jury found was entered into between the parties with respect to the loading of the Dartmouth scrap. This clause, in my opinion, is not applicable for the reasons stated, and it was therefore quite competent to the plaintiffs to prove by the best available testimony the weight of the material which they actually delivered to the defendant\u2019s chartered steamer. The evidence of the lightermen and others which they did adduce for this purpose, in my judgment fully warrants the finding which the jury made that at least 875 tons were supplied to the steamer from Dartmouth. For this the defendants should be required to pay.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L. A. Lovett.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. N. Wickwire.\n[1] [1936] 1 D.L.R. 780.\n",

Street Appellant;\nand\nBritish American Oil Co. Ltd. and Others Respondents,\n1936: June 17.\nPresent: Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nAppeal\u2014Practice\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Failure to obtain approval of security and allowance of appeal within the sixty days fixed by s. 64 of Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35)\u2014Secs. 64, 67, 70 of the Act\u2014 Appeal from Registrar\u2019s order refusing to approve security and affirm Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014Procedure\u2014Rules 1, 2, 8, 86, 87, 88 of Rules of Supreme Court of Canada.\nTo bring an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in compliance with s. 67 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), it is not sufficient to give notice of appeal and pay $500 into court as security within the 60 days fixed (except as otherwise provided) by s. 64; there must be also, within the said time limited, approval of the security and allowance of the appeal.\nAn order of the Registrar, on a motion made returnable after expiry of said period of 60 days, refusing, on above ground, to approve the security and affirm the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal, was affirmed by the Court.\nThe question arising out of the fact that the allowance of the appeal was not obtained within the said period of 60 days, was considered as raising the question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal (Ohene Moore v. Akesseh Tayee, [1935] A.C. 72); and hence the appeal from said order of the Registrar was dealt with, not as one governed by rules 86, 87 and 88 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, but as one governed by rule 3 thereof, which provides for an appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order to the Court, and fixes no delay within which the notice of appeal must be served.\nMOTION by the respondents for an order quashing an appeal from an order of the Registrar, as set out below. Also the appellant\u2019s appeal from said order of the Registrar was heard on its merits as set out below.\nThe appellant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, dated November 4, 1935[1], which held that the interest payable on certain bonds issued by the Moose Jaw Electric Ry. Co. should not be regarded, under certain provisions of The Saskatchewan Railway Act (R.S.S. 1930, c. 96), as \u201cworking expenses\u201d so as to entitle the claims of the bondholders for such interest to rank pro rata with the claims of certain creditors who were referred to as \u201c work creditors,\u201d on certain moneys in the hands of the National Trust Co. Ltd. as trustee.\nOn January 3, 1936 (the last day of the 60 days for bringing the appeal to this Court under s. 64 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), the appellant paid into court $500 as security for costs and gave a certain notice of motion, returnable on January 15, 1936, before the Registrar of this Court, for an order approving of the security tendered by the appellant and for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the appeal. The motion was adjourned from time to time and was heard by the Registrar on February 17, 1936. The Registrar refused the motion. He gave reasons as follows:\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is a motion, which was made returnable before me on 15th January, 1936, but adjourned from time to time, and finally brought on before me on 17th February, 1936, for an order approving of the security tendered by the appellant, and for an order affirming the jurisdiction. The motion was contested on the ground that the appeal was not brought within sixty days from the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from, and that there was no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal, inasmuch as the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal did not exceed $2,000. Mr. Justice Embury of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the Province of Saskatchewan, by his, judgment dated 26th March, 1935, held that interest on certain bonds secured by a mortgage covering the assets of the Moose Jaw Electric Railway Company was properly chargeable as working expenses, under the provision of the Saskatchewan Railway Act. The creditors appealed to the Court of Appeal for the Province of Saskatchewan, which Court, by a judgment dated November 4, 1935, reversed Mr. Justice Embury\u2019s judgment, holding that the interest on bonds should not be declared to be a working expense or working expenditure within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Railway Act.\nSection 64 of the Supreme Court Act provides:\u2014\nExcept as otherwise provided, every appeal shall be brought within sixty days from the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from, but the months of July and August shall be excluded in the computation of the said sixty days.\n3rd January, 1936, was thus the last day for bringing the appeal.\nSection 67 of the Supreme Court Act provides:\u2014\nNo writ shall be required or issued for bringing any appeal in any case to or into the Court, but it shall be sufficient that the party desiring so to appeal shall, within the time herein limited in the case [namely, sixty days], have given the security required and obtained the allowance of the appeal.\nSection 70 provides that no appeal shall be allowed until the appellant has given proper security, to the extent of $500, to the satisfaction of the court from whose judgment he is about to appeal, or a judge thereof, or to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court, or a judge thereof, that he will effectually prosecute his appeal, etc.\nOn the 3rd of January, 1936, the appellant paid into court $500 as security for costs and, the respondent\u2019s solicitors not having any Ottawa agents, posted up on a board in the Registrar\u2019s office a notice of motion, (a) for an order approving of the security tendered by the appellant, and (b) for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear the appellant\u2019s appeal, returnable on 15th January, and they also sent a copy of the notice of motion, dated 31st December, 1935, to the solicitors for the respondent at Moose Jaw, by registered mail, which was received by them on 8th January, 1936. In my opinion the statute requires the appellant to bring his appeal by serving a proper notice of appeal, giving the security required and obtaining the allowance of the appeal, within the sixty days. I think it is not sufficient that he should have paid the security into court, posted up a notice of appeal and notice of intention to apply for approval of the security (thus having the appeal allowed), returnable after the sixty days had expired. If the sixty days be too short a time to perfect the security, an application must be made under section 66 of the Act, to the court proposed to be appealed from or any judge thereof, based upon the special circumstances required by that section, to allow the appeal, although the same is not brought within the time prescribed in that behalf, namely, 60 days. The motion to approve the security must be refused, with costs.\nIn view of the foregoing conclusion, it may be unnecessary to deal with the question of jurisdiction, but, in case it is desired to appeal from my order, I may say that I am satisfied that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the proposed appeal exceeds the sum of $2,000.\nThe Registrar\u2019s order refusing appellant\u2019s said motion was made on the 17th day of February, 1936.\nOn the 21st day of May, 1936, the solicitors for the appellant gave notice that a motion would be made on behalf of the appellant to the Court on Tuesday, the 6th day of October, 1936, by way of appeal from the order of the Registrar and to reverse that part of the order disallowing the appeal, and for an order allowing the said appeal, upon the ground that the Registrar erred in deciding that the Supreme Court Act required the appellant to bring his appeal by a proper notice of appeal, giving the security required, and obtaining the allowance of the appeal, all within sixty days of the decision complained of.\nThereupon the agents of the solicitors for the respondents applied for an order quashing the appeal from the order of the Registrar, on the ground that the said appeal was not launched in time or with due diligence; or, in the alternative, for an order dismissing the said appeal; or, in the further alternative, in case the said appeal was allowed, for an order directing the appellant to proceed with his appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan dated the 4th day of November, 1935, at the sittings of this Court commencing on Tuesday, the 6th day of October, 1936.\nR. Quain K.C. for the appellant.\nR. S. Smart K.C. for the respondents.\nOn the hearing of the motion to quash it was urged on behalf of the respondents that the Registrar\u2019s order was made in pursuance of his jurisdiction under rules 82 et seq. of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, 1929, and accordingly that the notice of appeal therefrom should have been \u201cserved within four days after the decision complained of, * * * or served within such other time as may be allowed by a Judge of the said Court or the Registrar\u201d (rule 87); moreover, that the appeal lay to a Judge of the Court, not to the Full Court, and should have been brought on for hearing on the first Monday after the expiry of the delays provided for by rule 87, or so soon thereafter as the same could be heard (rule 88).\nOn the other hand, it was argued for the appellant that the question whether the appeal from the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan had been properly launched within the requirements of s. 67 of the Supreme Court Act involved the further question whether the Court was competent to hear it, and, therefore, was one of jurisdiction governed by rules 1 et seq. of the Court. Under rule 3, the appeal from an order of the Registrar, either affirming or refusing to affirm the jurisdiction of the Court, had to be made to the Court itself upon a notice of such appeal being served; and no delay was provided by the rules within which the party dissatisfied with the order of the Registrar had to serve notice of the motion to the Court.\nThe Court found that the appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order undoubtedly was not launched with due diligence, there having elapsed more than three months between the date of the order and that of the notice of appeal.\nBut, upon the authority of the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Ohene Moore v. Akesseh Tayee[2], the question arising out of the fact that the allowance of the appeal was not obtained within the sixty days might be considered as raising the question of the jurisdiction to hear the appeal in the premises.\nAs a result, the appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order would not be an appeal governed by rules 87 and 88 of this Court, but an appeal governed by rule 3, wherein no delay is fixed within which to serve the notice of appeal.\nThe Court, therefore, intimated that, without passing upon the respondents\u2019 motion to quash the appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order, it would hear the appellant immediately on the merits of the appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order, and, after the argument of counsel for the appellant, and without calling upon counsel for the respondents, the Court delivered the following judgment:\nRinfret J.\u2014We shall not require to hear you, Mr. Smart.\nSection 67 of the Supreme Court Act prescribes the minimum required for bringing an appeal, in any case, into this Court. The appellant, within the time limited by sec. 64 of the Act (viz., sixty days), must \u201chave given the security required and obtained the allowance of the appeal.\u201d\nIn this case, the security was given within the time limit, but it was not approved and the allowance of the appeal was not obtained; and, under the circumstances, the Registrar very properly, we think, refused to approve the security after the time was expired.\nThere is no hardship in the premises; for the appellant, if he could show special circumstances, could always have secured the allowance of the appeal, although it was not brought within the time prescribed in that behalf, by applying either to \u201cthe court proposed to be appealed from, or any judge thereof\u201d (sec. 66 of the Supreme Court Act).\nThe appeal from the order of the Registrar must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal from Registrar\u2019s order dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Quain & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Grayson & McTaggart.\n[1] [1935] 3 W.W.R. 419; [1936] 1 D.L.R. 226.\n[2] [1935] A.C. 72.\n",

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1936: March 10, 11, 12; 1936: June 17.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Validity\u2014Subject-matter\u2014Invention.\nIn order validly to support a patent, not only must the art or the improvement therein be new, useful, and not anticipated by prior knowledge or prior user by others within the meaning of the Patent Act, but also there must be invention; one does not hold a valid subject-matter of a patent unless he shews the exercise of inventive ingenuity. Generally speaking, the question whether or not in any particular case there has been invention is one of fact and degree, depending upon practical considerations to a larger extent than upon legal interpretation. (Riekmann v. Thierry, 14 R.P.C. 105, Burt Business Forms Ltd. v. Autographic Register Systems Ltd., [1933] Can. S.C.R. 230, at 237, 238, and other cases, cited).\nIn the present case, the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1935] Ex. C.R. 190, holding that the patent in question (for a domestic refrigerator insulated door, recessed on its inner face so as to provide a hollow food space therein with suitable shelving arrangements, and without materially adding to the exterior dimensions of the refrigerator) was invalid for lack of subject-matter, was affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding (in an action by plaintiff for infringement) that its patent in question was invalid for lack of subject-matter. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Rinfret J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nW. C. Chipman K.C. and H. K. Thompson for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014I concur with Mr, Justice Rinfret.\nThe improvement in question had, no doubt, some value in convenience and considerable value in respect of properties calculated to result in commercial success.\nEverybody who bears in mind the vast number of people who live in small apartments must recognize the importance of reducing the volume of space occupied by necessary household appliances. Useful augmentation of capacity with virtually no increase of cost and relatively very little increase in the exterior dimensions of refrigerators are matters by no means without importance. The change in the form of the interior by recessing the door provides an opportunity for a very convenient rearrangement of shelves, \u2014a convenience which would constitute a strong attraction, no doubt, to housekeepers and improve saleability. But it does not appear to me that what was done was so far from the track of probable development in refrigerator design as to amount to invention in the sense of the patent law. I cannot satisfy myself that the conception of recessing the door and thus providing increased capacity and an opportunity for a more convenient arrangement of shelving involved an apprehension of a desideratum, or a gain of great advantage by very simple means, of the kind which the courts have often recognized as affording satisfactory evidence of invention.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon and Kerwin J J. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014It is only necessary in this case to consider the question of subject-matter.\nThe patent in issue relates to improvements in refrigerating units and has to do particularly with cabinet construction in combination with a cooling apparatus of a mechanical refrigerating system for providing additional food space alleged to be maintained at a temperature different from the normal temperature in the main food compartment. In the specification, the object of the alleged invention was stated to consist in replacing\nthe standard door with the inwardly extending pan with a door wherein the thickness or insulating part thereof extends outwardly past the flange of the door and the inwardly extending or pan portion is annular in form so as to provide a hollow food space in line with or extending outwardly of the usual breaker strip.\nThe result of this construction is claimed to be\nthe provision of approximately an extra cubic foot of food space without changing the dimensions of the standard refrigerator box. * * * the slight bulge on the door will in no way change the space within the kitchen or other room within which the box is designed to fit, so that any standard refrigerator door can be replaced by the door embodying the present invention without any change in the position of the box.\nA feature specially referred to in the patent\nis the location of the food space at a point relative to the cooling unit whereby the temperatures maintained in this extra food space will be at a higher range than the temperature existing in the refrigerator proper.\nThe original patent (No. 334,900) issued on August 15th, 1933, and contained nine claims; but, on the ground that the patent was \u201cdeemed defective in that it failed to claim accurately and fully the invention disclosed\u201d and that the \u201cerror arose from inadvertence,\u201d the appellant, as assignee of the patentee, Mrs. Constance Lane West, of the city of Detroit, Michigan, petitioned for a reissue of the patent, which was granted on June 5th, 1934, under number 342,173.\nBy the grant, three new claims were added to the patent and, in addition to claim 9, the new claims are those now sued upon on the ground of their infringement by respondent.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court, where the trial was conducted, found that the improvement \u201cpossessed a new and useful feature * * * not to be found in any of the prior art cited\u201d; that \u201cthere was no prior user of it\u201d; that \u201cit is absolutely clear that the defendant\u2019s structure infringes the plaintiff\u2019s patent\u201d; but \u201cthat there is not subject-matter in the patent in suit.\nThe appellant contended before this Court that the trial judge had misdirected himself by taking an erroneous view of the meaning of the word \u201cinvention\u201d; and that is the only point which stands to be examined in this appeal; for if it be decided against the appellant\u2014as we think it ought to be\u2014it is immaterial to discuss the question raised by the respondent that the re-issue was invalid for the reason that it did not meet the essential requirements of the Patent Act.\nIn its factum, the appellant described the improvement as consisting in a special type of door for a domestic refrigerator, the characteristics of which were that the inside face of the door had all around its periphery a projecting flange, as it is called, which co-operates with the edge of the door aperture in the refrigerator box to prevent the leakage of heat around the door, and that, surrounded by this flange, there is in the door a shallow recess which may be equipped with shelves on which articles to be kept cool may be stored.\nMore than once, in the course of the trial, the respondent admitted that if there was invention in what was described in the patent, then the respondent infringed. For that reason, the appellant abstained from adducing any evidence on the issue of infringement; and, although the respondent attempted to raise that issue before us, we think it must be held to have been abandoned. On the other hand, while the specification rather emphasizes the importance of the slightly higher temperature in the hollow recess said to be provided by the bulging out of the door, counsel for the appellant clearly indicated at the trial that he was not pressing that particular claim. Indeed, he stated that it was \u201cnot of much importance as we find it is difficult to follow the exact course of the air in an experimental fashion, that is, to be of any great advantage,\u201d although theoretically he thought it was perfectly easy to explain.\nAs a consequence, the learned President did not consider that feature of the patent in his judgment; and he stated that there was\nbut one substantial point for decision here, and that is whether or not there was invention in the idea of recessing the inner face of an insulated door in a domestic refrigerator so as to provide a hollow food space therein with suitable shelving arrangements, and without materially adding to the exterior dimensions of the refrigerator.\nIn view of the course of the trial, we do not think it is open to the appellant to pretend that the issue between the parties was not so restricted. And we will proceed to discuss the case accordingly. May it be added, moreover, that, on the evidence, this branch of the patent could hardly be supported.\nIn the circumstances, counsel for the appellant naturally directed the greatest part of his argument to the question of what constituted invention within the meaning of the Canadian Patent Act; and he laid considerable stress on the contention that the true test was that of obviousness. He referred to a number of judgments in the English courts, where the word \u201cObvious\u201d was used to indicate the dividing line between an improvement held to be an invention in the patentable sense and an advance found to have been a mere workshop improvement and, therefore, not within the patentable class.\nNotwithstanding the very ingenious and exhaustive argument of counsel for the appellant, we would hardly think, however, he would ask this Court to give a sacro-sanct meaning to the use of the word \u201cobvious\u201d for the purpose of discriminating between the category of improvements which ought to be regarded as being properly inventions in the legal sense and the category of those not so regarded. We would suggest that, in England, the appearance, in later years, of the word \u201cobvious,\u201d in judgments dealing with patent matters, probably results from the fact that, under section 25 (subs, \u0192) of the English Patents and Designs Act, a patent may be revoked upon the ground \u201cthat the invention is obvious and does not involve any inventive step having regard to what was known or used prior to the date of the patent.\u201d But although, perhaps, judgments under Canadian patent law may not have denied patentability to certain improvements upon the express ground that the advance over the prior art should be taken to have been obvious to the persons skilled in the art, the jurisprudence, both in the Canadian courts and in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, is not wanting in pronouncements conveying the same idea. It has long been laid down in our courts that, in order validly to support a patent, it was, of course, necessary that the art, or the improvement thereon, should be new, that it must be useful and that it must not have been anticipated by prior knowledge or prior user by others within the meaning of sec. 7 of the Patent Act, in force at the time of the issuance of the patent in suit; but that something additional was also required. It was essential that there should be invention and that one did not hold a valid subject-matter of a patent unless he showed the exercise of the inventive faculties (See: Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vbis. Patents and Inventions, no. 288); and that is to say, in the words of Lord Watson (Thomson v. American Braided Wire Company[2]), \u201ca degree of ingenuity * * * which must have been the result of thought and experiment.\u201d\nIt would be idle to attempt a comprehensive definition. In certain cases, the decision must necessarily be the result of some nicety. It is a question of fact and degree (Riekman v. Thierry[3]), depending upon practical considerations to a larger extent than upon legal interpretation. Lord Moulton is quoted by Terrell on Patents (8th ed., p. 78) as stating that, generally speaking, it must be \u201ctreated as being a question of fact for the judgment of whatever tribunal has the duty of deciding.\u201d\nWe would refer to the judgments of this Court in: Durable Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd.[4]; Mailman v. Gillette[5]; Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Colonial Fastener Co. Ltd.[6]; and more particularly to Burt Business Forms Ltd. v. Autographic Register Systems Ltd.[7], where the necessity of inventive ingenuity is insisted upon, and reference is made to the leading case of Harwood v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[8], and to the law as laid down by Lord Halsbury in Morgan v. Windover[9]; by Romer, J., in Wood v. Raphael[10]; and again by the House of Lords in the case already referred to of Riekmann v. Thierry[11]\u2014where the Court was composed of Lord Halsbury, L.C., Lord Mac-naghten, Lord Shand and Lord Davey.\nIn this case, applying the principle laid down in the judgments referred to and having regard to the general common knowledge of the art, we find it impossible to apply the word \u201cinvention,\u201d in the patentable sense, to the improvement disclosed in the appellant\u2019s specification; and we agree with the trial judge that the patent is invalid for lack of subject-matter. To repeat the words of Lord Tomlin in Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Colonial Fastener Co. Ltd.[12], we do not think \u201cthe inventive element necesary to constitute subject-matter is made sufficiently evident.\u201d\nThere could be no possible invention in the idea of putting shelves on a door. There were already in existence any number of cabinets, such as medicine cabinets, kitchen cabinets, display cabinets, and the like, including cabinets of the refrigerator class, fitted for the storage of articles. Hollow doors with shelves or bulged out doors had already been designed. If a refrigerator manufacturer was not satisfied with his shelving arrangement, it would not require invention on his part to adopt the shelving arrangement of other article-storing cabinets. We fail to see an inventive step, in the sense indicated by the decided cases, in the fact of merely designing a recess door with shelves in the hollowing space, with the consequential result that the door will be bulged out. There was no problem in the idea, nor difficulty in the carrying out of it.\nOn the evidence, the trial judge expressed no surprise \u201cthat the West door did not earlier come into use.\u201d He found that mechanical refrigerators for domestic use were comparatively new articles and such structural alterations came at the time when they were likely to be expected. Before then, there was really no incentive to solve the problem, for the real demand had only recently come into existence. The modification suggested by Mrs. West undoubtedly met with some measure of success; but we do not think commercial success is an important factor in the present case, since the growing sales of the appellant\u2019s refrigerators were substantially in proportion with the total sales of mechanical refrigerators of all makes in the United States at the material periods of time.\nThe appellant adduced the evidence of a great number of salesmen and dealers to show the favour with which refrigerators equipped with the West door were received by them. But it is sufficient to make a perusal of that evidence to find that the features of saleability which they emphasize refer merely to the added space, or increased capacity, the easier access to the small articles stored, and the fact that the new name given to the article, \u201cShelvador,\u201d and the attractive ornamentation of the recess door had a distinct appeal to the housewives.\nImprovements of that character do not, as a rule, fall within the class of invention. As pointed out by the trial judge, it was perhaps not unnatural that the suggestion came from a woman acting for large furnishing establishments and experienced in the art of interior decoration. The refrigerator in existence long before the West patent at Caulfield\u2019s Dairy Limited, in Toronto, may not perhaps show anticipation in the pertinent sense, but it indicates that the idea of shelves in a recess door, such as we have in the patent in suit, is nothing more than a workshop improvement and did not involve the exercise of the inventive faculty essentially required for the grant of a monopoly.\nUnder the circumstances, we think the learned President was right in denying validity to the re-issued patent of the appellant, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavis J\u2014No doubt, if the patent is valid, the defendants have infringed. There is only one issue, subject-matter.\nThere was no constructional difficulty and the design does not appear to me to lie \u201cso much out of the track of the former use as not naturally to suggest itself to a person turning his mind to the subject,\u201d to use the words of Lord Chelmsford, in Penn v. Bibby[13]. Or, to put it in the words of Lord Shaw in London General Omnibus Company v. Bonnard[14], the design \u201cmight well have occurred to an intelligent person without any exercise of that invention which is necessary as the ground of a patent.\u201d\nThere is nothing of substance in the alleged difference of air currents and temperatures within the door as distinct from those in the body of the refrigerator proper. In his opening at the trial, counsel for the appellant, when asked by the trial judge whether the direction of the flow of air had anything to do with the case, said:\nIt may come into it but it is not of much importance as we find it is difficult to follow the exact course of the air in an experimental fashion, that is, to be of any great advantage, but theoretically it is perfectly easy to explain.\nAnd during the trial counsel for the appellant said:\nIt is very difficult to determine with sufficient scientific accuracy to be useful exactly what the courses of currents in the refrigerator are.\nI cannot find in this patent anything more than a design of domestic utility and of commercial advantage. There is not in it that \u201ccharacteristic or quality the presence of which distinguishes invention from a workshop improvement,\u201d to adopt the language of Lord Tomlin (then Tomlin J.) in Parkes v. Cocker[15].\nI therefore concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacFarlane, Thompson & Littlejohn.\n[1] [1935] Ex.

Judgment appealed from (8 M.P.R. 482) aff.\nPer Duff, Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.\u2014Although the provisions of section 88 of the Bank Act are provisions which strictly relate to Banking and are therefore within the competency of the Dominion Parliament under section 91 (15) of the B.N.A. Act, the Parliament, in enacting them, did not intend to remove any property, which might foe assigned to a bank by way of security thereunder, from the operation of any statute by the legislature of the province, in which the property is situated, in the legitimate exercise of its power in relation to direct taxation for provincial purposes under section 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act.\u2014The assessment authorized by section 57 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is a direct tax upon the employers in each of the specified classes of industry, imposed for provincial purposes within the meaning of section 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act. Cannon J. expressing no opinion as to whether or not such assessment is an indirect tax.\nPer Davis J.\u2014On the particular facts of this case, if the assessment and levy of these workmen\u2019s compensation dues is taxation, it is direct taxation within the province and competent to the provincial legislature.\u2014The securities under section 88 of the Bank Act do not operate to transfer absolutely the ownership in the goods, but such transaction is essentially a mortgage transaction and subject to the general law of mortgages except where the statute has otherwise expressly provided. Bank of Montreal v. Guaranty Silk Dyeing and Finishing Co. Ltd.

B. Smith K.C. for the appellant,\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nL. A. Lovett K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco on a special case stated by the parties for the opinion of the Court as to whether the respondent had the right to levy on a quantity of hardwood flooring and lumber in the possession of Annapolis Hardwood Company, Limited, in priority to a security held by the appellant thereon under s. 88 of the Bank Act, ch. 12, R.S.C., 1927.\nThe bank\u2019s security consists of an assignment, which it obtained from the Hardwood Co. on March 30, 1931. It strictly follows the form of schedule C of the Bank Act and purports to assign to the bank all the products of the forest and goods, wares and merchandise then owned and in the possession of the company, in consideration of an advance of $5,327 as security for the payment of a series of demand notes specified in a schedule annexed thereto aggregating the amount of the stated advance. The goods are described as \u201call the lumber and products thereof and special dimension hardwood,\u201d situated at five different places in Nova Scotia and at the company\u2019s mill and millyard and wharf at Annapolis Royal, and are stated to be \u201cfree from any mortgage, lien or charge thereon (except previous assignments to the bank).\u201d\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, having received notice from the Hardwood Co. on March 15, 1931, that it had entered into a logging contract with one A. S. Bent, thereafter, on April 11, 1931, assessed Bent and the company under s. 77 (1) and other relevant sections of the Nova Scotia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in the sum of $90 in respect of Bent\u2019s payroll for the year 1931, and later made two further assessments against them for additional sums in respect of Bent\u2019s payroll for the year 1930 as well as for the year 1931. On October 9, 1931, the Board recovered a judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Bent for $197.53, the amount of the assessments then outstanding against him, and $4.53 for costs, and issued execution thereon directing the sheriff to levy the sum of $206.95. Nothing presumably having been realized from the execution against Bent the Board later, on March 3, 1932, recovered another judgment against the Hardwood Co. for $243.89, the amount of the outstanding assessments against Bent and the company in respect of Bent\u2019s payrolls for the years 1930 and 1931 together with penalties and the further sum of $4.55 for costs. Execution was forthwith issued upon this judgment and on March 4, 1932, the sheriff of Annapolis levied on all the hardwood flooring in the company\u2019s mill and on all the lumber in its yard at Annapolis Royal. This levy was withdrawn on the undertaking of the bank to pay the amount due under the execution if the court should determine that the Board had the right to levy on the said flooring and lumber in priority to the bank\u2019s claim.\nThe special case after setting forth the facts, the essential features of which I have attempted to summarize, states:\nBy section 79 (2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act the amount of the assessments above referred to and of the cost, if incurred, of recording a certified copy of such assessment in the registry of deeds and any judgment with respect to same, is declared to be a first lien on all the property, real, personal or mixed, used in or in connection with or produced in or by the industry, with respect to which the employer is assessed, though not owned by the employer, subject only to municipal taxes;\nand that the Board under s. 79 (2) and other relevant sections of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act claims a lien in priority to the claims of the bank on the property levied upon on the ground that the said property had been\nproduced in or by the industry with respect to which the employer was assessed, though not owned by the employer, subject only to municipal taxes.\nThe questions submitted to the court were as follows:\u2014\nFirst: On the facts as hereinbefore stated \u201edoes the claim of the said Board to the property levied upon take priority to the claim of the said bank? Second: If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, is the claim of the said Board limited to so much of the property levied upon as was actually produced by the operations of said Bent in respect of which the said assessments were made or does it extend to all property produced in or by the industry of lumbering and the manufacture of lumber and all work incidental thereto as carried on by the said Annapolis Hardwood Company, Limited?\nThe majority of the court, Graham, Ross and Hall JJ. answered the first question in the affirmative and held in answer to the second question that the claim of the Board extended to all the goods produced in or by the industry with respect to which the company, the employer, was assessed. Mellish and Carroll JJ. held that the first question should be answered in the negative.\nWhile we have no doubt that the provisions of s. 88 the Bank Act are provisions which strictly relate to banking, and are therefore within the competency of the Dominion Parliament under s. 91 (15) B.N.A. Act, we are of opinion that in enacting them Parliament did not intend to remove any property, which might be assigned to a bank by way of security thereunder, from the operation of any statute enacted by the legislature of the province, in which the property is situated, in the legitimate exercise of its power in relation to direct taxation for provincial purposes under s. 92 (2) B.N.A. Act.\nIn Canadian Pacific Railway v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[2], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council considered an appeal from a decree of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec, which condemned the appellant company to pay a fine of $200 for failure to clean and put in good order a ditch along the right of way of the company. The railway, as all railways extending beyond the limits of the province, came within exception (a) of 92 (10) B.N.A. Act regarding local works and undertakings and consequently under enumerated head 29 of s. 91 B.N.A. Act, and it was contended by counsel for the appellant that no provincial legislature was competent to enforce the performance of any Act affecting the physical condition of the railway. The Board held that by the true construction of the B.N.A. Act, s. 91, ss. (29) and s. 92, ss. (10), the Dominion Parliament had the exclusive right to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair and alteration of the appellant railway, and that the provincial legislature had no power to regulate the structure of a ditch forming part of its authorized works, but that the provisions of the Municipal Code of Quebec, which prescribed the cleaning of the ditch and the removal of an obstruction which had caused inundation on neighbouring land were intra vires of the provincial legislature. In delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Watson said:\nThe British North America Act, whilst it gives the legislative control of the appellants\u2019 railway qua railway to the Parliament of the Dominion, does not declare that the railway shall cease to be part of the provinces in which it is situated, or that it shall, in other respects, be exempted from the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. Accordingly, the Parliament of Canada has, in the opinion of their Lordships, exclusive right to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair, and alteration of the railway, and for its management, and to dictate the constitution and powers of the company; but it is, inter alia, reserved to the provincial parliament to impose direct taxation upon those portions of it which are within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nIt is admitted by the appellant that the assessment authorized by s. 57 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, ch. 129, R.S. of Nova Scotia, is a tax and we have no doubt that it is a direct tax upon the employers in each of the specified classes of industry, imposed for provincial purposes within the meaning of 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act. S. 79 (2) of the provincial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides that\nThe amount of any assessment and of the cost, if incurred, of recording certified copy of such assessment in the registry of deeds, and any judgment with respect to same shall be a first lien upon all the property real, personal or mixed, used in or in connection with or produced in or by the industry with respect to which the employer is assessed, though not owned by the employer, subject only to municipal taxes, and the amount levied under execution upon any such judgment to the extent of the amount due upon such execution shall forthwith be paid by the sheriff or his deputy to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nWe think that this section\u201479 (2)\u2014must be regarded as an enactment properly made in relation to the direct taxation authorized by s. 57 of the provincial Act under the second enumerated head of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nSection 88 of the Bank Act itself creates no lien, though it provides that a bank may lend money to dealers in certain products upon the security of such products in a form set forth in schedule (c), and that by virtue of such security the bank shall acquire the same rights and powers in respect of such products as if it had acquired the same by virtue of a warehouse receipt. No lien results except by agreement between the bank and its customer. Section 79 (2) of the provincial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act itself directly creates a lien for a public tax or charge. There is, therefore, no conflict between the federal and provincial statutes on the face of the enactments themselves, and no conflict in their operation, as disclosed in this case, unless it be that s. 88 of the Bank Act contemplates that no property assigned to a bank under its provisions shall be subject to provincial taxation under 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act. We think that such is not the intendment of the federal enactment and that the provincial enactment must therefore prevail.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014The question of the validity of the tax sought to be collected by priority over the appellant\u2019s lien was first raised before this Court. The stated case only questioned the respective rank to be given to these two claims. Confining myself strictly to that feature of the case, I would answer both questions in the affirmative and agree to the dismissal of the appeal. I do not wish to commit myself nor decide in the premises whether or not, by the cumulative effect of sections 57, 77 (1) and 79 (2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Nova Scotia it might be found that the levy or tax is an indirect one and therefore ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nDavis J.\u2014This appeal raises a difficult question of law upon a contest between the appellant bank and the respondent Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board as to priority of their respective claims upon the lumber and products thereof of a lumbering company. The real question is whether or not the bank\u2019s security, prior as to time, taken under section 88 of the Bank Act (Dominion legislation), can maintain its priority in the face of the statutory lien that subsequently arose (by provincial legislation) in favour of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and declared to be \u201ca first lien upon\u201d the property. Counsel admitted that the company was insolvent and unable to pay both claims in full. The facts were not in dispute and the parties agreed to refer the question upon a stated case to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, pursuant to the provisions of Order XXXIII of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The majority of that Court (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) decided in favour of the claim to priority of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and from their decision the court gave leave to the bank to appeal to this Court.\nThe competency of the Dominion Parliament to pass section 88 of the Bank Act is not questioned. Nor is the competency of the provincial legislature to pass the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act questioned except in so far as the Act may have the effect of impairing the bank\u2019s security. It becomes necessary therefore to consider carefully the exact meaning and effect of the legislation involved in the point raised.\nDealing firstly with the position of the bank. It acquired its security (the validity of the security is in no way questioned) on March 30, 1931, under the provisions of section 88 of the Bank Act. That was prior in date to the first of the several assessments made by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. What was the nature, then, of the security that the bank acquired? The relevant sections of the Bank Act are sections 88 (1), 88 (7), 86 (1) and 86 (2a). Briefly stated, for they are very familiar sections, they provide that a manufacturer may give security to the bank on his goods, wares and merchandise to secure the repayment of moneys loaned by the bank and \u201call the right and title\u201d to such goods, wares and merchandise \u201cvest\u201d in the bank from the date of the acquisition thereof, subject to a proviso whereby unpaid wages for three months and unpaid purchase money under certain circumstances are made a prior charge. The legal estate passes to the bank. There is however a penalty against the bank selling until default and there is an express right to the customer, on repayment of the moneys loaned, to regain the title to the goods. This type of security is peculiar, so far as I know, to our Bank Act and it may be that in view of the civil law of the province of Quebec, the draftsman of the Act refrained from setting up the English form of mortgage involving the equitable doctrines (unknown to the Quebec civil law) of redemption and foreclosure. In Quebec, the hypothecary system of the Roman law prevails. The mortgagor merely hypothecates or charges the land in favour of the mortgagee, in effect acknowledging the indebtedness as a personal obligation, but retaining the title in himself; on default, the mortgagee may recover judgment on the obligation and bring the property to sale at the hands of the sheriff and is entitled to be paid the amount of the hypothec as a preferred claim out of the proceeds of the sale.\nI had occasion in Bank of Montreal v. Guaranty Silk Dyeing and Finishing Co. Ltd.[3] to consider this particular form of security and came to the conclusion, contrary to the very able argument of counsel for the bank in that case, that the security did not operate to transfer absolutely the ownership in the goods but that the transaction was essentially a mortgage transaction and subject to the general law of mortgages except where the statute has otherwise expressly provided. No appeal on this branch of that case was taken. Section 88 set up by the Bank Act enables manufacturers, who desire to obtain large loans from their bankers in order to carry on their industrial activities, to give to the bank a special and convenient form of security for the bank\u2019s protection in the large banking transactions necessary in the carrying on of industry throughout the country. Until the moneys are repaid, the bank is the legal owner of the goods but sale before default is prohibited and provision is made for the manufacturer regaining title upon repayment. To say that Parliament did not use language to expressly provide that the bank shall have a first lien on the goods is beside the mark. The bank acquires ownership in the goods by the statute. In the case with which we have to deal, the bank acquired ownership in the goods before any of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board\u2019s assessments were levied and the bank continued throughout all material times to hold such ownership. The nice question of law is whether or not the provincial legislature has the power, assuming the language of the provincial statute is clear enough to have that effect, to undermine the bank\u2019s security by creating a first lien upon the goods in question in favour of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. The conflicting views as presented to us may be summarized as follows:\nThe bank contends that having taken this security, the legal estate vested in it and being competent to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, a province has no right to legislate to cut down the security so acquired by creating liens upon it in favour of a provincial institution. The Board, on the other hand, contends that banks when they come into a province to do business must submit to local provincial laws of a general character affecting all industries alike and that the bank cannot be regarded as exempt from provincial enactments of a general nature. The bank supports its contention upon the principle, well established, that if there is a conflict in the operation of Dominion and provincial legislation the Dominion legislation must prevail. Reliance is put upon the judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[4], where the proposition laid down in Grand Trunk Railway v. Attorney-General for Canada[5] was restated in the following language:\nThere can be a domain in which provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which case neither legislation will be ultra vires if the field is clear, but if the field is not clear and the two legislations meet the Dominion legislation must prevail.\nThe Board, on the other hand, relies upon the language in the John Deere Plow case[6], where it was said\nIt is enough for present purposes to say that the province cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers. This does not mean that these powers can be exercised in contravention of the laws of the province restricting the rights of the public in the province generally. What it does mean is that the status and powers of a Dominion company as such cannot be destroyed by provincial legislation.\nand upon the language in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[7],\nThey (their Lordships) cannot see how the power of making banks contribute to the public objects of the provinces where they carry on business can interfere at all with the power of making laws on the subject of banking or with the power of incorporating banks.\nThe question is a difficult one but upon the best consideration that I have been able to give to it I have reached the conclusion that the goods in question, though owned by the bank subject to all the statutory rights and duties attached to the security, were property in the province of Nova Scotia\nused in or in connection with or produced in or by the industry with respect to which the employer (was) assessed though not owned by the employer\nand became subject to the lien of the provincial statute the same as the goods of other owners become liable to the burden of Workmen\u2019s Compensation assessments when the industry in which the goods are used or produced falls within the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It is a provincial measure of general application for the benefit of workmen employed in industry in the province and is not aimed at any impairment of bank securities though its operations may incidentally in certain cases have that effect. In my opinion this is not a case where there is any conflict of legislative authority. If it is possible to do so the different enactments should be construed and applied so as to give an adequate and proper place and function to each of them. When banks in this country take, as is well known they so often do, section 88 security on all the raw materials and goods in process of manufacture of a customer, and thereby accept a qualified ownership in the property used in or produced by the industry of its customer, they cannot expect to hold such property free and clear of those burdens on the industry that are of general application throughout the particular province in which the bank is doing business. Provision for compensation to workmen injured or contracting an industrial disease while engaged in industry has become a well understood public object of the provinces throughout Canada and the fact that a Dominion corporation holds the ownership in the property used or produced by an industry subjected to Workmen\u2019s Compensation legislation in the province cannot deprive the province of the right to impose contributions on the industry and to secure the payment of the assessments by a lien on the property used in or produced by the industry.\nThe word \u201cindustry\u201d in sec. 79 (2) is not an apt word but it is plain from a reading of the whole statute that it is not used in the subsection with which we are concerned in the sense of an industry taken as a whole, i.e., the lumbering industry throughout the province, but in a limited sense applying to the main but particular business in connection with the operations of which the workmen are employed either directly or indirectly, for example, workmen engaged in any operations of the Annapolis Lumber Company, Limited, whether employed directly by the company or indirectly by independent contractors, such as Bent, who carry on certain operations necessarily incidental in the manufacture of the products of the company. The employer is clearly the person in respect of whose payrolls the assessment is made.\nThe court raised the questions whether these Workmen\u2019s Compensation assessments were not taxation and if so were they indirect taxation so far as the facts of this case are concerned? Counsel for the appellant stated that he did not think these questions were really open to him upon the stated case. In any event both counsel indicated that they did not desire this aspect of the matter to be raised, preferring a determination of the issue as to priority on the assumption that the legislation was valid except in so far as it might undermine the bank\u2019s security. Assuming, without so deciding, that the imposition of assessments under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for the creation of a general fund available for distribution throughout the province among workmen who suffer accidents in the course of their employment, is taxation, it is inappropriate that we should dispose of the matter on any hypothetical basis that it is direct taxation, as suggested by counsel, because if the lien created by the provincial legislature to secure payment of the assessments involved in this case was beyond the competence of the provincial legislature as indirect taxation, then the bank\u2019s security is not affected by the invalid lien set up against it by the provincial Board. Whether taxation is direct or indirect must be determined in each case upon the particular facts of the case. What the Nova Scotia Act attempts to do in this case, and what is more or less the general scheme of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts in the different provinces, is that the business, as such, is really looked to for payment of the assessment. Take, for instance, the large pulp and paper companies in this country. Many of them, as is well known, carry on their woods operations by aid of independent contractors who undertake the cutting and delivery of wood in different sections of the company\u2019s limits. Then the subsequent logging operations in getting the wood down to the mills by water is frequently undertaken by independent logging contractors. Hundreds of men are thus engaged in the woods and in logging operations on the rivers and streams who are virtually part and parcel of the business of the company, although strictly they are not employees of the company but of these independent contractors. Now the general scheme of workmen\u2019s compensation legislation, and in particular of the Nova Scotia Act with which we are concerned, is to make an assessment in respect of all these workmen and for convenience a woods operator on his return of his employees and a logging contractor on his return of his employees, are charged the appropriate amount for the creation and maintenance of the general fund available for accidents throughout the province. The company itself is in effect required to hold back from the payments that fall due from time to time to these independent contractors the amounts of the assessments from time to time made against them respectively by the Board but if for any reason that is not done then the company itself must pay these assessments. It is a system of collection and recovery of the assessments. The point is that the business of a particular company is regarded as liable for all workmen\u2019s compensation assessments whether imposed in respect of those workmen who may strictly be said to be its own employees or with respect to those workmen who are strictly employees of independent contractors but are virtually engaged in the essential operations of the particular company. I cannot regard that as indirect taxation, something incompetent to the legislature as outside the proper meaning to be attributed to the words, \u201cdirect taxation within the province.\u201d There are cases where upon their special facts the definition of John Stuart Mill as to the distinction between direct and indirect taxation is sufficient to determine the matter. But as a matter of law that statement of economic theory is not to be exclusively and rigidly applied in determining, upon every given state of facts, whether the tax is or is not a direct tax. Lord Hobhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[8], said at p. 581:\nFirst, is the tax a direct tax? For the argument of this question the opinions of a great many writers on political economy have been cited, and it is quite proper, or rather necessary, to have careful regard to such opinions, as has been said in previous cases before this Board. But it must not be forgotten that the question is a legal one, viz., what the words mean, as used in this statute; whereas the economists are always seeking to trace the effect of taxation throughout the community, and are apt to use the words \u201cdirect,\u201d and \u201cindirect,\u201d according as they find that the burden of a tax abides more or less with the person who first pays it. This distinction is illustrated very clearly by the quotations from a very able and clear thinker, the late Mr. Fawcett, who, after giving his tests of direct and indirect taxation, makes remarks to the effect that a tax may be made direct or indirect by the position of the taxpayers or by private bargains about its payment. Doubtless, such remarks have their value in an economical discussion. Probably it is true of every indirect tax that some persons are both the first and the final payers of it; and of every direct tax that it affects persons other than the first payers, and the excellence of an economist\u2019s definition will be measured by the accuracy with which it contemplates and embraces every incident of the thing defined. But that very excellence impairs its value for the purposes of the lawyer. The legislature cannot possibly have meant to give a power of taxation valid or invalid according to its actual results in particular cases. It must have contemplated some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies.\nIn In re A reference under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and Section S of the Finance Act (Northern Ireland, 1934)[9], Lord Thankerton, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said that in the opinion of their Lordships,\nit is the essential character of the particular tax charged that is to be regarded, and the nature of the machinery\u2014often complicated\u2014by which the tax is to be assessed is not of assistance except in so far as it may throw light on the general character of the tax.\nIf the assessment and levy of these workmen\u2019s compensation dues is taxation, I am of the opinion that on the particular facts which are before us in this case, it is direct taxation within the province and competent to the provincial legislature.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

(Imp.) 6 Edw. VII, c. 41, s. 71.\nThe appellant company is a grain dealer and, in the course of its business, shipped grain cargoes from certain ports on the Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence river to Montreal. The respondent insurance company, by a \u201clake cargo policy,\u201d insured on account of the appellant all shipments of grain on vessels sailing between named dates against the risk of \u201closs or damage from any external cause\u201d occurring during the transportation of these cargoes. Under the terms of this floating policy, a valued marine certificate was issued on a cargo of no. 3 northern wheat valued at 65 cents per bushel. The grain was shipped at Fort William on board the \u201cAnna C. Minch,\u201d and, after being transhipped at Kingston to a barge, was tendered to the Harbour Commissioners elevator at Montreal. After a small quantity had been taken out, the wheat was refused by the elevator authorities, as it was found that it had become \u201ctough\u201d due to excessive moisture and had therefore lost its classification as no. 3 northern wheat. The appellant company directed the Montreal Harbour Commission to turn and dry the grain, a process of reconditioning; and, as a result of the process, nearly all the wheat came back to a moisture content which permitted it to be again classified as no. 3 northern. As provided in the policy, the consignees or holders of the certificates of insurance gave immediate notice of the loss or damage to G.W.P. Ltd. who then reported to the underwriters, the respondent, for adjustments or settlement; and Hays S. & Co. were subsequently called in as cargo surveyors to act on behalf of the respondent. Later, the general manager of the appellants insurance-brokerage firm, one Oldfin, suggested that bids be obtained for the wheat, and, as found by the trial judge and the majority of this Court, this was agreed to by the president of Hayes S. & Co. As a result of this arrangement, a grain broker, authorized by Oldfin, secured offers for the grain, amongst which was one from the appellant. At a meeting of all parties interested, it was agreed that the appellant\u2019s offer of the sum of $44,352.84 should be accepted. Later on, the reconditioned wheat was resold by the appellant company on a favourable market, the actual loss to the latter being $4,448.158, as contended by the respondent. The insured value of the cargo was $63,852.84. The appellant\u2019s action for \u201closs or damage\u201d to the wheat cargo under the insurance policy was maintained in full by the trial judge, the amount of $18,500 claimed and awarded being the difference between the insured value of the cargo and the amount of the sale of the reconditioned wheat to the appellant. The appellate court found the loss under the policy to be $4,448.58, representing the cost of turning and drying the wheat, warehouse storage charges and loss of bushels of grain that were not retained and dried.\nHeld, Davis J. dissenting in part, that the amount of the damage suffered by the appellant and for which the respondent is liable under the terms of the policy is $8,544.79; Cannon J. concurring with the judgment of the trial judge and Davis J. with that of the appellate court.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The amount of the damage suffered by the appellant is the sum of $18,500 as found by the trial judge; but this is not the amount for which the respondent is liable under the terms of the policy and certificate. The loss to the appellant is a partial loss; and the agreement between the parties as to the sale of the reconditioned wheat did not purport to alter the rule of law in such a case as contained in art. 2535 C.C., the provisions of which are similar to those contained in sec. 71 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1906, (Imp.) c. 41. In accordance with these provisions, the amount for which the respondent is liable is ascertained as follows: the insured value of the cargo was $63,852.84; the gross produce of the damaged sales was $44,352.84; the sound value of the grain on the first day of unloading at Montreal was 52\u215b cents per bushel; the total sound value of the cargo is therefore $51,205.08; the difference between the sound and damaged values is $6,852.24, which is 13.382 per cent of the sound value; and the percentage of the insured value of the total quantity of wheat delivered at Montreal, i.e., $63,852.84, amounts to $8,544.79, which is the loss for which the respondent is liable. Cannon J. contra.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The \u201csue and labour\u201d clause contained in the policy, which would have applied otherwise, cannot be invoked by the respondent in view of the agreement arrived at between the representatives of the parties in this case.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014Under the terms and ambit of the policy and according to the written documents of record, the findings of the trial judge should not be disturbed; and the latter held that the damage was ascertained by agreement of all interested parties for the purpose of any future litigation and that the amount so determined should be considered as the damage recoverable under the policy. The loss in this case was not, strictly speaking, a partial nor a total loss of the cargo, but rather a deterioration of the whole cargo causing damage for only part of the sum insured; and the eourse adopted by the parties, the conduct of the case and the proven circumstances make inapplicable the percentage rule of art. 2535 C.C. in order to reduce the sound value of the wheat: the necessary elements are lacking to establish the proportion contemplated by the Code. The \u201csue and labour\u201d clause would apply only in case of disaster during the voyage or adventure and not after the arrival of the ship at destination.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting in part)\u2014The \u201csue and labour\u201d clause should be applied in this case in order to determine the amount of the \u201closs or damage\u201d suffered by the appellant company; and, consequently the amount which the appellant is entitled to recover is the actual loss suffered by it amounting to $4,448.58, as held by the unanimous judgment of the appellate court. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, modifying the judgment of the Superior Court, Loranger J., and reducing the amount of recovery in an action on a marine policy.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and Russell McKenzie K.C. for the appellant.\nLucien Beauregard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The respondent insurance company, by lake cargo policy no. 120137, insured on account of the appellant all shipments of grain to be made by the appellant on vessels sailing between named dates, against the risk of \u201closs or damage from any external cause\u201d arising between certain ports on the Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence river. Under the terms of this floating policy a valued marine certificate was issued on a cargo of no. 3 northern wheat valued at 65 cents per bushel.\nThe grain was shipped on board the Anna C. Minch at the head of the Lakes and after being transhipped at Kingston was tendered to an elevator at Montreal. After a small quantity had been taken into the elevator, it was found that the wheat had become \u201ctough\u201d due to excessive moisture and had therefore lost its classification as no. 3 northern wheat. The appellant (plaintiff) alleged in its declaration that the wheat had been damaged by rain or some other external cause within the meaning of the policy and\nduring the transhipment of the said wheat at Kingston it rained causing the said wheat to become damp and tough.\nThese claims were denied by the respondent.\nAt the trial considerable evidence was heard as to the rainfall at Kingston when the grain was being transferred to the barge Redhead but it also appeared that the barge had been involved in an accident causing her to leak, although it was denied that this leak caused any damage to the grain. Certificates were produced which had been issued under the provisions of The Canada Grain Act, R.S.C. (1927), c. 86, and which stated that the grain shipped from the head of the Lakes was no. 3 northern. By virtue of section 27 of that Act these certificates were prima facie evidence of that fact. The appellant also led evidence by officials who had inspected and tested the grain which confirmed the grade stated in the certificates. The efforts of the respondent on this point were directed to showing that the wheat must have been tough when it started on its voyage, and that it was impossible for a sufficient quantity of rain to have damaged the grain in order to account for the difference in moisture contents at the head of the Lakes and at Montreal. On that branch of the case the learned trial judge found that the wheat when loaded was no. 3 northern and that it had been damaged while in transit through \u201can external cause.\u201d The Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) agreed with that finding and a careful examination of the evidence leads me to the same conclusion. The respondent\u2019s cross-appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAt the trial the appellant was successful in obtaining judgment for the full amount of the damages claimed by it, but the Court of King\u2019s Bench reduced this amount considerably for reasons shortly to be explained.\nThe certificate of insurance provided that, in case of loss or damage, the consignees or holders of the certificates should give immediate notice to G. W. Price Limited of Montreal \u201cwho will report to the underwriters for adjustments and\/or settlement.\u201d This was done and Hayes, Stuart & Company Limited were called in as cargo surveyors to act on behalf of the respondent underwriters. Captain Hayes, the president of Hayes, Stuart & Company Limited, called as a witness for the respondent, testified that he was notified by Mr. Barclay of the Price Company that the barge Redhead had some damaged cargo. This was on September 3rd, 1931, and from the information he then had, Captain Hayes understood that only a small quantity of grain, which he saw and which he estimated at 125 bushels, was in question. On September 8 or 9, he learned that a claim was being made by the appellant that all the grain had been damaged. He took the position that the loss could not have been caused by any external cause, and that therefore, his principal, the respondent in this appeal, could not beliable.\nThe appellant\u2019s insurance broker was Commercial Insurance Agency Limited and its general manager, L. J. Oldfin, suggested that bids be obtained for the wheat and the trial judge found that this was agreed to by Captain Hayes. It is true that in giving evidence, Captain Hayes did say, when being examined by counsel for the respondent:\nThis cargo was in the hands of James Richardson, the consignee: the cargo as far as I was concerned never left their possession. They were the owners of the cargo. Mr. Oldfin then, in course of time, telephoned that we should call for bids in order to find out what the market value of this grain was. They owned the cargo, they have a perfect right to call for bids for their own property.\nHowever, the next question and answer are important as showing that the position he adopted in the witness box was not the same as that which he indicated to Mr. Oldfin at the time in question.\nQ. What did you say to that?\nA. As far as I was concerned and the underwriters I was quite agreeable, without prejudice to the underwriters\u2019 interest, and Mr. Oldfin calling for bids.\nAs a result of this arrangement, Mr. Oldfin authorized a grain broker, Joseph A. Byrne, to endeavour to secure offers for the wheat. After Mr. Byrne had secured offers, among which was one from the appellant, a meeting took place between Oldfin, Bryne and Eric Crocker, an officer or employee of Hayes, Stuart & Company Limited. Mr. Crocker attended as Captain Hayes was not available at the time. At that meeting it was agreed that the appellant\u2019s offer should be accepted, and this is borne out by two letters of September 29th, 1931, written by Mr. Oldfin to Hayes, Stuart & Company Limited, and the respondent respectively. These letters are important and are as follows:\nEXHIBIT P. 8\nAttention Mr. Crocker. Sept. 29, 1931.\nMessrs. Hayes, Stuart & Co. Limited,\nMarine Surveyors,\n410 St. Nicholas street,\nMontreal.\nGentlemen:\u2014 Re Barge Read Head\nEx Anna C. Minch\nWe confirm conversation of yesterday in our office with Mr. Joseph Byrne, grain broker, and yourself, regarding the disposition of 98,099 bus. Tf. no. 3 northern Manitoba wheat unloaded at Montreal. As authorized by you, we notified Messrs. James Richardson & Sons Limited, Winnipeg, that their bid was accepted for account of whom it may concern, without prejudice, on the basis of 46\u00bc cents per bushel C.I.F. Montreal, as this was the highest tender received by Mr. Byrne. Two other bids were received, one from Messrs. Turgeon Ltd. at 45 cents with a contingent warranty that he would only take delivery of 5,000 or 10,000 bushel lots at the rate of 20,000 bus. weekly; and one other bid from Toronto Elevators Limited, Toronto, which we understand was equal to about 42\u00bd cents per bushel.\nYou will no doubt recall from Mr. Byrne\u2019s conversation, that it was with extreme difficulty that he was able to get any bids whatsoever on this wheat. Exporters stated that no demand was available for this grade of wheat, and from a domestic consumption viewpoint it would have to be carried for some time before it could be finally disposed of, and the carrying charges would probably amount to considerable. We are of the opinion that the tender put forward by Messrs. Richardson & Sons Limited is a very generous one.\nYours very truly,\nW. General Manager.\nEXHIBIT P. 7\nSept. 29, 1931.\nAttention Mr. Owan, loss manager.\nStandard Marine Insurance Co.

Winch\u201d\nJames Richardson & Sons Limited.\nWe confirm our telephone conversation of yesterday, and the writer-did not call you back inasmuch as we had been in communication with your surveyor here, Mr. Crocker, representing Messrs. Hayes, Stuart & Co. Ltd., and he advised us he had received a wire from you asking if he would recommend that Richardsons\u2019 bid be accepted, on account of it being the highest tender received.\nWe had a meeting in our office, with Mr. Crocker, Mr. Joseph Byrne, grain broker, and the writer, and we are enclosing herewith copy of letter which we have to-day addressed to Messrs. Hayes, Stuart & Co. Ltd. on your behalf, for your records. We feel quite sure that this bid is a very-good one, and inasmuch as the grain is sold, we trust to be able to get this claim cleared away as quickly as possible. Captain Hayes is expected back in the city to-morrow, and the writer will follow up with him the whole case, and trust that we will be able to assist him in obtaining the necessary information so he can recommend payment of our clients\u2019 claim, which we are of opinion is quite just.\nYours very truly,\nW. General Manager.\nEncl. It appears to me that any question that might arise as to what had occurred is set at rest by Captain Hayes\u2019 report to the respondent in which it is stated:\nThe consignee requested the underwriters agreement to call for bids on the entire amount of 98,099 bushels to be sold for the benefit of whom it may concern. This was agreed to by underwriters without prejudice.\nMost favourable bid received from Mesisrs. James Richardson & Sons, Limited, Winnipeg, 46\u00bc cents less \u00bc cent brokerage commission per bushel, and acceptance of same agreed to, on behalf of whom it may concern, and without prejudice as to underwriters\u2019 liability. Copy of confirmation received from consignee\u2019s representative.\nIt was apparently thought in the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the appellant was endeavouring to prove some custom, but a perusal of the evidence has satisfied me that, throughout, the appellant relied upon this definite arrangement, and that the evidence as to any custom was introduced merely to show that what was done here was common practice, although Captain Hayes testified that it was usual only when liability was admitted. I agree with the learned trial judge that the arrangement alleged by the appellant was in fact made with Hayes, Stuart & Company Limited, the respondent\u2019s surveyor. And in my opinion, its authority was sufficient for that purpose. It was not suggested by the respondent in its factum or in argument that, if the arrangement had been made, the surveyor had not a mandate, to agree on behalf of the respondent insurance company.\nIn any event, the letter of September 29\/31 from Mr. Oldfin to the respondent (exhibit P-7), and particularly the part italicized shows that the question of accepting the appellant\u2019s offer for the damaged grain has been a matter of discussion with the United States head office of the respondent company. Mr. Oldfin testified that this letter and exhibit P-8 were correct reports of what had transpired. To neither letter was any reply ever sent, so that if there could be any doubt as to the antecedent authority of Hayes, Stuart & Company, Limited, the respondent must be taken to have adopted the actions of their surveyor.\nIt was contended that the appellant could not sell to itself, but whether the transactions could be called a sale or by any other name, it did serve to fix the value of the damaged grain. As a matter of fact, the appellant, by having the elevator company turn and dry the wheat. secured a greatly increased price for it when they ultimately sold, and it is urged that as the appellant was bound by the \u201csue and labour\u201d clause of the policy to do all it could to minimize the damage, it would have to bring into the account the price thus secured. Undoubtedly, the \u201csue and labour\u201d clause would have applied if it had not been for the agreement between the representatives of the parties, but in view of that agreement, I cannot see how the provisions of that clause may be invoked by the respondent. What would have been the attitude of the respondent in case the highest bidder for the damaged grain had been a third party, or in case the appellant had sold the re-conditioned wheat for very much less than the offer it made and the expense of turning and drying? No doubt under the latter circumstances, the respondent would have objected strenuously to any claim for extra loss after the value of the damaged grain had been fixed in the manner indicated.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench, considering that the appellant was alleging a custom under the circumstances to call for bids for the damaged grain, determined that no such custom had been proved. They therefore took into account the amount for which the appellant ultimately sold the reconditioned grain and found the loss under the policy to be $4,448.58. For the reasons already indicated, I must respectfully disagree.\nThe amount of the damage, therefore, suffered by the appellant is the sum of $18,500 as found by the trial judge. However, in my opinion, this is not the amount for which the respondent is liable under the terms of the policy and certificate. This was a partial loss and according to article 2535 of the Quebec Civil Code:\nThe amount for which the insurer is liable on a partial loss is ascertained by comparing the gross produce of the damaged sales with the gross produce of the sound sales and applying the percentage of difference to the value of the goods as specified in the policy, or established in the manner provided for by the last preceding article.\nThe agreement did not purport to alter this rule of law.\nArticle 2535 C.C. is similar to section 71 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1906 (Imp.) 6 Edw. VII, c. 41, and in accordance with these provisions the amount for which the respondent is liable is ascertained as follows: The insured value of the cargo was $63,852.84. According to appellant\u2019s exhibit, P. 4 (which, for this purpose, is accepted by the respondent in its factum) the gross produce of the damaged sales was $44,352.84. The sound value of the grain on September 1st, 1931, the first day of unloading at Montreal, was 52\u215b cents per bushel. (With this figure the respondent agrees although in its factum it is erroneously stated to be the price on September 2nd). The total sound value of the cargo is therefore $51,205.08. The difference between the sound and damaged values is $6,852.24 which is 13.382% of the sound value. This percentage of the insured value of the total quantity of wheat delivered at Montreal $63,852.84 amounts to $8,544.79 which is the loss for which the respondent is liable.\nFor the judgment a quo I would substitute a declaration that the appellant is entitled to an indemnity of $8,544.79 which is totally compensated for by the sum of $11,938.42, admittedly owing by the appellant to respondent.\nAs the respondent disputed liability for any amount, the appellant is entitled to costs in the Superior Court. Justice would be done, in my opinion, if the respondent be given the costs of the appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and the appellant the costs of the appeal and, as already indicated, the costs of the cross-appeal, to this Court.\nCannon J.\u2014The plaintiff-appellant have brought before this Court a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec modifying a judgment of the Superior Court in their favour by reducing the recovery, under a marine insurance policy, from $18,500 to $4,448.58, which latter amount was declared compensated. The trial judgment assessed the damages to a grain cargo as it was determined by the parties on its arrival at Montreal, while the Court of King\u2019s Bench took the view that only the ultimate loss to the appellant had to be considered.\nBoth courts were unanimous in finding that the loss or damage came from an external cause and that the respondents were liable under the terms of the policy. This liability has been strenuously denied throughout; and even before us, in his factum, the respondent has reviewed all the facts in order to show that the grain must have been of inferior grade when first placed on board. This Court took the view, however, that these findings could not be challenged any longer; and the only question before us is the following: In point of time, under the terms of the policy, when and how was the damage to this cargo to be ascertained?\nThe respondent issued an open marine insurance policy by which the appellants\u2019 goods were insured on board vessels, boats\nat and from ports and places to ports and places on a lawful and regular route and voyage, for the several amounts, and at the rates as hereon indorsed, subject to condition of this policy, or of any contract proposition covered by this policy, according to their true intent, and meaning.\nBeginning the adventure upon the said property from and immediately following the loading thereof at the port or place named in the endorsement, and so shall continue and endure until the same shall arrive and be safely landed at the port of destination and not to exceed forty-eight hours from the time of arrival.\nTouching the adventures and perils which this company is contented to bear and take upon itself, they are of the lakes, rivers, canals, railroads, fires, jettisons, and all other perils or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment, or damage of the said property or any part thereof, excepting all perils, losses or misfortunes arising from the want of ordinary care and skill in loading and stowing the cargo of, or in navigating the said vessel, from theft, barratry or robbery, or other legally excluded causes. And in case of loss or misfortune, it shall be lawful and necessary to and for the insured or insurer, their agents, factors, servants, and assigns, to sue, labour and travel for, in and about the defense, safeguard and recovery of the said goods and merchandise, or any part thereof, without prejudice to this insurance; nor shall the acts of the insured or insurers, in recovering, saving and preserving the property insured, in case of disaster, be considered a waiver or an acceptance of abandonment nor as affirming or denying any liability under this policy, but such acts shall be considered as done for the benefit of all concerned, without prejudice to the rights of either party; to the charges whereof the said company will contribute in such proportion as the sum herein insured bears to the whole value of the property so insured. Moneys and bullion, promissory notes, and other evidences of debt, books of accounts, written securities, deeds, or other evidences of title to property of any kind, are not covered by this policy unless expressly defined as so insured.\n* * *\nAnd in case of loss or damage to the property hereby insured, this company, its agent or representative at or nearest the first port of discharge shall have prompt notice of same, and shall have every opportunity and facility for ascertaining the cause, extent and amount of damage, by personal inspection, appraisal, or sale of the damaged property.\nClause 10 of the schedule attached to the policy is to the effect that:\nIt is hereby specially understood and agreed that risks on grain while in elevators are in no case to be covered hereunder.\nUnder clause 12, the policy includes the risk of winter storage at port of destination after the close of navigation and during the season of navigation, when required * * * . such risks to foe held covered until discharge at destination.\nClause 14:\n14. It is understood and agreed that shipments insured hereunder are held covered until discharged from vessel for a period not exceeding eighteen (18) days after arrival. After seventy-two (72) hours an additional premium to be charged pro rata of the fifteen (15) day tariff rate as provided for under rate tariff.\nUnder this policy, the appellant shipped, on or about the 4th day of July, 1931, a cargo of no. 3 northern Manitoba wheat which was transhipped at the port of Kingston and was ultimately tendered to the Harbour Commissioners\u2019 elevator at Montreal, who refused it, on the ground that the wheat was out of condition, or had become \u201ctough\u201d after contact with water.\nIn my opinion, the risk incurred by the respondent was limited to the voyage; and the condition of the cargo had to be ascertained when it arrived at its destination. Was it, or was it not, at that time, in the same condition, or of the same grade, as when it was loaded at Fort William and its value fixed at $0.65 a bushel?\nThis must be answered in the negative. The parties, therefore, proceeded to determine the extent of the damages to the cargo. The appellants\u2019 insurance brokers were instructed to take up the matter; and the appellants eventually placed a valuation, or a bid of 46\u00bc cents with a grain broker, Mr. J. A. Byrne. The matter of investigating the loss and of assessing this damage has been placed by the insurance company respondent in the hands of Hayes, Stuart & Co. of Montreal. The insurance broker, Mr. Oldfin, states that these people represented the respondent company and he wrote the respondent, under date September 29th, 1931:\nSept. 29th, 1931\nStandard Marine Insurance Co.

Limited:\nGentlemen:\u2014\nRe Barge \u201cRedhead\u201d\nEx \u201cAnna C. Minch\u201d\nWe confirm conversation of yesterday in our office with Mr. Joseph Byrne, grain broker, and yourself, regarding the disposition of 98,099 bus. Tf. no. 3 northern Manitoba wheat unloaded at Montreal.\nAs authorized by you, we notified Messrs. James Richardson & Sons Limited, Winnipeg, that their bid was accepted for account of whom it may concern, without prejudice, on the basis of 46\u00bc cents per bushel c.i.f. Montreal, as this was the highest tender received by Mr. Byrne. Two other bids were received, one from Messrs. Turgeon Ltd. of 45 cents with a contingent warranty that he would only take delivery of 5,000 or 10,000 bushel lots at the rate of 20,000 bus. weekly; and one other bid from Toronto Elevators Limited, Toronto, which we understand was equal to about 42\u00bd cents per bushel.\nYou will no doubt recall from Mr. Byrne\u2019s conversation, that it was with extreme difficulty that he was able to get any bids whatsoever on this wheat; exporters stated that no demand was available for this grade of wheat, and from a domestic consumption viewpoint it would have to be carried for some time before it could be finally disposed of, and the carrying charges would probably amount to considerable. We are of the opinion that the tender put forward by Messrs. Richardson & Sons Limited is a very generous one.\nByrne, the grain broker, says:\nA. I was approached by two parties; one was Mr. Crocker and the other representing the underwriters, as I understand, and Mr. Oldfin of the Commercial Insurance Agency. They asked me to canvas the trade and to see what price I could get for the wheat, not to make ready the sale of it, but to give them the figures when I would finally get my last figures in. These figures I obtained after working a few days on it. I don\u2019t just remember how many days, but the prices ranged from 43.167 to 45 and \u00be c.i.f., Montreal.\nQ. How many bids did you get, and from whom?\nA. I had four bids altogether. I had approached nine or ten different buyers. Not every buyer can handle that quantity of wheat and pay for it, so I approached the mills and they would not make a bid of any kind. I went to Mr. Turgeon and he bid, and he bid me 43 cents to be taken at his call, five or ten thousand bushels weekly or semi-monthly, he to pay all the charges until he would take final delivery. Another firm was the A. N. Brown Grain Company. They offered me 45 and \u00be, and I had the Toronto Elevators. They offered me 11 cents under the October option, and the October option at that time was 54. That would make a price of 43 cents. Those were the only three offers I could get out of the market.\nQ. What was the best offer you got?\nA. The best offer I had in Montreal was 45 and \u00be.\nQ. From whom did you receive that?\nA. The A. N. Brown Grain Company.\nQ. Did you accept that offer?\nA. No, we did not accept that offer.\nQ. What was the offer you accepted?\nA. 46 and \u00bc cents.\nQ. That was the highest bid you received?\nA. That was the highest bid I received.\nQ. Were you in a position to sell this grain to anybody?\nA. I was not in a position to sell it without first communicating with Mr. Crocker and Mr. Oldfin, the underwriters and the insurance agents.\nQ. And that was the best offer you obtained?\nA. That was the best figure I was able to obtain.\nQ. Did you report that back to Mr. Crocker or to the representative of the Hayes Stuart Company?\nA. I reported to both of them.\nQ. And to Mr. Oldfin?\nA. Yes.\nWilliam A. Barclay, average adjuster, manager of the claims department of G. U. Price Limited, who had placed this insurance, testifies that when, on September 9th, he was informed that quite a serious damage had been found in the cargo of the barge and that the elevator had refused to accept it as no. 3 northern and that it was held what they called \u201cI.P.\u201d (to preserve its identity), he\nadvised Captain Hayes and called the respondent, in New York, over long distance; told them what I had been advised and told them that Captain Hayes was looking after it.\nQ. Captain Hayes would be then acting as surveyor for the Standard Marine Insurance?\nA. Yes.\nHe further states that he got in touch with Captain Hayes with the object \u201cto report to the Standard Marine.\u201d\nCaptain Hayes himself, when examined by the respondent, testifies that his duties as surveyor consisted, on behalf of the underwriters, to look after all sorts of claims in connection with cargoes. He confirms that lie was advised by Mr. Barclay, of G. U. Price Limited, that the barge had some damage at its cargo. And here is what he says:\nQ. Well, now, was there any discussion between you and Mr. Oldfin in connection with the disposal of this cargo?\nA. This cargo was in the hands of James Richardson, the consignee; the cargo as far as I was concerned never left their possession. They were the owners of the cargo. Mr. Oldfin then, in course of time, telephoned that we should call for bids in order to find out what the market value of this grain was. They owned the cargo, they have a perfect right to call for bids for their own property.\nQ. What did you say to that?\nA. As far as I was concerned and the underwriters, I was quite agreeable, without prejudice to the underwriters\u2019 interest, and Mr. Oldfin calling for bids.\nAnd he points out clearly that the object of asking for bids was\nto ascertain what the market price was for this damaged grain in order that he could then ascertain what the extent of the claim was if the underwriters were liable.\nCrocker, who represented Captain Hayes when he went over to Mr. Oldfin\u2019s office to meet Mr. Byrne, said that he was agreeable to accept the highest bid of 46\u00bc cents per bushel, on condition there was no acknowledgment of liability on the part of the underwriters and that he would report to Captain Hayes.\nThe latter\u2019s written report of his survey says that he was acting at the request of the respondent and on its behalf when he attended on board the barge Red Head on September 3rd, 1931, in order to ascertain as to the nature and extent of the damage to this cargo of grain.\nHayes also reported that the consignees requested the underwriters\u2019 agreement to call for bids on the entire amount of 98,099 bushels to be sold for the benefit of whom it may concern. This was agreed to by underwriters without prejudice; and he enclosed a copy of the above quoted letter of 29th September, 1931, from Mr. Oldfin to the insurance company.\nA careful study of the evidence and of the correspondence exchanged justifies the conclusion of the learned trial judge that, in order to assess the damage to the grain at the end of the voyage, all parties interested, under reserve of the determination of the question whether or not the damage had come from an external cause or from an inherent defect in the grain, ascertained what was the best obtainable price for the cargo as it then stood at the end of the voyage or adventure. I do not attach much importance to the technical objection that no sale could take place because the highest bid, which was accepted, came from the appellant. If any of the other three tenders had been accepted coming from outside, a sale would have taken place. The appellants, by tendering 46\u00bc cents a bushel in reality figured out the amount of their claim to less than it would have been if they had sold the damaged grain to the other tenderers. When this figure was accepted by their Montreal representative, Captain Hayes, the respondent determined, for the purposes of this case, the quantum of damages suffered during the voyage and covered by the policy. It was never intended that the future fate or condition of the grain, after it was landed, should affect the rights or liability of either party under the policy. If the grain had further deteriorated after landing, the appellant would have had no recourse against the respondent, whose liability was limited to damages by external cause during the voyage.\nThe \u201csue and labour\u201d clause relied upon by the Court of King\u2019s Bench applies during the existence of the risk, which is strictly limited, and endures until safely landed at the port of destination, and is \u201cnot to exceed forty\u201d eight hours from the time of arrivai.\u201d After the cargo reached Montreal, nothing useful under the policy could be done for the defence, safeguard or recovery of the goods. The acts of the insured or insurers under that clause are confined to the recovering, saving and preserving the property in case of disaster during the voyage or adventure. There is no question of recovery after the arrival and assessment of damages.\nWith the terms and ambit of the policy, and the written documents of record, I cannot see how we could possibly disturb the findings of the learned trial judge that the damage was ascertained by agreement of all interested parties for the purpose of any future litigation, and that the amount so determined must be considered as the damage recoverable under the policy, if the other conditions thereof are complied with.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench gave to plaintiff what they never sued for. The declaration does not mention the disbursements made after the settlement, to recondition the wheat. These are not recoverable as damages but only if and when the \u201csue and labour\u201d clause is applicable and invoked by the insured to make the insurer contribute to the expense incurred in such recovery\u2014at a time and place within the scope of the policy, that inures to the benefit of the insurer. Nothing of the sort was alleged by the appellant.\nNow as to the application of article 2535 C.C.\nThe issue of the certificate by the insurer fixed the value of the cargo at 65 cents per bushel. What was the effect of the issue of this certificate on the policy? Was it valued or unvalued?\nAccording to Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd ed. vbo. Marine Insurance. No. 316.\nA policy may be either valued or unvalued.\nA valued policy is one which specifies the agreed value of the subject-matter insured: an unvalued or, as it is frequently called, an open policy is one which does not specify the value of the subject-matter but, subject to the limit of the sum insured, leaves it to be subsequently ascertained.\n* * *\nThe difference in legal effect between the two policies is that in the case of an unvalued policy the value of the subject-matter insured is not admitted but has to be subsequently ascertained, whereas in the case of a valued policy, unless it be voidable on the ground of fraud or for some other reason, the value fixed by the policy is as between the insurer and assured conclusive of the value of the subject intended to be insured.\nDalloz, R\u00e9pertoire de L\u00e9gislation, vbo. Droit Maritime, says:\n1722. En principe, l\u2019\u00e9valuation des choses assur\u00e9es est * * * fix\u00e9e par la police * * *\n1723. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de la chose assur\u00e9e, dans la police, a pour but d\u2019\u00e9viter les d\u00e9bats relatifs \u00e0 la valeur de cette chose. Elle ne produit cependant pas toujours ce r\u00e9sultat. En effet, l\u2019\u00e9valuation donn\u00e9e par la police a une port\u00e9e, une efficacit\u00e9 plus ou moins grandes, suivant les conditions dans lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Souvent elle n\u2019a d\u2019effet qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019assur\u00e9; il en est ainsi, notamment, lorsque l\u2019estimation des objets se pr\u00e9sente sous la forme d\u2019une simple indication de valeur et qu\u2019elle \u00e9mane de l\u2019assur\u00e9 seul, sans aucune adh\u00e9sion ou acceptation de l\u2019assureur. En pareil cas, l\u2019\u00e9valuation oblige l\u2019assur\u00e9 en ce qu\u2019elle fixe un maximum que ses pr\u00e9tentions ne peuvent jamais d\u00e9passer; mais l\u2019assureur peut toujours exiger de lui qu\u2019il prouve l\u2019exactitude de sa r\u00e9clamation. La simple d\u00e9claration de valeur ne change donc pas les r\u00e8gles sur la charge de la preuve, et les modes indiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 339 doivent toujours \u00eatre employ\u00e9s (Trib. Marseille, 31 ao\u00fbt 1866, Recueil de Marseille, 1866. 1.293; de Valroger, t. 3, no. 1109). Au contraire, lorsque l\u2019estimation est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la police comme valeur agr\u00e9\u00e9e ou valeur convenue, les parties sont li\u00e9es r\u00e9ciproquement par la convention synallagmatique, qui r\u00e9sulte de leur accord sur la valeur de la chose assur\u00e9e; l\u2019assureur, en acceptant cette \u00e9valuation, a, par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, dispens\u00e9 l\u2019assur\u00e9 de justifier de son exactitude, et ce serait \u00e0 lui, s\u2019il pr\u00e9tendait que la valeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, qu\u2019incomberait la preuve de l\u2019exag\u00e9ration. Cette clause valeur agr\u00e9\u00e9e ou convenue de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, ou toute autre clause \u00e9quivalente, a donc pour effet de transporter la charge de la, preuve de l\u2019assur\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019assureur. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence, que, lorsque l\u2019estimation port\u00e9e au contrat d\u2019assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9\u00e9e par les assureurs et qu\u2019ensuite ils opposent \u00e0 la demande en validit\u00e9 du d\u00e9laissement une pr\u00e9tendue exag\u00e9ration de la valeur, c\u2019est \u00e0 eux qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019en faire la preuve (Rouen, 2 juin 1870, aff. Lloyd havrais, D.P. 71.2.125, et sur pourvoi, Req. 20 f\u00e9v. 1872, D.P. 72.1.250) et l\u2019estimation des objets assur\u00e9s, agr\u00e9\u00e9e entre les parties et contenue soit dans la police, soit dans un avenant, dispense l\u2019assur\u00e9 de toute preuve quant \u00e0 la valeur des marchandises, m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 une clause imprim\u00e9e de la police stipulerait que, nonobstant toute valeur agr\u00e9\u00e9e, les assureurs peuvent toujours demander la justification des valeurs r\u00e9elles, et r\u00e9duire\u2019, en cas d\u2019exag\u00e9ration, la somme assur\u00e9e (Req. 12 juin 1876, Benecke, D.P. 77.1.193).

Il y aurait l\u00e0, on le con\u00e7oit, une source de graves difficult\u00e9s. L\u2019intention \u00e9vidente des parties en employant ces mots valeur agr\u00e9\u00e9e est de dispenser l\u2019assur\u00e9 de prouver la valeur des marchandises. S\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement, l\u2019expression valeur agr\u00e9\u00e9e serait synonyme de valeur d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, ce qui est inadmissible.\nThe certificate dated Winnipeg, July 6th, 1931, is for $64,215 or on 98,792.20 bushels no. three (3) northern wheat valued as at sum insured of 65 cents per bushel shipped on board the Anna C. Minch sailing July 4th, 1931, at and from Fort William and Port Arthur to Montreal via Kingston, Ont., and is signed by the respondent and countersigned by Commercial Insurance Agency Ltd. and adds: \u201cFull lake conditions. Average waived.\u201d\nThis is not, strictly speaking, a partial nor a total loss of the cargo but rather a deterioration of the whole cargo causing damage for only part of the sum insured.\nTherefore, there was on board no sound wheat to be sold. There was no possibility, as required by article 2535 C.C., of ascertaining the gross produce of the sound sales to compare them with the gross produce of the damaged sales.\nWe must, therefore, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case and the conduct of the parties, find:\n1. The parties agreed, by the certificate of insurance, to value the goods at 65 cents to all intents and purposes and they acted on that basis;\n2. The open policy, when the certificate issued, became a valued policy\u2014and the parties accepted 0.65 a bushel as the value of the goods to the shipper if it reached destination in sound condition; 3. The respondent pleaded and tried to prove that the wheat was overvalued because this cargo when loaded was not number three northern wheat; in this he has failed before all the courts. The value set by both parties as being that of sound no. 3 Manitoba wheat therefore, for the purposes of this litigation, is and must remain 0.65 a bushel.\n4. Even if we could consider what was the price of sound no, 3 northern Manitoba on the 2nd of September, 1931, on the Montreal market, to satisfy the exigencies of article 2535 C.C., the evidence of record is not satisfactory being based on the telegram D12, which is not definite and states that the price quoted, 51\u00be cents, might vary in Montreal to some extent. The evidence of Gratton, heard as respondent\u2019s witness, shows how complicated is the operation of fixing what was the value of sound no. 3 Manitoba northern when this cargo reached Montreal, and, also proves the wisdom of both the insured and insurer in agreeing to a valuation of this particular grain at a fixed price.\nSi la totalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e d\u2019avaries, on ne peut esp\u00e9rer y trouver un terme de comparaison. Il n\u2019y aura donc d\u2019autre parti \u00e0 prendre, que de faire d\u00e9clarer par des experts, ce qu\u2019ils pensent que pourraient \u00eatre vendus les objets assur\u00e9s, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient rest\u00e9s dans l\u2019\u00e9tat constat\u00e9 par des factures et autres documents. Pardessus. Droit commercial, no. 858.\nThis, as stated above, has not been done in the premises. Moreover, as Pardessus remarks,\nIl faut en revenir au principe sur l\u2019assurance, savoir: que la valeur qu\u2019avaient les choses, \u00e0 leur d\u00e9part, ou qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par la police * * * est la seule mesure d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 doive \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par l\u2019assureur. Or, souvent les marchandises, au lieu de leur arriv\u00e9e, valent beaucoup plus qu\u2019\u00e0 leur d\u00e9part; il peut se faire aussi que, par l\u2019effet de circonstances fr\u00e9quentes dans le commerce, elles valent beaucoup moins. Ces chances ne peuvent influer sur le sort de l\u2019assureur * * * Tout cela est la cons\u00e9quence du principe qu\u2019entre l\u2019assureur et l\u2019assur\u00e9, le r\u00e8glement des avaries doit toujours avoir pour base le capital \u00e9valu\u00e9 dans la police, ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019\u00e9valuation de ce capital, la valeur r\u00e9elle au lieu de l\u2019assurance.\nThis agrees with \u201cElridge on Marine Policies\u201d (1924), p. 204 to 206, where he comments the 1906 English Insurance Act, which lays down certain rules, somewhat similar to our article, which apply, \u201csubject to any express provisions in the policy.\u201d He says: \u201cthe loss must be estimated quite irrespective of the rise or fall at the port of destination,\u201d and he quoted Lord Mansfield in Lewis v. Rucher.[1] The defendant underwriter undertakes the proportion of the difference between sound and damaged at the port of delivery, and pays that proportion upon the value of the goods specified in the policy, and has no regard to the price in money which either the sound or the damaged goods bore in the port of delivery. He says the proportion of the difference is equally the rule, whether the goods come to a rising or a falling market. For instance, suppose the value in the policy 30 (pounds): they are damaged but sell for 40 (pounds): if they were sound they would have sold for 50 (pounds)\u2014the difference is a fifth: the insurer, then, must pay a fifth of the prime cost, or value in the policy\u2014that is, 6 (pounds). E. converso, if they come to a losing market and sell for 10 (pounds) being damaged, but would have sold for 20 (pounds) if sound, the difference is one-half: the insurer must pay half the prime cost, or value on the policy\u2014that is, 15 (pounds).\nThe value of goods adopted as a basis for ascertaining the loss is the valuation in the policy if the policy be a valued one.\nIn this case, in the absence of sound sales or of the evidence of what sound sales would have fetched on the 28th of September, date of the unsound sale alleged and proven, we must, therefore, take the valuation agreed upon by the parties and deduct therefrom the value of the injured grain delivered. This would confirm, on this particular point of the value of the sound cargo, the view of the trial judge and of all the judges in appeal, who have agreed in taking first the fixed value of the cargo in order to determine the depreciation of goods caused by the damage.\nThe certificate has the words: \u201cAverage waived.\u201d Do they refer to a general average or particular average loss? The record does not disclose a sufficient answer. However, it may explain the meaning of a part of Captain Hayes\u2019 testimony:\nQ. And you established that claim by looking at the value of that policy and subtracting from it the amount of the salvage: is it not what you do?\nWitness: It is absolutely wrong.\nQ. What do you do?\nA. This low grade insurance is settled, it is customary to settle it on a salvage basis and not on a P.A. basis. It is customary. I am not saying that it is right.\nThe course adopted by the parties, the conduct of the case and the proven circumstances seem to make it impossible for us to adopt the subsidiary point raised here by the respondent, pressing for the application of the percentage rule of art. 2535 C.C. in order to reduce the sound value of the wheat. The necessary elements are lacking to establish the proportion contemplated by the code. Therefore, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court with costs throughout against the respondent, and would dismiss the latter\u2019s cross-appeal with costs.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree with my brothers Cannon and Kerwin that, whether the acceptance of the appellant\u2019s bid of 46\u00bc cents per bushel, c.i.f., Montreal, for the damaged grain constituted a valid sale to it or not, the calling for bids by Byrne, the grain broker, must be treated as having been fully authorized by the respondent as the best means for ascertaining the saleable value of the damaged wheat for adjustment and settlement of the loss or damage under the certificate of insurance, and that the acceptance of that bid must be taken also as having been agreed to with the full knowledge and approval of the respondent. The testimony of Captain Hayes, the president of Hayes, Stuart & Co., Limited, who was called in to act as cargo surveyor in behalf of the respondent, the letters of the general manager of the Commercial Insurance Agency, Limited, to both Hayes, Stuart & Co., Limited, and to the respondent itself, of September 29th, 1931, and Captain Hayes\u2019 own report to the respondent, quoted in both my brothers\u2019 reasons, are, I think, conclusive, not only upon that question, but upon the question of the perfect bona fides of the whole matter of the calling for bids and the acceptance of the tender. It is true that this arrangement, to which the respondent was thus a party, was stated by Captain Hayes in his testimony as well as in the letters and report referred to, to have been made without prejudice to the Underwriters\u2019 liability, but this reservation of the right of the company, notwithstanding its acceptance of the appellant\u2019s bid, to still dispute the question of its liability on the certificate of insurance, cannot, I think, in the circumstances fairly or justly be relied upon to dispute the genuineness or validity of the method which was adopted to fix the amount of the loss or damage, if any loss or damage did in fact arise from any external cause under the terms of the certificate.\nI think also that my brother Kerwin has adopted the correct basis for determining the difference between the sound and damaged values and agree with him that $8,544.79 represents the real loss for which the respondent is liable under the terms of the certificate and that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench should be altered by substituting for it a declaration to that effect.\nI agree entirely with the disposition he has made of both the appeal and the cross-appeal.\nDavis J. (dissenting in part)\u2014The appellant James Richardson & Sons Limited, shipped by water in July, 1931, a cargo of approximately 100,000 bushels of grain from Port Arthur to Montreal. At the point of shipment the gram was certified by Government officials to be of the quality of no. 3 northern, that is, with a maximum moisture content not in excess of 14.5%. When the grain was unloaded in Montreal on September 1st and 2nd (it having arrived on July 13th but remained in the barge Redhead in harbour till the days of its unloading) it was refused by the harbour officials as no. 3 northern because it then had a moisture content in excess of 14.5% and was thereupon classified as a cheaper grade of grain. The excess moisture was attributed by the Richardson Company to a rainfall at Kingston on the day that the grain in transit was at that place transferred from the vessel which had carried it down the Great Lakes to the barge Redhead which was used to carry it down the St. Lawrence and through the canals to Montreal. The Richardson Company directed the Montreal Harbour Commission to turn and dry the grain, a process of reconditioning, and as a result of the process the grain came back to a moisture content which permitted it to be again classified as no. 3 northern and during the months of October and November the grain was sold by the Richardson Company on a favourable market and the actual loss suffered amounted to $4,448.58. This represented the cost of turning and drying, warehouse storage charges and the loss of a few bushels that were not retained and dried. The Richardson Company had covered the risk of \u201closs or damage from any external cause\u201d in shipment by a valued marine certificate under a floating policy of marine insurance issued to it by the respondent, Standard Marine Insurance Company Limited, of Liverpool, England, which carried on business in Montreal. The use of marine insurance certificates in connection with floating policies is a comparatively recent development and the history and purpose of such certificates are discussed in a recent number of the Harvard Law Review, Vol. XLIX, 239.\nThere is no dispute between the parties as to the amount of the actual loss. The Richardson Company, however, sued the respondent for the sum of $18,500 on the allegation that it had \u201csold\u201d the grain, with the knowledge and consent of the respondent, at a price which had resulted in a loss within the meaning of the policy and certificate at that amount. This sale was alleged to have taken place on September 28th, 1931. The learned trial judge found that the respondent had by its agents consented to the sale of the damaged grain without prejudice to its right to dispute its liability and he found it ill became the respondent to complain of this sale since it was made for its own benefit. He therefore found the loss or damage on the basis of this alleged sale at $18,500. Upon appeal the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously reversed the judgment as in their opinion there had been no such sale as alleged and they fixed the loss or damage at the amount actually sustained, $4,448.58.\nThat there was no sale as alleged is perfectly plain. The grain was at all times the property of the Richardson Company and it sold and delivered the grain to third parties for the first time during October and November. A grain broker was asked by the adjuster for the Richardson Company to obtain bids toward the end of September on the damaged shipment. Three bids are said to have been obtained either by telephone or in writing but there is very little evidence about these bids because they were really not in issue in the action as framed. The Richardson Company is said to have bid itself the highest price and its own property is treated as having been sold to and bought in by itself. It is absurd to even contend that there was a sale. When the case came to this Court, counsel for the Richardson Company very wisely abandoned the contention that there had been a sale, though its pleading was founded and the judgment at the trial based upon the alleged sale. It was argued that, however ineffective the calling for bids was to establish any actual sale, the calling for bids had been adopted as a reasonable method of ascertaining at the time the real value of the damaged grain and consequently the amount of the loss or damage. No custom of the trade having been pleaded, counsel for the Richardson Company were forced to treat the fictitious sale as something that had been agreed to by the insurance company for the purpose of arriving at the amount of the loss or damage. This was not the case that had been pleaded or made against the insurance company but in any event the evidence falls short in my view of proof of authority by the insurance company to Hayes, its local adjuster, to do other than investigate and report. A mandate to Hayes to enter into an agreement is now sought to be established by the appellant extracting a few words from one sentence in the respondent\u2019s factum\u2014\u201cand respondent in turn had placed the matter in the hands of Hayes, Stuart & Company\u201d. No admission of any such mandate can be taken from those words in the factum. Nor can I read the evidence of Hayes and Crocker as substantially saying any more than that liability in any sum under the policy was denied from the moment the merits of the claim had been investigated but that the Richardson Company persisting in its claim was told that so far as the insurance company was concerned, it could do what it liked. Quite apart from the absence of proof of authority to enter into any binding agreement, that is, I think, the real effect of the evidence.\nThe \u201csue and labour\u201d clause in the policy before us is substantially the same as in Lloyd\u2019s policy (see p. 136, 4th edition, 1932, Chalmer\u2019s Insurance Act 1906) except that the policy in this case adds the words \u201cand necessary\u201d after the words \u201cit shall be lawful.\u201d The English statute, sec. 78 (4), expressly provides with reference to the sue and labour clause that it is the duty of the insured and his agents in all cases to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing the loss. Sue and labour clauses in marine insurance have for their object the encouragement of the insurer and the insured to do work to preserve, after an accident, the property covered by the policy and to make the best of a bad state of affairs. Should they do so, the waiver clause provides that their respective rights shall be in no wise prejudiced by any acts done in pursuance of such object and that the insured shall be entitled to obtain his expenses consequent on the work from the insurers. Under such a clause it is the duty of the insured to take reasonable measures to avert loss.\nArnould on Marine Insurance, 11th ed., Vol. 2, p. 1131, in discussing the proper effect of the usual sue and labour clause, says that prevention of loss is the very object in view and that the clause contemplates the benefit of the insurers only and the insurers on that account undertake for the expenditure. The illustration of Willes J. in Kidston v. Empire Ins. Co.[2] is adopted for the purpose of shewing that cases do frequently occur in which the insurers by the operation of this clause are saved from loss and the damage done is thrown upon the assured.\nFor instance, under a policy on goods warranted free from average under 5 per cent, the goods, suppose, have been wetted by sea water; the damage to them, unless they are taken out and dried, would go on increasing beyond the 5 per cent, till it threatened the cargo with destruction; but they are dried at an expense of 3, 2 or 1 per cent, and the damage done is less than 5 per cent. The insurers bear the cost of drying, and the assured the loss by sea damage.\nThe case of Meyer v. Ralli[3] is discussed in Arnould at p. 1133 as a good illustration of the principles established by the previous decisions. There a cargo of rye was insured by a policy warranted free of particular average. The voyage was necessarily abandoned, owing to perils of the sea; part of the rye was so damaged that it had to be sold at once, the rest could have been profitably reconditioned and forwarded to its destination. This course, however, the captain neglected to take, so that a substantial portion remained in warehouses for more than a year, subject to charges. It was held that the plaintiffs, under the suing and labouring clause, were entitled to recover the expenses of unshipping the whole and conveying it to a warehouse, and of the separation of the comparatively sound part from that which was irreparably damaged, and of the expense of reconditioning the former\u2014all these being expenses necessary in order to avert a total loss. In Hals-bury, 2nd edition, Vol. 18, p. 363, note (b), it is said:\nIt is clear, however, that if the total loss, whether actual or constructive, is before action brought adeemed by the acts of the assured or his servante, the assured cannot recover for a total loss, but is entitled to be recouped, under the suing and labouring clause, the expenses incurred in saving the subject-matter insured,\nand the Kidston case[4] is cited in support of the statement. In any event, marine insurance is a contract of indemnity and the actual loss sustained by the appellant is not in dispute and for that amount it has recovered judgment but now seeks in this Court to increase the amount of its recovery from its actual loss of $4,448.58 to the sum of $18,500 on the grounds above outlined. In Castellain v. Preston[5], Brett, L.J., said:\nThe very foundation, in my opinion, of every rule which has been applied to insurance law is this, namely, that the contract of insurance contained in a marine or fire policy is a contract of indemnity, and of indemnity only, and that this contract means that the assured, in case of a loss against which the policy has been made, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. That is the fundamental principle of insurance, and if ever a proposition is brought forward which is at variance with it, that is to say, which either will prevent the assured from obtaining a full indemnity, or which will give to the assured more than a full indemnity, that proposition must certainly be wrong.\nIt may be that notwithstanding the sue and labour clause the insured would have been entitled to have the loss or damage measured at the date of the unloading of the cargo and was not bound to run the risks incidental to reconditioning and holding the grain for a favourable market, if it had dealt with the grain and commenced its action upon that basis and evidence of bona fide sales and real values had been directly put in issue and established. But it is unnecessary in my view to determine that point in this case.\nIn the result I agree with the amount of the loss fixed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the appeal of the Richardson Company therefrom in my view should be dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent the insurance company cross appealed, however, on the question of liability. It contends that the evidence does not establish as a fact that there was any loss or damage caused \u201cfrom any external cause\u201d within the meaning of the policy and that the action should have been dismissed. The contention is that having regard to the quantity of grain and the amount of the rainfall at Kingston the day in question, it was physically impossible for the quantity of water necessary to increase the content of moisture in the grain from that certified at Port Arthur to that found on the arrival of the grain at Montreal to have reached the grain during the rainfall at Kingston and that the Richardson Company having pleaded only the rainfall at Kingston as the cause of the damage, it must be concluded that the grain was not of the moisture content it was certified to have been when it left Port Arthur and that the certificate being only prima facie evidence, the weight of the evidence at the trial was sufficient to rebut it. I must confess that a careful reading of the evidence leads me to believe that a strong defence was made out by the respondent on the question of liability but the trial judge and the Court of King\u2019s Bench are in agreement that liability was as a matter of fact established and I cannot say that they are so clearly wrong as to entitle us to interfere with that concurrent finding. The cross-appeal of the respondent therefore should also be dismissed With Costs.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant and cross-respondent: Brown, Montgomery and McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent and cross-appellant: Beauregard, Phillimore & St. Germain.\n[1] (1761) 2 Burr. 1167.\n[2] (1866) L.R. 1 C.P., 535, at 543, 544.\n[3] (1876) L.R. 1 C.P.D. 358.\n[4] (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 535.\n[5] (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 380 at 386\n",

Instantly the vapour in the tank caught fire, an explosion occurred and the boat was in the midst of flames. Very substantial loss was sustained by the appellants, the owners of the tug, and they sued the respondents upon a policy of fire insurance for the amount of their entire loss. The respondents contended that they were not liable for the loss attributable to explosion, but only for that part of the loss actually caused by fire. The policy contained the following printed clause: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by agreement in \u201cwriting added hereto this company shall not be liable for loss or \u201cdamage occurring * * * (g) by explosion or lightning, unless fire \u201censue, and, in that event, for loss or damage by fire only.\u201d\nHeld that by the terms of the policy recovery by the appellants must be limited to the proportion for fire damage as distinguished from explosion damage. Hobbs v. Guardian Fire & Assurance Co. (12 Can. S.C.R. 631); Curtis\u2019s & Harvey, Ltd. v. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. ([1921] 1 A.C. 303); Stanley v. Western Ins. Co. (L.R. 3 Ex. 71) and Re Hooley Hill Rubber & Chemical Co. v. Royal Ins. Co. ([1920] 1 K.B. 257) disc.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The language of the printed clause in the policy is not limited to cases where the fire was originated by the explosion but includes cases where the explosion occurs in the course of a fire. By the policy, the respondents insured the appellants against \u201call direct loss or damage by fire.\u201d The printed clause in the policy, however, defined or limited the risk and excluded damage caused immediately by explosion.\nPer Rinfret and Cannon JJ.\u2014In this case, the insurers agreed to pay fire damage if the fire was caused by an explosion. In order to carry out the intention of the parties as expressed in the policy and in view of the opinion of both courts below on the evidence and its application to the terms of the policy, the recovery by the appellants must be limited to the loss caused by fire which followed or was concurrent with the explosion. Robbs case (supra) dist.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, McDougall J. and condemning the respondents in the amount of $4,475.94 in an action brought by the appellants in which damages were claimed in the total amount of $38,230.65 under three insurance policies.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and Russell McKenzie K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. T. Hackett K.C. and G. B. Osier K.C. for the respondents. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014A foolhardy fireman on an oil-burning tug, desirous of ascertaining for the information of the captain whether there was enough fuel oil in the boat to enable her to proceed with her journey without re-loading, opened a manhole on the boat, lit a match and held the burning match over the manhole with a view to seeing the quantity of fuel oil in the tank. Instantly the vapour in the tank caught fire; an explosion occurred and the boat was in the midst of flames. Very substantial loss was sustained by the appellants, the owners of the tug, and they sued the respondent upon a policy of fire insurance for the amount of their entire loss. The policy specifically provided that such explosives as might be necessary in connection with the operations of the appellants might be carried on the vessel without prejudice to the insurance. The respondent contends that under certain exceptions in the policy it is not liable for the loss attributable to explosion but only for that part of the loss actually caused by fire.\nIn point of strict, literal fact, the burning match was the cause of the explosion. In other words, the explosion was caused by fire, not by concussion or other physical agency as distinguished from fire. On the question whether or not the damage caused by the explosion, that is to say, by the disruptive effect of the explosion, was within the terms of the policy: Hobbs v. Guardian Fire & Life Assurance Co.[1] would appear to be an authority binding upon us. I am unable, however, to see that it matters in this case whether this view that the explosion was caused by fire or the view that the explosion was not an explosion caused by fire within the meaning of the policy, be accepted. In either case, by the terms of the policy, damage caused by the explosion and not by fire ensuing upon the explosion, or concurrent with the explosion, is excluded from the policy.\nFurther, it is quite unnecessary to determine whether or not the policy is governed by the provisions of the Quebec Insurance Act. That statute was invoked only for the purpose of showing that statutory condition no. 11 was, by force of the statute, imposed upon the policy as a matter of law though not actually printed or written upon the policy, if the policy was one that had been delivered to the insured in Quebec. In this connection, it was contended that certain clauses in the policy could not be treated as variations of the statutory condition because they were not printed or written upon the policy in red ink as required by the Quebec statute. It was held in the Hobbs case[2] and affirmed in the Curtis\u2019s & Harvey (Canada) Ltd. v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Co. Ltd.[3] that statutory condition no. 11 relates to an explosion which originates a fire and not to an explosion caused by a fire; and, by that condition, the insurer is responsible for the fire resulting from the explosion. There has been no substantial change in the wording of statutory condition no. 11 in the Quebec statute since the Curtis\u2019s case3 but it makes no difference in this case whether or not that condition was part of the policy or was effectively varied by the policy.\nThe policy in this case contains the following printed clause:\nUnless otherwise provided by agreement in writing added hereto this company shall not foe liable for loss or damage occurring\n(g) by explosion or lightning, unless fire ensue, and, in that event, for loss or damage by fire only.\nIt will be necessary to return to this printed clause later but for the moment I turn to certain typewritten clauses which were added to the printed form of policy in this particular case. Only one of the specific typewritten clauses was relied upon but before referring to it the following general clause in typewriting appears in the policy:\nThese clauses shall be considered to supersede and annul any other clauses to the same or similar effect, printed in or attached to this policy, and that for the purposes of construction these clauses shall be deemed of the nature of written additions thereto.\nNow the specific typewritten clause relied upon reads as follows:\nIn the event of loss or damage to the subject of insurance by any peril or cause not covered by this policy, followed by fire or with which fire is concurrent, this company shall only be liable for that part of the damage actually caused by fire, whether the loss be partial or total.\n* * * Dealing with this last clause, this stipulation is entitled to be given its full effect but it is to be observed that the event specifically covered by it is \u201closs or damage to the subject of insurance by any peril or cause not covered by this policy.\u201d This stipulation, however, can have no application to the facts of the case before us if we have here a fire followed by an explosion rather than an explosion followed by a fire, because the peril of a fire followed by an explosion is covered by the policy. The specific stipulation points to a peril or cause not covered by the policy and therefore does not come into play upon the facts of this case.\nReverting now to the printed clause, above set out, in the policy before us, which expressly excepts liability for loss or damage \u201coccurring by explosion or lightning, unless fire ensue, and, in that event, for loss or damage by fire only.\u201d The object of that clause was clearly to restrict and limit the risk. It was in fact a contractual condition that the risk should be so limited. The first question that arises in considering this clause is whether or not the specific typewritten clause, above set out, by virtue of the general typewritten clause, superseded and annulled this printed clause as being one \u201cto the same or similar effect.\u201d The typewritten clauses are expressly agreed to be \u201cdeemed of the nature of written additions\u201d to the policy, whereas the printed clause was clearly intended to limit and restrict the risk. The point is one of some difficulty but I incline to the view that the two clauses may stand independently of one another. That being so, the question then arises as to whether or not the printed clause is so general and unlimited in its scope that it may fairly be read as applying \u201cto the whole risks in which the explosion takes part\u201d and not confined to the case where an explosion originates a fire. If so confined, the clause does not apply to the case before us if the case is to be properly treated as a fire followed by an explosion. If, on the other hand, the printed clause is to be given such a general construction as to apply to every case whether an explosion originates or merely takes part in the fire, the clause would apply to the facts of this case. Now in the Curtis\u2019s case[4] the Judicial Committee had to consider the scope and extent of the following clause:\nWarranted free of claim for loss or damage caused by explosion of any of the material used on the premises.\nThe Judicial Committee said that those words were \u201cabsolutely general and in no way limited\u201d and \u201cthat the more natural construction is to apply the words of exception to the whole risks in which the explosion takes a part.\u201d\nStanley v. Western Insurance Co.[5] was considered in the Curtis\u2019s decision4 as a case which explained an exception. In that policy, which was against fire, the insurer, in terms of the policy, was not to be liable for loss or damage by explosion and the expression was there held to cover all loss by explosion, whether the explosion succeeded to or was caused by a fire, or was prior to and caused a fire. Lord Dunedin pointed out, in the Curtis\u2019s case4, that the Stanley case5 was followed by the English Court of Appeal in In Re Hooley Hill and Royal Insurance Co.[6], and then said:\nThese cases are not actually binding on their Lordships but they agree with them. Stanley\u2019s case5 was decided by a very strong Court and has stood as the law of England for many years.\nWe should therefore turn to the specific clauses that were before the courts in the Stanley5 and the Hooley Hill6 cases for they were interpreted as sufficiently wide and general to cover an explosion whether it succeeded to or was caused by a fire or was prior to and caused a fire. Now the clause in the Stanley case5 was this:\nNeither will the company be responsible for loss or damage by explosion, except for such loss or damage as shall arise from explosion by gas.\nThe word \u201cgas\u201d in the policy was held to mean ordinary illuminating coal gas but that is immaterial for our purpose. The point is that the clause was held to be an exemption of liability for loss by explosion, not limited to cases where the fire was originated by an explosion but included cases where the explosion occurred in the course of a fire. Reference to the language of the whole clause in that case shows that\nLosses by lightning will be made good by this company, as far as where either the building or the effects insured have been actually set on fire thereby, and burnt in consequence thereof. The plaintiff in that case contended that the company was not to be responsible for any loss arising from explosion, provided the explosion was not occasioned by a fire already in existence upon the premises, but, on the other hand, if there was already a fire upon the premises so that the explosion was incidental to and occasioned by that fire, and then lent itself to further the fire and so to increase the loss, the whole of the damage caused was within the insurance of the policy.\n\u201cBut to give the instrument this construction,\u201d said Kelly, C.B.[7],\nwould be, in fact, to introduce into it words not found there; while the natural construction of the words gives a probable and easily intelligible sense.\nMartin, B., added[8]:\nThere is nothing to qualify the word \u201cexplosion,\u201d and I apprehend, therefore, that the company bargain, and the insured agrees with them, that they are not to be responsible for any loss or damage by explosion. The clause is exceedingly simple, and we should not be justified in adding words to give it the most artificial meaning which (the plaintiff) contended for.\nIn the Hooley Hill case[9], the words of exception in the policy were:\nThis policy does not cover loss or damage by explosion nor loss or damage by fire following any explosion unless it be proved that such a fire was not caused directly or indirectly thereby or was not the result thereof.\nIt was held in that case that the insurers were exempted from liability as to the damage caused by the explosion although the explosion occurred in the course of a fire.\nHaving regard to the statement of Lord Dunedin in the Curtis\u2019s case[10] that the Judicial Committee agreed with these two cases, the Stanley case[11] and the Hooley Hill case9, although they were not actually binding on their Lordships, and to the decision in the Curtis\u2019s case10 itself that the warranty clause there in question applied to the whole risks in which explosion takes a part, we must conclude that the language of the printed clause in the policy before us is not limited to cases where the fire was originated by the explosion but includes cases where the explosion occurs in the course of a fire. By the policy, the respondent insured the appellants against \u201call direct loss or damage by fire.\u201d The printed clause in the policy, however, defined or limited the risk and excluded damage caused immediately by explosion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014On June 16th, 1931, Osborn and Lange, the appellants\u2019 insurance brokers and their agents, applied, in New York, to each of the defendants, for insurance on fifty-two vessels owned by the Sin Mac Lines, Limited, including the tug Rival. All the applications were for insurance for \u201cfire only,\u201d as per form attached thereto. The form thus referred to in the applications was the typewritten form subsequently attached to the policies which are identical.\nThe tug Rival was insured by these three policies for a total amount of $75,000, of which the proportion of the respondent was $37,500 and that of each of the other defendants $18,750.\nA printed condition in each policy provides:\nUnless otherwise provided by agreement in writing added hereto, this company shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring * * * by explosion or lightning, unless fire ensue, and in that event, for loss or damage by fire only.\nThe typewritten form attached to each policy, as it was to the application for insurance, reads as follows:\nFire on vessels clause:\nIn the event of loss or damage to the subject of insurance by any peril or cause not covered by this policy, followed by fire or with which fire is concurrent, this company shall only be liable for the part of the damage actually caused by fire, whether the loss be partial or total and, in the event of said vessel being necessarily moved for repairs this company shall in no way be liable for any part of the expense incurred unless the necessity for removal arises wholly or partly from fire, and then only in the proportion that the cost of the fire damage repair bears to the total cost of all repairs necessitating the removal, and then only when the cost of such removal has been approved by the representative of this company.\nThis typewritten form also provided:\nIt is agreed that these clauses shall be considered to supersede and annul any other clauses to the same or similar effect, printed in or attached to this policy, and that for the purpose of construction these clauses shall be deemed of the nature of written additions thereto.\nA rate of 1.35% was charged as premium. Through the same brokers, the appellants had secured marine insurance from five different companies against explosions, with a typewritten form making the policies free from claim for loss caused by fire or in consequence of fire, whether or not fire ensues as a result of a marine peril.\nThe charge for these policies which covered the tug Rival from August 7th, 1931, to August 7th, 1932, was $8 per $100 of insurance.\nThe Rival was registered at the port of Montreal. On the 10th November, 1931, she was proceeding on a voyage from Port Colborne to Montreal and was tied up for the night in the Welland canal. The captain having made inquiry with regard to the fuel in the tug tanks, one of the firemen, Gendron, to secure the information, removed the manhole cover over the tank on the starboard deck and held a lighted match over this opening for the purpose of illuminating the inside of the tank. Immediately thereafter there was an explosion which caused the conflagration which lasted for about forty minutes, when the tug sank. The appellant sued to recover the sum of $38,230.65, including explosion damages which, the appellant contends, was a direct loss and damage by fire. The respondent denied all liability. The courts below did not allow any explosion damage as recoverable under the policy, but limited the recovery to loss from fire following the explosion: $4,475.94 with interest and costs.\nThe appellants claim that the unanimous judgment of the six learned judges who have considered this case erred in the following respects:\n(a) Effective consideration was not given to the fact that fire did actually precede the explosion and that the explosion was an incident thereof and caused thereby;\n(b) The conditions relied upon by the respondent were illegal and in conflict with the Quebec Insurance Act;\n(c) In the proper interpretation of the policy;\n(d) In the quantum of damages.\nThe learned trial judge says:\nAfter a careful examination of the evidence as to the fact of the accident, as also of the elaborate expert and scientific evidence having to do with the nature, manifestation and characteristics of an explosion, the Court has reached the conclusion that it is practically impossible to dissociate the fire from the explosion. In point of time they were practically simultaneous or concurrent. It is true that the hand, which brought the lighted match to the aperture created by the removal of the manhole cover, introduced a flame (fire) to the gaseous substances contained in the tank, but from that moment the \u201cexplosion\u201d entered the first of the three stages described by Professor Stacey in his testimony, ignition, passed at once into the second, or turbulent phase, and then almost immediately into the third or detonation stage. He describes or defines the word \u201cexplosion\u201d as including three phases: uniform flame propagation, turbulence, and detonation, without all of which there can be no gas explosion. The eye witnesses of the accident speak of the sequence of events as passing with almost instantaneous rapidity, which is quite consistent with the theory expounded by Professor Stacey. Had the lighted match not been applied to the gaseous explosive mixture in the tank no explosion would have occurred and in this restricted sense only can it be said that fire preceded the explosion. It cannot be said that there was a fire, within the meaning of the policies, which burned for an appreciable period, during the course whereof the explosion occurred as an incident of the fire. The element of simultaneity defeats any such theory. So difficult was it found to dissociate fire from explosion, or to state which preceded the other, that the plaintiff itself, in the first notices of the casualty given to the defendants, through their agents, referred to the incident as \u201cexplosion followed by fire.\u201d Similarly, plaintiffs\u2019 agents notified the explosion underwriters of the nature of the casualty as \u201cexplosion followed by fire and sinking in Welland canal.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge then proceeds to determine the exact nature and scope of the risk incurred by the insurers and, in view of the special clauses of the contract above quoted, reached the conclusion that the intention of the parties was to exclude such loss by explosion which would be within the policy under the ruling of this Court in Hobbs v. The Guardian Fire & Life Assurance Co.[12], but for the exception. The first judge also noted that the premium paid on the policies in question in this case was on the rate for fire insurance only and that the appellants carried separate policies covering explosion damages excluding fire losses. Moreover, the trial judge found that, even if the policies were subject to the statutory conditions contained in the Quebec Insurance Act, condition 11 does not conflict with the provisions in the defendant\u2019s policies exempting them from liability for explosion damages.\nThis statutory condition, if applicable to this case, would make them liable \u201cfor all loss caused by fire resulting from an explosion,\u201d which is practically to the same effect as the printed and typewritten clauses above quoted. If the Act applies to exclude the typewritten fire on vessel clause, then the statutory condition would justify the judgments a quo. We have, therefore, in this case a contract against loss by fire containing an exception, as in Stanley v. Western Insurance Company[13], referred to in the case of Curtis\u2019s and Harvey v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Co.[14] by Lord Dunedin. There, the insurer, in terms of the policy based on the insured\u2019s application, was not to be liable for loss or damage by explosion. This expression was held to cover all loss by explosion, whether the explosion succeeded to or was caused by a fire, or was prior to or caused the fire. In our case, the insurer agreed to pay fire damage if the fire was caused by an explosion\u2014but not more. The clause is exceedingly simple and is to be construed according to its natural meaning, and as ordinarily understood by mankind. The Privy Council also agreed with the judgment of the English courts in In re Hooley Hill Co. v. Royal Insurance Co.[15], where full effect was given to an exception memorandum.\nIn the same case, the Privy Council uses words which may well apply to the facts of the present case:\nAs to the true meaning of the word \u201cexplosion,\u201d the parties have been content to leave the Court without any means of judging this from the scientific point of view. Their Lordships do not think they are entitled to read in any knowledge which they may as individuals possess on the subject, but are bound to take it that the parties are agreed to take the word in the popular sense, in which sense it has been used in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the facts given above. But while T.N.T. might burn it might also explode, and it seems to their Lordships impossible to come to any conclusion but that the parties must have contemplated the possibility of an explosion either as an incident or as an originator of fire. It is obvious that if the assurer was content to have this possible risk barred, he would secure an assurance on better terms. When, therefore, he used in his proposal and the insurer accepted in the policy, words which are absolutely general, and in no way limited, their Lordships think that the more natural construction is to apply the words of exception to the whole risks in which explosion takes a part rather than to confine them to the special case provided for by statutory condition 11, to which no reference is made.\nAs pointed out in Hobbs v. Guardian Fire & Life Assurance Co.[16]:\nIt is not so much a question of law as of fact that we are called on to decide.\nIn the latter case, the parties had agreed that the loss was occasioned by some employee accidentally setting fire to some gun powder stored in the premises insured. In this case, in the opinion of the trial judge, the preponderance of evidence shows that the fire damage was subsequent to the explosion and that 85% of the loss must be ascribed not to the burning of the vessel but to the disruptive force of the explosion. In spite of the very able argument of Mr. Chipman, I cannot see my way clear to reach a firm conclusion that all the judges below were wrong in their appreciation of the evidence and their application of it to the terms of the policies. The circumstances of the case make it clearly distinguishable from Hobbs v. Guardian Fire & Life Assurance Co. (1). The appellant\u2019s request for separate policies distinguished the fire risk from the explosion risk and makes it clear to my mind that, in order to carry out the intention of the parties, as expressed in the policies, we must adopt the views of the courts below and limit the recovery to the loss caused by fire which followed or was concurrent with the explosion.\nWe also agree with the trial judge that the amount of the first survey, $19,839.68, to which must be added the salvage account of $10,000, would represent the total loss and that a proportion of 15% should be paid by the respondents as constituting fire damage distinguished from explosion damage.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hannen.\n[1] (1886) 12 Can.

A trustee in bankruptcy applied to a Judge of this Court for leave to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal made on June 29, 1936. The court of original jurisdiction in bankruptcy, acting under s. 163(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, on September 8, 1936, extended the time (which otherwise would have expired on July 29) within which to apply for such leave, its order providing that notice of motion for leave be served on or before September 28, and be made returnable on or before October 12. The notice was served on September 26 and made returnable on October 9; so it was not served \u201cat least 14 days before the hearing thereof\u201d as prescribed by bankruptcy rule 72.\nHeld: The motion could not be heard. A Judge of this Court has no power to excuse a party from compliance with rule 72, nor to abridge the time of notice thereby prescribed. Assuming the court of original jurisdiction in bankruptcy had power to abridge the time of notice, its said order did not do so.\nIn re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Ltd., [1926] Can. S.C.R. 26; In re Gilbert, [1925] Can. S.C.R. 275; In re North Shore Trading Co., [1928] Can. S.C.R. 180, and Boily v. McNulty, [1927] Can. S.C.R. 275, cited.\nThe motion was dismissed; but with reservation of any right in the applicant to obtain from the court having jurisdiction to grant it a further extension of time to renew the application.\nAPPLICATIONS by the Trustee in Bankruptcy for special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which allowed an appeal from the order of Mr. Justice McEvoy[2] dismissing applications for an order rescinding the receiving order made by the Registrar in Bankruptcy and annulling the adjudication in bankruptcy.\nF.K. Ellis for the Trustee.\nLewis Duncan K.C. for T.H. Collings.\nR.M. Willes Chitty for K. Murphy.\nRINFRET J.\u2014The applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada were made to me by the Trustee in these matters on the 9th day of October, 1936.\nThe appeals intended to be lodged, if leave therefor was granted, are from a decision of the Appeal Court pronounced on the 29th day of June, 1936, and application for leave to appeal therefrom ought therefore to have been made on or before the 29th day of July, 1936 (Rule 72 under the Bankruptcy Act); but the court of original jurisdiction in bankruptcy, acting under subs. 5 of s. 163 of the Bankruptcy Act, on the 8th day of September, 1936, extended the time within which the application might be made up to the 12th day of October, 1936. The order so made was\nthat the notice of motion for such special leave, if any, be served upon the parties entitled to notice on or before the 28th day of September, 1936, and that the said notice of motion for such special leave, if any, be made returnable before a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada on or before the 12th day of October, 1936.\nThe notice of motion for leave to appeal now before me was served on the 26th day of September. As aforesaid, it was made returnable on the 9th of October. So that the notice was not \u201cserved on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof,\u201d as prescribed by Bankruptcy Rule No. 72(1).\nThe objection was taken by opposing counsel for the respondents.\nI am precluded by the rule from hearing the motion and from entertaining the application. (In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Limited[3].)\nRule 72 is a statutory rule. Moreover, it is not a rule made under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act and from the compliance with which the Supreme Court of Canada or a Judge thereof may excuse a party under Rule 109 of this Court. The Rule is a Bankruptcy Rule made by the Governor in Council under the provisions of s. 161 of the Bankruptcy Act; and it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. (In re Gilbert; Boivin v. Larue, Trudel & Pich\u00e9[4].) It has been held further that a Judge of this Court had no power, under Supreme Court Rule 108, to enlarge or abridge the delay provided by Bankruptcy Rule 72. (In re Gilbert4; In re North Shore Trading Company[5].) One reason for this is that the competency of this Court, in bankruptcy matters, is to be looked for exclusively in the Bankruptcy Act and the Rules properly made under it; it is not controlled by the sections of the Supreme Court Act dealing with the Court\u2019s ordinary jurisdiction (Boily v. McNulty)[6].\nIn the present instance, Rule 72 was clearly not followed. Under it, the notice must be served \u201cat least\u201d fourteen days before hearing. The use of the words \u201cat least\u201d means that \u201cboth the day of service or of giving notice and the day on which [the application was to be heard] shall be excluded from the computation.\u201d (Bankruptcy Rule 170).\nAssuming the court of original jurisdiction in bankruptcy had the power to abridge the prescribed delay, such delay was not abridged by the order extending the time for applying for leave. The order prescribed an extreme date within which the notice should be served and another date within which the motion should be made returnable. Between the 8th of September (the date of the order) and the 12th of October (the date on or before which the motion was ordered to be made returnable) ample time was provided for complying both with the order and with Rule 72.\nIn the particular instance, counsel for the applicant complained that the 12th day of October happened to fall on a non-juridical day (Thanksgiving day) and that the previous day, the 11th of October, was a Sunday. But, far from operating to the prejudice of the applicant, these events really gave him additional time within which to comply with the order and with the Rule, for in such case he could have made his motion returnable on the 13th day of September and his proceedings would necessarily have been \u201cconsidered as done or taken in due time\u201d (Bankruptcy Act, s. 184; Rule 172).\nI must, therefore, dismiss the motions and the applications with costs; but, as I am not passing on the merits of the applications, I will reserve any right which the applicant may have to obtain from the court having jurisdiction to grant it a further extension of time to renew the applications for special leave to appeal herein made.\nApplications dismissed with costs (with reservation as stated).\nSolicitors for the Trustee (applicant): Ellis & Ellis.\nSolicitor for T.H.

The judge hearing said application was not empowered to adjudicate otherwise.\n(3) Certain taxable costs given the trustee in other proceedings in the course of the bankruptcy should not be embraced in the order now in question so as to give right to a set-off.\nMoreover, contentions to the effect that the costs should be adjudicated against the trustee personally, that they should be taxed according to the tariff prevailing in the bankruptcy courts, and request that a set-off be provided for as aforesaid, could not now be raised for the first time on settlement of the minutes\u2014they were contrary to the intention of the said judgment, and were equivalent to asking amendment thereof; which there was no reason to grant. (Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J.O. Ross Engineering Corpn., [1934] Can. S.C.R. 186, referred to).\nAPPLICATION for settlement of the minutes of the judgment rendered by Rinfret J.[7] dismissing with costs applications by the Trustee in Bankruptcy for special leave to appeal to this Court. The questions had to do with costs of said applications and are sufficiently set out in the judgment now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. J.T. Wilson for T.H. Collings and K. Murphy.\nD.K MacTavish for the Trustee.\nRINFRET J.\u2014Upon application for settlement of the minutes of the judgments rendered by me in these matters on the 31st day of October, 1936, I have come to the conclusion that:\n(1) Edward Wilkins was before me in these matters in his capacity of Trustee. In fact, it was objected at the argument that he had no locus standi precisely because he was making the applications in his capacity of Trustee. The argument in respect of the absence of locus standi would have been without any foundation whatever if he had appeared in his personal capacity.\nIt follows that, on the applications on which I gave decisions, on the 31st day of October, 1936, the dismissal with costs could affect him only as Trustee and could not affect him personally.\n(2) Although these are bankruptcy matters and the Supreme Court of Canada is given jurisdiction to hear appeals therein by the Bankruptcy Act (with the aid of the enabling section 44 of the Supreme Court Act), these appeals are nevertheless made to the same Supreme Court of Canada as is organized under the provisions of sections 3 et seq. of the Supreme Court Act and as is given an appellate jurisdiction within and throughout Canada under section 35 thereof.\nAccordingly, upon appeals in bankruptcy matters, the tariff which applies is that provided for in Rules 91 et seq, of the Court and contained in Form I set out in the schedule to these rules. A Judge of this Court is not empowered to adjudicate otherwise.\n(3) I may say, moreover, that the points now raised by counsel on behalf of the respondents Katherine Murphy and Thomas H. Collings (to the effect that the costs should be adjudicated against the Trustee personally and that they should be taxed according to the tariff prevailing in the bankruptcy courts) were not even mentioned in the course of the argument made before me on the applications for special leave to appeal. I consider that they cannot be raised at this stage, where the only question to be decided upon is the settlement of the minutes of the judgments I have delivered on the 31st of October, 1936. When delivering those judgments, I did not intend that the costs should be adjudicated against Mr. Edward Wilkins personally, nor that they should be taxed by the Registrar of the Bankruptcy Court under the tariff prevailing in that court.\nTo ask me now to settle the minutes so as to give such a meaning to my judgments is equivalent to a demand that I should amend my judgments; and I can see no reason for doing so (Paper Machinery Ltd. et al. v. J.O. Ross Engineering Corpn. et al.[8]).\nI, therefore, order that the judgments be settled so that the costs be payable by the Trustee out of the funds in his hands; and I shall fix the fees upon his applications, if and when counsel will come before me for that purpose.\nAs for the further request that certain taxable costs given the Trustee against the debtor Collings, which remain unpaid, should be embraced in the order, so as to entitle Collings to a set-off, it should not be entertained:\n(a) because the matter was not submitted to me in the course of the argument on the application and, therefore, the same reasons apply as given above to refuse to modify my judgment in other respects;\n(b) I do not think costs incurred upon other matters and other proceedings in the course of the bankruptcy should be set off against the costs on the present applications.\nSolicitor for T.H.

(C.A. 1924, c. 91) as amended in 1930, c. 22\u2014Ss. 8 (4), 4(p)\u2014Exemption of profits of a company \u201caccumulated prior to and undistributed at\u201d December 31, 1929 (s. 4(p))\u2014Exemption not available to company in respect of dividends received by it in 1934 from another company out of latter s profits accumulated prior to and undistributed at December 31, 1929\u2014Construction of statutes.\nS. 8 (4) (enacted in 1930, c. 22) of the Income Tax Act, Man. (C.A. 1924, c. 91) provided that every joint stock company (other than a personal corporation) pay a tax upon the amount of its income within the province during the preceding year; that this tax be paid on April 30, 1931, and annually thereafter. S. 4 (p) (enacted in 1930. c. 22) provided that \u201cprofits of a * * * joint stock company * * * accumulated prior to and undistributed at\u201d December 31, 1929, be not liable to taxation under s. 8 (4).\nIn 1935 appellant company was assessed for income tax in respect of moneys received by it in 1934 as dividends from N. Co., which moneys were part of profits of N. Co. accumulated by N. Co. prior to and undistributed at December 31, 1929.\nHeld: Appellant company was properly so assessed. Read literally, s. 4 (p) applied only to profits in the hands of the accumulating company, and would not exempt appellant company from the liability created by s. 8 (4). The mere fact that, reading s. 4 (p) literally and giving full effect to s. 8 (4), the result might be that s. 4 (p) would be wholly unnecessary, was not sufficient to overcome the language of the statute.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (44 Man. L.R. 228) affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by Thos. Jackson & Sons Ltd. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Dysart J.[2] dismissing its appeal from the Municipal Commissioner of the Province of Manitoba affirming an assessment of the appellant under the Income Tax Act of Manitoba (C.A. 1924, c. 91, and amendments) in respect of the sum of $73,016.08 received by the appellant during the year 1934 as and by way of dividends from Nelson River Construction Ltd. That sum was part of the profits of Nelson River Construction Ltd. which were accumulated by it prior to, and were undistributed at, December 31, 1929. The appellant and Nelson River Construction Ltd. are joint stock companies and neither of them is a personal corporation within said Act.\nSec. 8 (4) (enacted in 1930, c. 22) of said Act provides (as amended in 1932, c. 49, in respects not here material):\nSave as herein otherwise provided, every corporation and joint stock company, other than a personal corporation, no matter how created or organized, carrying on business within the Province shall pay a tax of five per centum upon the amount of its income within the Province during the preceding year.\nThe tax imposed by this subsection shall be paid in the manner provided by this Act on the thirtieth day of April, 1931, and annually thereafter.\nSec. 4 (p) (enacted in 1930, c. 22) provides:\nProfits of a corporation or joint stock company other than a personal corporation accumulated prior to and undistributed at the 31st day of December, 1929, shall not be liable to taxation under subsection (4) of section S of \u201cThe Income Tax Act.\u201d\nThe appellant contended that as the said sum of $73,016.08 was part of the profits of Nelson River Construction Ltd. accumulated by the latter prior to and undistributed at December 31, 1929, the appellant was not liable for income tax under said Act in respect thereof.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nG. L. Cousley for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014In the year 1935 the Manitoba Administrator of Income Tax assessed the appellant, Thos. Jackson and Sons, Limited, for income tax in respect of moneys received by them in the year 1934 from the Nelson River Construction Company, Limited. The moneys so paid were dividends out of profits accumulated by the Nelson Company prior to the 31st December, 1929.\nFrom the decision of the Administrator the appellants appealed unsuccessfully to the Municipal Commissioner, to Mr. Justice Dysart in the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Manitoba and from there to the Court of Appeal in Manitoba where its appeal was unanimously dismissed. It is from that Court that this appeal is now brought to us. The Manitoba income tax law originally applied only to individuals but in 1930 it was amended to apply to companies as well. The material charging section in the amendment then passed, and still in force, is 8 (4) reading as follows:\n8 (4). Save as herein otherwise provided, every corporation and joint stock company, other than a personal corporation, no matter how created or organized, carrying on business within the Province shall pay a tax of rive per centum upon the amount of its income within the Province during the preceding year.\nThe tax imposed by this subsection shall be paid in the manner provided by this Act on the thirtieth day of April, 1931, and annually thereafter.\nThis section taken by itself is clearly sufficient to authorize the assessment of the appellants.\nThere was also inserted in the amendments of that year a section, 4 (p), reading as follows:\n4. The following shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\u2014\n* * *\n(p) profits of a corporation or joint stock company other than a personal corporation accumulated prior to and undistributed at the 31st day of December, 1929, shall not be liable to taxation under subsection (4) of section 8 of \u201cThe Income Tax Act.\u201d\nThis section read by itself clearly would not exempt the appellants from the liability created by 8 (4). Read literally it applies only to profits in the hands of the accumulating company and would not relieve the beneficiaries on any distribution.\nBut it is argued, and with some force, that if section 4 (p) is read literally and section 8 (4) given its full effect, the result would be that 4 (p) would be wholly unnecessary, and the real intention of the Legislature must have been to relieve corporate shareholders from the tax which they would otherwise be liable for under 8 (4), and that effect should be given to this intention.\nHowever, in the absence of some more definite expression of intention by the Legislature, in my opinion we cannot hold that a clear and specific charging section is limited by an exempting section which, read literally, does not impose such a limitation. The mere fact that the effect might be to render the exempting section altogether ineffective is not sufficient to overcome the language of the statute.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Major, Finlayson & Fraser.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Allan.\n[1] 44 Man.

In the present case it was held (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and restoring the judgment of the Surrogate Court Judge at trial), on the evidence, that, at the time of the making of the will, the delusions, which were as to the character and conduct of the testator\u2019s wife, were present and affected the testator\u2019s mind so that he could not rationally take into consideration the interest of his wife; and therefore he lacked the capacity to make a will and the will should not be admitted to probate.\nThe law on the subject discussed; Banks v. Goodfellow, L.R. 5 Q.B. 549, Boughton v. Knight, 3 P. & D. 64, and other cases, referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which reversed the judgment of His Honour F.T. Costello, Esquire, Judge of the Surrogate Court of the United Counties of Dundas, Stormont and Glengarry, who found that at the time of the execution of the will in question the testator was labouring under delusions as to the character and conduct of his wife; that such delusions were fantastic and preposterous and would affect the making of the will; that therefore the testator was not of sound and disposing mind at the time the will was made; and ordered that the will be not admitted to probate. On appeal the Court of Appeal (without written reasons) allowed the appeal and directed that probate be granted.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the Surrogate Court Judge restored. R. Danis K.C. for the appellants.\nR.P. Milligan for the respondent Bernice Grant Ouderkirk.\nJ.M. Baird K.C. for the Official Guardian (representing infant defendants).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The learned Surrogate Court judge directed that the will in question be not admitted to probate for the following reasons:\u2014\nI find that before, at the time, and after the execution of the will, the deceased was labouring under delusions. These delusions were to the effect that his wife was an immoral character, and that she was entertaining men for immoral purposes. His wife, Ellen Jane Ouderkirk, was at the time about seventy years of age. She had borne him eleven children, the youngest of whom was over twenty-one, and the evidence was that she had lived a moral and respectable life.\nHis ideas produced such delusions as were fantastic and preposterous. These delusions would affect the making of the will, and although some provision was made for his wife\u2019s maintenance, I consider that the provisions of the will show that he was influenced by such insane delusions.\nI find, therefore, that the deceased was not of sound and disposing mind at the time the will was made, and I therefore order that the will be not admitted to probate.\nThe one plaintiff executor who was actively concerned in propounding the will, appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and we were informed that that Court at the conclusion of the argument allowed the appeal, but we have not the benefit of the reasons for that judgment. We, therefore, found it necessary to examine the evidence at the trial critically.\nThe will in question was executed October 18th, 1932. The evidence is overwhelming that the testator did have delusions as to his wife from some time in the year 1928. Dr. Gormley, the family physician, states definitely that he observed them on April 28th of that year, and the evidence indicates that it was because some members of the family noticed these manifestations somewhat earlier, that the doctor was consulted. At that time he was prepared to certify that the man should be sent to an asylum but that was not done as the family decided not to remove him from his home.\nThe more difficult question that arises is whether these delusions \u201cwere of such a character that they could not reasonably be supposed to affect the disposition of his property.\u201d The leading case on the subject is Banks v. Goodfellow[1]. There are two subsequent cases which are of interest as they contain the relevant parts of charges to juries by the President of the Probate Division, Sir James Hannen, who had been a member of the very strong Court that heard the appeal in the Queen\u2019s Bench in Banks v. Goodfellow1. The words italicized are taken from his charge to the jury in Smee v. Smee[2], and the other case to which I have referred is Boughton v. Knight[3]. On page 74 of this latter report, the President quotes and applies the following passage in the judgment of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in Banks v. Goodfellow[4].\nIt is essential to the exercise of such a power (of making a will) that a testator shall understand the nature of the act, and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect, and with a view to the latter object that no disorder of the mind shall poison the affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties, that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property, and bring about a disposal of it, which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made. Here, then, we have the measure of the degree of mental power which should be insisted on. If the human instincts and affections, or the moral sense, become perverted by mental disease, if insane suspicion or aversion take the place of natural affection, if reason and judgment are lost, and the mind becomes a prey to insane delusions calculated to interfere with and disturb its functions, and to lead to a testamentary disposition, due only to their baneful influence, in such a case it is obvious that the condition of testamentary power fails, and that a will made under such circumstances ought not to stand.\nAt page 75, after dealing with the evidence in the case before him he charges the jury:\u2014\nIt is for you to say whether the accumulation of this evidence (for the defendants) has not this effect on your minds that it leads you to the conclusion that, whatever fluctuation there may have been in the condition of Mr. Knight\u2019s mind, for some years before he made this will he had been subject to delusions, especially in reference to the character, the intention, and the motives of his son\u2019s acts; and if you so find, then I must impress upon you that it becomes the duty of the plaintiffs to satisfy you that at the time the testator made the will he was free from those delusions, or free from their influence.\nThe law on this subject is well understood, but difficulties may arise in applying it, as is indicated by the vigorous dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick in Skinner v. Farquharson[5]. There the majority of the members of the Court, who had heard the re\u2011argument, and who were living at the time judgment was given, reversed the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and restored the judgment of the trial judge. The testator in that case had by an earlier will provided for his wife and son. Prior to the execution of the later will which was in question, he, to quote the head-note, \u201chad frequently accused his wife and son of an abominable crime, for which there was no foundation, had banished the son from his house and treated his wife with violence.\u201d By the later will he reduced the provision for his wife and it was held, again quoting the head-note, \u201cthat the provision made by the will for testator\u2019s wife and son, and the appointment of the former as executrix and guardian, were inconsistent with the belief that when it was executed the testator was influenced by the insane delusion that they were guilty of the crime he had imputed to them and the will was therefore valid.\u201d\nAll the circumstances of each case must be considered, and in the present appeal we have come to the conclusion that the delusions were present on October 18th, 1932, the date of the making of the will, and that they did affect the testator\u2019s mind so that he could not rationally take into consideration the interest of his wife.\nThe solicitor who drew the will and who had known the testator for some years testified that he noticed nothing abnormal about the man, but he had never heard of the suggestion in 1928 that the testator be sent to the asylum nor had he heard of the delusions from which the man suffered since that time. It is true that the solicitor\u2019s recollection was that the testator mentioned some family trouble but the reference must have been of a fleeting character since it left no impression upon the mind or memory of the solicitor. The reference which, according to the solicitor, the testator made to his wife\u2019s age, and \u201cthat he wanted to provide a home for her where she would be taken care of in her old days, and he seemed to have it in his own mind that he was making a better provision for her now than he had formerly made for her\u201d does not affect the matter, as that involves a comparison of the testator\u2019s mental condition at the time the previous will was executed and at the date of execution of the will in question; and at the trial the question of the probating of the earlier will in these proceedings was abandoned. The testator was examined by a doctor on October 18th, 1932, but merely for some physical ailment, and while that doctor did not consider that Ouderkirk was incompetent to do business, he did not have present to his mind the question now under investigation. Similarly with Dr. McLeod, who saw Ouderkirk in March and April of 1932. It is true there is evidence called by the propounding executor that several merchants saw him from time to time and considered that he was quite capable of doing business and others called by the executor considered that the man was normal. This negative evidence, however, cannot prevail against the evidence of Dr. Gormley and Eliza McLeod, a daughter of the testator.\nDr. Gormley did not see Ouderkirk the day the will was made and had not seen him possibly for several weeks, but he was quite definite in his opinion as to the permanency of the delusions, and his evidence is not weakened, in our view, by his statement that when Ouderkirk was to undergo an operation the witness suggested that he arrange his affairs; as the doctor admitted, that implied the making of a will, but he stated that he should not have said that to the patient under the circumstances.\nEliza McLeod saw her father at her home in Cornwall on the day in question both before and after the will was executed, and on each occasion her father by his language showed that he was still labouring under the delusions with reference to his wife. It is not remarkable that he did not mention these to the solicitor since he went to the latter\u2019s office with notes for a will prepared by another witness. This witness, Hutt, called by the plaintiff, did not notice anything about the testator different from any other time he had seen him, but did consider strange the provision which the testator desired to be inserted in his will as to the burial of his wife, and also the provision of $5 a year for her. According to the evidence of the widow, the testator had a family plot in the cemetery and no one is buried there except himself, but despite this, the will provides for the burial of the body of the wife in a separate burial plot. This manifestation of the man\u2019s delusion as to his wife is on a par with what is indicated by the evidence of Eliza McLeod and Roy Casselman to the effect that some years before (Casselman fixes it about 1930), Ouderkirk told these two witnesses that after his death his picture in the house was to be taken down so as not to be near the picture of his wife whom he at that time described in terms similar to those used by him on other occasions.\nWe are clearly of opinion that these delusions did affect the mind of the testator to such an extent, and at the relevant time, that he was unable to make the will, and the appeal will, therefore, be allowed and the judgment of the Surrogate Court judge restored. The respondent Bernice Grant Ouderkirk must pay the costs of the appeal to this Court, but we do not interfere with the disposition made by the Court of Appeal for Ontario of the costs of the appeal to that Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Danis & Danis.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.C.

JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA (QUEBEC ADMIRALTY DISTRICT)\nMaritime law\u2014Collision\u2014Evidence of negligence\u2014Damage\u2014Liability\u2014vessel sunk when moored at wharf\u2014Damage\u2014Onus\u2014Findings of trial judge\u2014Assessors\u2014Care and nautical skill.\nThe British cruiser H.M.S. Dragon, in command of the appellant, shortly before 9 o\u2019clock in the morning and in fair weather, when about to enter Victoria Basin in the harbour of the city of Montreal to take up her allotted berth at the cross-wall at the inner end of the basin, collided with and sank the respondents\u2019 oil bunkering steamer Maplebranch which was lying at the time securely moored alongside the steamer New Northland which was docked at the wharf in a section just outside the entrance to the basin, on the north side of the harbour. The oil tanker Maplebranch had received orders to deliver a quantity of oil to the New Northland on the morning of the collision and she proceeded, without previously notifying the Harbour Master\u2019s office in conformity with certain regulations of the Montreal Harbour, to dock the section where the New Northland was moored and tied up alongside it about fifteen minutes before the collision occurred. According to the evidence, the appellant observed the Maplebranch cross over from the entrance to the basin and go alongside the New Northland when he was at a distance estimated by him at about a mile away though at that time he was not able to identify the vessel or to judge the distance of it from the entrance to the basin. It is also common ground that a strong cross current runs diagonally across the entrance of the basin toward the north shore at a speed of from five to six knots. The evidence shows further that a motor vessel, the Saguenay Trader, had arrived in the basin the previous afternoon and docked on the south side, bow towards the west; and, just as the Dragon was approaching the entrance to the basin, the Saguenay Trader was being turned about at her berth by her crew, her stern lines being fast to the pier and she merely drifting round with the wind; and the appellant alleged that, when he observed this motor vessel apparently swinging out across his course, he believed that she was going to get into his way and that he had to stop and reverse the Dragon\u2019s engines and that the cross-current then carried the Dragon over against the Maplebranch with no fault on his part. The action was brought by the respondents, Steamer Colin W. Limited, as registered owner of the steamer Maplebranch, and St. Lawrence Tankers Limited, as beneficial and managing owner or operator of the steamer Maplebranch, and as owner also of the cargo on board her, jointly claiming $100,000 against the appellant as officer commanding H.M.S. Dragon for damages by collision alleged to have been caused solely by the improper and negligent navigation and mismanagement of the Dragon by the appellant.\nHeld, Rinfret and Crocket JJ. dissenting, that the appellant should be held liable. The appellant, having collided with the Maplebranch at her moorings in broad daylight, the onus rested upon him to satisfy the Court that there was no fault upon him which directly caused the collision, and the trial judge has affirmatively found that there was such fault; and where the trial judge, as here, is not only an experienced local judge in Admiralty, but had the assistance of two assessors to advise him upon matters requiring nautical or other professional knowledge and arrived at a conclusion of fact upon conflicting testimony, it would need a very clear case of error for this Court, without the assistance of any assessors, to reverse such a finding.\u2014The position of the Maplebranch has no bearing on the question of the appellant\u2019s liability, for, even if there were some technical breach of one of the Harbour regulations in bunkering the New Northland without first notifying the Harbour Master, that would have no legal consequence because of the fact that the appellant had a full view of the Maplebranch in ample time to avoid a collision with her. There is no place in this case for the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence to the Maplebranch: if there was any negligence, it was remote and antecedent and was not a proximate cause of the collision.\u2014Also, assuming that there was some fault on the part of the vessel Saguenay Trader, if there was fault as well on the part of the appellant, the respondents not being guilty of any contributory negligence would be entitled as a matter of law to recover the whole of their loss from either of the ships that was in fault; and therefore the vital question before the Court was whether there was absence of negligence on the part of the appellant.\nPer Rinfret and Crocket JJ. dissenting.\u2014\nIn the case of a collision in broad daylight between a ship under way and one securely moored and an action brought against the moving ship for the recovery of damages resulting therefrom the defendant is not obliged, in order to absolve himself from liability or blame, to prove that the collision could not have been avoided in any possible way, but only to prove that it could not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary skill and care on his part or on the part of the officers and men, for whose conduct he was responsible, in the particular circumstances in which they were placed. If he clearly proves that the collision was the necessary consequence of the intervention of a third ship in his course and that he and his officers and men were not at fault in the creation of that emergency he fully discharges the onus the law imposes upon him for running into a ship at anchor or securely moored and the defence of inevitable accident is thereby established. The finding of the trial judge that the defendant had not satisfied him that the collision was an inevitable accident was apparently based upon the assumption that the defendant should have foreseen that a vessel at or near the basin the defendant ship was entering might move and that it was his duty to have \u201chis ship in hand to meet any eventuality.\u201d In this he prescribed a higher standard of duty for the defendant than the law warrants. The defendant\u2019s duty was, not to foresee and have his ship in hand to meet and guard against any and every eventuality which might possibly happen, but merely to exercise that degree of care and nautical skill, which is generally looked for in a competent seaman, to avoid such risks as might in the proved circumstances reasonably have been anticipated by him. There is no finding or suggestion, in the trial judgment, of any evidence pointing to any possible negligence on the part of the Dragon other than in following the course it did in approaching the basin, of any failure to keep a sufficient lookout before the Saguenay Trader was first observed across her course within the basin and of any lack of nautical skill respecting the orders to stop her engines and reverse. When these orders were given the evidence clearly shews that the Dragon was face to face with an imminent peril. Unless, therefore, she herself had been guilty of some negligence which contributed to bring that peril about, her commanding and navigating officers, being then in the agony of an imminent collision, could not properly be held to be accountable for any failure to exercise even ordinary care or nautical skill. There was no evidence upon which it could properly be found that there was any prior negligence upon their part which contributed to bring about the emergency. In these circumstances the Dragon should have been held blameless. The City of Peking Case (6 Asp. 396) disc.\nAPPEAL from the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, P. Demers J., maintaining an action brought by the respondents jointly claiming the sum of $100,000 against the appellant as officer commanding H.M.S. Dragon for damage by collision, the appellant being condemned to pay the damages sustained by the respondents, the same to be assessed upon a reference to the registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada assisted by merchants.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated fully in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. A. Campbell K.C., John Kerry K.C. and R. C. Harvey-Jellie for the appellant.\nR. C. Holden K.C. and A. D. P. Heeney for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Cannon and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014In broad daylight and in fair weather the British cruiser H.M.S. Dragon in command of the appellant, when about to enter what is known as the Market (or Victoria) Basin in the harbour of the city of Montreal to take up her allotted berth at the cross-wall at the inner end of the basin, collided with and sank the respondents\u2019 oil bunkering steamer Maplebranch which was lying at the time securely moored alongside the steamer New Northland which was docked at the wharf in section 23 just outside the entrance to the basin. The Dragon had a length of 470 feet and a beam of 41 feet and at the time of the collision was inbound from the city of Quebec. It seems unfortunate that the Master of the Montreal Harbour should have allotted to the British cruiser such an inconvenient berth to be reached through a comparatively narrow entrance, and while the Harbour Commission is not a party to this action and has not been called upon to justify the designation of the particular berth, it is a little difficult to refrain from comment upon what appears to have been a most inappropriate location for the Dragon. Just at the entrance to the basin, the Dragon\u2019s starboard side, at a point about 100 feet from her stern, struck the starboard side of the Maplebranch and the Dragon\u2019s starboard propeller cut into the Maplebranch and she sank. The Maplebranch had a length of approximately 232 feet and a beam of 35.5 feet. This action by the owners of the Maplebranch (respondents) is to recover from the Officer Commanding the Dragon (appellant) the damages sustained by them and under the circumstances it plainly rested upon the appellant to satisfy the Court that there was no negligence on his part. In the City of Peking case[1], the Judicial Committee laid down the rule very definitely that the fact of a vessel under steam colliding with a ship at her moorings in daylight is prima facie evidence of fault and her owners cannot escape liability except by proving that a competent officer could not have averted the collision by the exercise of ordinary care and skill.\nCounsel for the appellant, in endeavouring to support the plea of inevitable accident, complained of the conduct of the Maplebranch itself and also of the conduct of a motor schooner, the Saguenay Trader, which was at the time of the accident in course of being turned about at her berth within the harbour.\nDealing firstly then with the charges against the Maplebranch. It is contended that under certain regulations of the Montreal Harbour she was not entitled to be lying alongside the New Northland and that her presence there was an impediment to the Dragon entering the basin to take her allotted berth. But the evidence is clear that the appellant observed the Maplebranch cross over from the entrance to the basin and go alongside the New Northland when he was at a distance estimated by him at about a mile away though at that time he was not able to identify the vessel or to judge the distance of it from the entrance to the basin. The appellant admits that when he was about 200 or 300 yards below the Maplebranch he was able to estimate her position and if he had thought then that there was any danger to the Maplebranch he could have stopped earlier than he did. He went on, thinking he could go in successfully with the Maplebranch where she was. The Navigating Officer of the Dragon was asked how the Maplebranch bore at the time the engines of the Dragon were stopped.\nQ. You were not worrying at all about the Maplebranch at that stage?\nA. Not at that stage. Q. But for this schooner (i.e., the Saguenay Trader) you think the Maplebranch would not have interfered with your entry?\nA. I am quite certain of it.\nThe position of the Maplebranch has no bearing on the question of the appellant\u2019s liability for even if there were some technical breach of one the Harbour regulations in bunkering the New Northland without first notifying the Harbour Master, that would have no legal consequence because of the fact that the appellant had a full view of the Maplebranch in ample time to avoid a collision with her. In Cayzer, Irvine & Co. v. Carron Company[2], the House of Lords had to consider an action brought in the Admiralty Division in respect of a collision off Blackwall Point. The appellants\u2019 steamship, the Clan Sinclair, had come out of the South West India Dock on the north shore of the Thames nearly opposite the curve of Blackwall Point about 1.30 p.m. on the 9th of March, 1883, and proceeded down river against the tide under her own steam and with a tug attached, at about three ta four knots through the water. The respondents\u2019 vessel, the Margaret, was at the same time steaming up the river with the tide at from five to six knots over the ground. The Court of Appeal had held that upon the true construction of Rule 23 of the Thames Rules the Clan Sinclair had broken the rule in not easing so as to prevent herself from proceeding lower down the river than was necessary, when she first ought to have seen the Margaret, and held that both vessels were to blame. The House of Lords reversed the order of the Court of Appeal on the ground that even assuming, but without deciding, that the construction put by the Court of Appeal on Rule 23 was correct and that the Clan Sinclair had transgressed that rule, yet such transgression was not the cause of the collision; that ordinary care on the part of the Margaret would have enabled her to avoid the collision, and that she alone was to blame. I quote the words of Lord Blackburn at p. 883:\nThen it is said that the collision was owing to the Clan Sinclair being where it was. Undoubtedly in one sense that is so. If the Clan Sinclair had been some hundred yards higher up the river, the fact which made it a matter of rashness for the Margaret to run where it did run would not have existed. But that is not a sufficient ground for saying that the fact of the Clan Sinclair being there was the cause of the accident. The Clan Sinclair would not have been there at the time when it was there if it had not been that the vessel did not ease and wait so soon perhaps as it ought to have done; but that was not the cause of the accident, but that the Margaret, knowing where the Clan Sinclair was, attempted to pass between it and the Zephyr where there was not sufficient room.\nUndoubtedly the Maplebranch would not have been sunk had she not been where she was but whether she was rightly or wrongly there, having regard to the local regulations of the Montreal Harbour, the appellant had full view of her in broad daylight and there is no place in this case for the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence to the Maplebranch. If there was any negligence, it was remote and antecedent and was not a proximate cause of the collision.\nTurning now to the charges against the motor schooner, the Saguenay Trader, the owners of which are not parties to the action, but whose conduct, the appellant contends, was the direct and sole cause of the unfortunate occurrence. The Saguenay Trader was a small motor schooner 103 feet long. At all material times she was tied at her regular allotted berth within the basin, at the Victoria Pier (which forms the south side of the basin), starting at a point about 75 feet from the end of the pier. As the Dragon was approaching the entrance to the basin this schooner was being turned about at her berth by her crew; her stern lines were fast to the pier and she merely drifted round with the wind, the turning operation taking about ten or twelve minutes. The defence of the appellant is that to avoid striking the schooner it became suddenly necessary for him to stop and reverse the Dragon\u2019s engines and that a cross current then carried the Dragon over against the Maplebranch and that there was no fault on his part; in other words, that it was an inevitable accident. The trial judge said,\nThere is no question that if the Saguenay Trader had not started to turn when the Dragon was approaching the basin there would have been no accident to anybody.\nCounsel for the appellant very naturally seized upon that sentence in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge and sought to put the entire blame upon the Saguenay Trader. It may be that if the Saguenay Trader had not been turning round at her berth at the time the Dragon was about to enter the basin, it would not have been necessary for the appellant to stop and reverse the engines of the Dragon when he did, but that observation does not carry us any distance in determining what was the proximate cause of the damage to the Maplebranch. I cannot find that the Saguenay Trader was committing any wrongful act in turning round at her berth or that she in any way contravened Regulation 28 of the Harbour regulations which provides that\nThe master or person in charge of any vessel wishing to move from one berth to another in the harbour must first obtain permission from the Harbour Master.\nThe Saguenay Trader was not moving from one berth to another. The Harbour Master had given no orders or directions to the Saguenay Trader or to any of the other boats that were lying in the harbour with respect to the arrival of the Dragon. The Saguenay Trader had been allowed to come in and go out and to turn on arrival or departure without permission each time from the Harbour Master and so far as the appellant knew (he had received no assurance that none of the boats in or around the basin would be moving about) the Saguenay Trader might have been merely departing on a voyage. But assuming that there was some fault on the part of the Saguenay Trader, though I cannot find any, if there was fault as well on the part of the appellant as on the part of the Saguenay Trader, the respondents, not being guilty of any contributary negligence, would be entitled as a matter of law to recover the whole of their loss from either of the ships that was in fault. The Devonshire[3]. The vital question before us therefore is whether there was absence of negligence on the part of the appellant. It cannot properly be said, it seems to me upon the evidence in this case, that the appellant was suddenly put in the agony of a collision. The movement of any one of the several boats that were in or about the entrance to the basin was something to be reasonably anticipated by the appellant and with respect to which, having regard to the neck of the bottle as it were through which he had to pass, he should have had his ship under control to meet.\nWithin the basin beside the Saguenay Trader were the motor schooner Z\u00e9non C. (85 feet long), lying just west of the Saguenay Trader on the south side, and, on the north side, the Tadoussac (350 feet long) and the Richelieu, another large steamer. Just outside the basin, in section 23 of the wharf, stood the New Northland (287 feet long with a 47-foot beam) and alongside her the Maplebranch. Somewhat farther down the wharf was H.M.S. Dundee. The trial judge specifically found that the movement of the Saguenay Trader was \u201csomething unexpected by the Dragon, but in the opinion of the Court it was one of those eventualities a mariner should guard himself against.\u201d\nHaving collided with the Maplebranch in broad daylight it rested upon the appellant to satisfy the Court that there was no fault on his part which, either alone or in common with some fault on the part of the Saguenay Trader, directly caused the collision. It is said that under all the circumstances it is a hardship to hold the appellant liable but it would be an equal hardship to the owners of the Maplebranch and her cargo if sympathy for the appellant were to enter into the determination of the action. The question is whether or not the appellant has discharged the onus that lay upon him to establish that he was not guilty of what the law regards as negligence. The learned trial judge has had much experience as the local Judge in Admiralty at Montreal and he had the advantage of two assessors appointed under the provisions of Rule 112 of the General Rules and Orders regulating the practice and procedure in admiralty cases in the Exchequer Court of Canada. It is plain that the trial judge decided the matter, as he was bound to do, in accordance with his own opinion as to the law and the merits, though he adopted, as he was entitled to adopt, the advice of the assessors upon those phases of the action which required nautical knowledge and practical seamanship. Such a judgment ought to be given great weight by an appellate court and we ought not to interfere with it unless upon our own examination of the evidence, unassisted as we are by assessors, we are led to an irresistible conclusion that there is manifest error in the judgment. Counsel for the appellant in their very able and exhaustive argument before us have failed to satisfy me that there was no fault directly causing the damage, on the part of the appellant. The trial judge went farther and found affirmatively that there was fault on the part of the appellant. We may conveniently examine now the evidence upon which the learned trial judge undoubtedly rested his finding of fault. West, the Navigating Officer of the Dragon, made a black line on exhibit D-1 to indicate the course which according to him the Dragon followed from the time she went under Harbour Bridge up to the time her engines were stopped. If this course was followed, the Dragon did not alter to starboard until she had reached a point about opposite the Maplebranch and at least three or four hundred feet out in the river from the north shore. On the same chart, exhibit D-1, Captain Lacouture of the Maplebranch indicated in blue pencil the course which the Dragon appeared to him to have taken. Captain Lacouture said that when he first noticed the Dragon altering her course she was about 1,000 feet below the entrance to the basin; he was standing on the bridge of the Maplebranch watching the Dragon approaching. He said that he only saw the Dragon broadside, indicating that the Dragon had altered her course at that time to starboard, and that when the bow of the Dragon passed the bridge of the Maplebranch the distance between the Maplebranch and the bow of the Dragon was only about 60 to 65 feet. At that time the Dragon was about parallel to the Maplebranch. Symons, the Harbour Master of Montreal, when asked from his knowledge of the current, if the Dragon coming in followed \u201canything like the course\u201d marked with the blue pencil could she expect to get safely into the basin, said that it all depended on the speed she was travelling, that it is not the usual course for a long ship, it might do for a small vessel 100 or 150 feet long, but that a long vessel should be farther out as she passed the wharf where the New Northland was moored and that if a long ship got as close to the shore as indicated by the blue pencil he would expect her to have a lot of difficulty getting in, unless she could move very fast, and in any event the current would be very much inclined to swing her down on the moored ships. The Dragon\u2019s records and the evidence of the appellant and of West, the Navigating Officer, indicate that the alteration to starboard was made by the Dragon at 0842. The entry in the Navigating Officer\u2019s note-book reads,\u2014\n0842\nAltered course to starboard, 30 degrees.\nWest stated that while he thought he used only 10 degrees of starboard helm, the ship actually turned 30 degrees. The appellant himself, at the trial, said I had to use 30 degrees of wheel to get a swing quickly because the current was on my starboard bow. She hung rather, and I started with 15, and told the Navigating Officer to give her more, and he gave her 30 degrees of wheel to bring her around.\nAnd he said that it was about 1,000 to 1,200 feet, from the end of the pier, when he altered the course to starboard, and West had testified that they starboarded about 1,200 feet below the pier. But when the Dragon altered her course to port at 0839 to steer on buoy 201-M she was almost 1,000 feet below the Harbour Bridge, as shown by chart exhibit D-9. She was making 11\u00bd knots through the water and continued on this course for only three minutes, until 0842, when she altered the 30 degrees to starboard and continued on this new course for a similar period of three minutes until 0845 when her engines were reversed and the helm put hard aport.\nThe respondents\u2019 contention at the trial was that the alteration to starboard was a good deal farther down the river than the course plotted on chart exhibit D-9 indicates and that the Dragon turned in at a point down the river which brought her in close to the shore too soon. There was considerable evidence at the trial by eye-witnesses to the accident that the Dragon was too close to the shore and was already in a dangerous position while she was still considerably below the Maplebranch. Captain Hatfield was standing on the port side of the New Northland, at the rail, and in his judgment the Dragon swung \u201ca little bit too sharply.\u201d He did not particularly notice the Dragon until her bow was half her length astern the New Northland. Now the New Northland was between 450 and 475 feet below the Victoria Pier and the length of the New Northland herself was 287 feet and half the Dragon\u2019s length was 235 feet, making in all about 1,000 feet that the bow of the Dragon was below the pier at the time Captain Hatfield says he first saw her. O\u2019Hearn, 3rd Officer of the New Northland, was near her stern where he had gone to dip the colours. He testified that when the Dragon was about half her length below the stern of the New Northland she was only 80 or 90 feet outside that ship. He had never seen a ship so close to the north side when trying to enter the basin and he testified that the Dragon was never out in the position shown on the sketch filed by the appellant as exhibit D-2. Bouchard, 2nd Officer of the New Northland, testified that he thought there was danger when he first saw the Dragon about 300 feet below the New Northland and that the Dragon was in opposite the basin and was not in the position shown on the appellant\u2019s sketch, exhibit D-2. Le Calvez, a waiter on the Tadoussac, testified that when passing the Dundee (which was moored below the New Northland) the Dragon was only 40 or 50 feet out from her and that when about three of her own lengths below the Clock Tower at the end of the pier, the Dragon \u201ctook an inward course into the basin.\u201d While the witness may not be exact in his estimate of the distances, he placed the Dragon dangerously close to the north shore and not out in the river as indicated by the course marked by West on the chart exhibit D-1. Sioui, another waiter on the Tadoussac, testified that when the Dragon was at least a length below the Maplebranch he realized that there might be a collision and that as the Dragon came on, her bow was between 50 and 60 feet from the Maplebranch and that she was never out opposite the pier as indicated on the appellant\u2019s sketch, exhibit D-2. Murphy, who was on the top deck of the New Northland, saw the Dragon when she was around shed 24, just below the Dundee, and he estimated that she was then probably 150 or 200 feet from the Dundee coming toward the basin. Captain Gagnon from the deck of the Saguenay Trader saw the Dragon when she was a little below the New Northland. He said she was coming fast and was heading for about the middle of the basin, and he could see only her port side. The effect of Gagnon\u2019s evidence is that the Dragon was up opposite the entrance to the basin while still below the New Northland and was never out opposite the end of Victoria Pier and close to it, as the appellant contends. There was substantial evidence that when the Dragon stopped and reversed her engines she was already near the north shore and practically on top of the Maplebranch. Against all this evidence, the appellant and his Navigating Officer West said that the Dragon took the outer course as indicated generally by the black line on sketch exhibit D-1.\nUpon this conflicting testimony the trial judge came to the conclusion that the course \u201cat first\u201d followed by the Dragon was more as indicated by the black line than by the blue line on exhibit D-1 but that she did not follow that course throughout and \u201cturned too early, or, if you prefer, too sharply.\u201d The language is unfortunately somewhat loose but I think indicates plainly that in the judgment of the Court the proper course to have taken was the course indicated throughout by the black line and that in point of fact the appellant did not keep to that course and that his failure to do so led him into difficulty when confronted with the movement of the Saguenay Trader and directly caused the collision of the Dragon with the Maplebranch. It is common ground that there is calm water in the basin but that a strong current runs diagonally across the entrance of the basin toward the north shore at a speed of from five to six knots. \u201cFor this reason,\u201d as counsel for the appellant very frankly state in their factum, \u201cvessels approaching the basin must steer well to port and far out from the north shore.\u201d Counsel for the appellant further state in their factum that \u201cThe earlier a vessel turns in, the sooner will the navigator be able to perceive anything in his course; but to turn too early means that the current will carry the ship to the north shore before it can safely cross it.\u201d There is really no difficulty in appreciating the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Dragon \u201cturned too early, or, if you prefer, too sharply.\u201d\nWhile I think the onus lay throughout the case upon the appellant to satisfy the Court that there was no fault upon him which directly caused the collision, the learned judge has affirmatively found that there was such fault; and where the trial judge, as here, is not only an experienced local Judge in Admiralty but had the assistance of two assessors to advise him upon matters requiring nautical or other professional knowledge and arrived at a conclusion of fact upon conflicting testimony, it would need a very clear case of error for this Court, without the assistance of any assessors, to reverse such a finding.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The question of liability for the cargo is open on the reference directed to be had but if there is any doubt on that point, as suggested during the argument, the order of this Court may make it plain. One of the respondents, the steamer Colin W. Limited, was the registered owner of the Maplebranch but its co-plaintiff, St. Lawrence Tankers Limited, was the beneficial owner as well as the owner of the cargo laden on board her. The former company may have been a necessary and proper party to the action but the recovery of judgment should have been limited to the latter company, and the judgment at the trial may be corrected if counsel for the appellant think it necessary.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This appeal comes to us directly from a decision of the Local Judge in Admiralty for the district of Quebec (Mr. Justice P. Demers) in an action brought by the respondents, Steamer Colin W. Limited, as registered owner of the Str. Maplebranch, and St. Lawrence Tankers Limited, as beneficial and managing owner or operator of said Str. Maplebranch, and as owner also of the cargo laden on board her, jointly claiming $100,000 against the defendant as Officer Commanding H.M.S. Dragon, for damage by collision alleged to have been caused solely by the improper and negligent navigation and mismanagement of the Dragon by the defendant.\nThe collision occurred in the Harbour of Montreal on Monday, August 13, 1934, shortly before 9 o\u2019clock a.m., while the Maplebranch was lying tied up alongside the Str. New Northland on the north side of the harbour and while the Dragon, upbound from Quebec, was about entering Market Basin to dock at its western wall, where her Commanding Officer had been notified by the Harbour Master she was to dock. The Maplebranch sank soon afterwards as a result of the collision.\nThe Harbour Master\u2019s office had been informed by wireless through H.M.S. Dundee, which was docked below the New Northland, on Saturday afternoon that the H.M.S Dragon would arrive at 9 o\u2019clock on Monday morning, but this information was not communicated to any of the vessels moored in or about the basin, though steps were taken to see that the west wall was clear to receive the warship on her arrival.\nThe Maplebranch was a twin screw oil tanker of 1,649 registered tonnage, 238 feet long, with a beam of 35 feet 6 inches. Having received orders to deliver a quantity of oil to the New Northland on the morning of August 13, she proceeded without previously notifying the Harbour Master\u2019s office from the Racine wharf to dock section 23, where the New Northland was moored, and tied up alongside the last named steamer only ten or fifteen minutes before the collision occurred. The beams of the two vessels thus lying side by side extended 82.8 feet into the harbour from the wall of the dock and this at a point only a few hundred feet below the entrance to the basin.\nIt appears that the Commanding Officer of the H.M.S.. Dragon, when at a distance he estimated to be about a mile east of the Market Basin, had observed the Maplebranch cross over from the entrance to the basin and come alongside the New Northland, though he was not then able to identify either vessel or in a position to judge the distance of the two vessels from the entrance of the basin, according to her case. Just before the Dragon got to the Harbour Bridge she altered her course to port, steering on gas buoy 201, on the south side of the ship channel, and continued in that direction until she reached a position at a distance variously estimated as from 1,000 to 1,500 feet from the east end of Victoria Pier, the inside northerly wall of which forms the southerly side wall of Market Basin. At this point, her case was, the defendant altered her course to starboard and steered for the end of Victoria Pier. It should here be explained that a cross current sweeps across the basin entrance in a northeasterly direction upon dock sections 23 and 24. Having been advised by the pilot, who had been assigned to the ship at Quebec for the Montreal trip, that this current was a six-knot current, the defendant in approaching the basin increased his speed from 87 to 100 revolutions which, it seems, means 11\u00bd knots through the water and about 8 to 8\u00bd over the ground. When the Dragon got within 500 or 600 feet of the line of the entrance to the basin or about half way from the point at which she had altered her course to starboard the current began to swing the vessel sideways towards the entrance of the basin, which measures 312 feet, as the defendant had anticipated it would, and then, when the bow of the warship was pointing towards the northeasterly corner of Victoria Pier, the defendant, according to his case, for the first time saw over that point of the pier a vessel moving within the basin not far from the entrance. As the Dragon approached the entrance of the basin, the defendant, who was in command of the ship and on the bridge with his navigating officer, another Lieutenant-Commander, a number of signalmen and the pilot\u2014the latter on the port side of the platform\u2014was heading his ship, on account of the cross current, outside the basin, and could not see any of the vessels\u2014it seems there were three of them\u2014which were moored on the south side of the basin, these being hidden from his view by the clock tower and sheds on the pier. He was steering to port to allow for the set of the current. He could see, however, the vessels which were moored along the north side of the basin. One of these was the Tadoussac, 350 feet long with a beam of about 70 feet, a passenger steamer of the Canada Steamships Line, which, it seems, had docked earlier in the morning, partly within and partly without the entrance to the basin, the stern of the latter being about 65 feet west of the bow of the New Northland. Some distance west the Richelieu, another passenger of the Canada Steamships Line, lay along the nort wall of the basin. The vessel, which the defendant saw over the pier moving in the basin from the position indicated, turned out to be the Saguenay Trader, a motor vessel, 103 feet long. It had arrived in the basin the previous afternoon and docked on the south side, bow towards the west, in a space of 175 feet, which had been marked off and allotted by the Harbour Master for the Verrault Shipping Co., commencing at a point about 75 feet from the eastern end of the pier.\nIt seems that when the Dragon altered her course to starboard at 8.42 a.m. while south and east of Victoria Pier the Saguenay Trader was turning around at her berth for the purpose of more conveniently discharging some cargo on the dock. This movement was made without giving any notification to the Harbour Master or the Harbour Master\u2019s office and in violation, as both the Harbour Master and the Dock Master alleged, of the regulations governing the movement of ships in the harbour.\nThe result was that when the Dragon got closer to the basin entrance with the cross current gradually swinging her into a position paralleling or nearly paralleling the north wall of the basin the defendant observed this motor vessel swinging out across his course and believed that she was going to get into his way. The Chief Yeoman of the Dragon said that when he first saw the motor vessel it was about at an angle of 45 degrees from the wharf and swinging out very quickly as the Dragon was approaching. Confronted with this emergency when, as he estimated, the Dragon was at a point approximately 150 to 200 yards from the end of Victoria Pier the defendant stopped his engines and immediately afterwards\u2014the navigating officer says 12 or 15 seconds later\u2014ordered full speed astern, and then hard aport. The warship moved on towards the basin at a reduced speed. Her bows passed into the still water of the basin but her stern, still in the cross current, was swung over while the ship was still moving forward slowly, so that her starboard propeller, which was situated about 100 feet forward of the extreme end of the stern, caught the Maplebranch and ripped some of the plates off her hull. \u201cOwing to the fact,\u201d the officer commanding explained, \u201cthat I had to pull the ship up while she was still in the current instead of in the still water in the basin the current caught my stern and swung it over so that it hit the Maplebranch.\u201d\nThe Dragon, after hitting the Maplebranch, continued to move forward in the basin and passed the Saguenay Trader by about 15 or 20 feet. In executing her turning movement the Saguenay Trader did not use its own power but relied entirely upon the force of the wind from the west to turn her round while lines from her stern held her to the wharf, so that in turning she must at one time have had her stem projected into the basin at least 103 feet. The Dragon herself was 470 feet long with a beam of 41 feet.\nBy consent of counsel all evidence made at the formal investigation of the collision before the Wreck Commissioner in August, 1934, was made part of the trial record in the Admiralty Court subject to the right of the parties to recall the same witnesses or to call new witnesses in their discretion. In pursuance of this agreement the Commanding Officer and the Navigating Officer of the Dragon were recalled and gave evidence in the Admiralty Court before the learned trial judge and his assessors, supplementing in some particulars that which they had previously given before the Wreck Commissioner. Only two other witnesses gave evidence in the presence of the trial judge, one of whom, a photographer, merely identified a photograph which had been produced at the Enquete. The other (Sioui) was a waiter on the Tadousac, who gave an account of what he had seen from the stern of the main deck of that ship. So that the trial was one in which the learned judge with the exceptions just indicated had not the advantage of seeing the witnesses as they gave the evidence upon which he decided the case, which I think in a case of such importance as this was unfortunate.\nHis Lordship held that the principal issue was as to whether the defendant had proved that the collision was an inevitable accident, and that the defendant had not satisfied him that it was. He therefore ordered judgment for the plaintiffs and referred the case to the Registrar, assisted by merchants, for the assessment of damages.\nI have already summarized the essential facts as they appear from the evidence of the defendant, his navigating officer and other witnesses, which I have thought it well to do at the outset in order to get a clear picture of the collision as explained from the defendant\u2019s standpoint.\nOn the part of the plaintiffs it was sought to shew that the Dragon, after passing under the Harbour Bridge, which, it seems, is 3,300 feet below the easterly line of Victoria Pier, altered her course to the north in the middle of the ship channel and then gradually drew in towards the Dundee and the Maplebranch until she got in a position less than 100 feet out from these vessels; one witness put it as low as 40 feet out from the side of the Maplebranch It is clear from the learned trial judge\u2019s reasons that he did not accept this evidence, for he expressly held that the evidence shewed that the line at first followed by the Dragon was more as indicated by the defendant and his witnesses, though stating that the court was of the opinion, as were also the assessors, \u201cthat the Dragon turned too early, or if you prefer, too sharply.\u201d\nIt was sought also by the plaintiffs to prove that the Saguenay Trader had completed her turning movement in the basin and was lying alongside the wharf again at the time the Dragon altered her course to starboard. This evidence the learned trial judge seems to have rejected also, for he states that there was\nno question that if the Saguenay Trader had not started to turn when the Dragon was approaching the basin there would have been no accident to anybody.\nThere is no doubt there is a well recognized rule in the Admiralty Courts of Great Britain as well as of Canada that the fact of a ship under way running in broad daylight into a ship at anchor or securely moored, as the learned trial judge found the Maplebranch was here, creates a presumption that the collision was caused by the negligence of the moving ship. This presumption is, of course, not absolute, but is one which can only be effectually rebutted by clear proof that the collision was not wholly or in part so caused, that is to say, by clear proof that there was no negligence on the part of the moving ship, which caused or materially contributed to cause the collision sued for, or in other words, that the collision could not possibly have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care and ordinary nautical skill on the part of the moving ship. If it could not have been so avoided it is, so far as the moving ship is concerned, \u201can inevitable accident\u201d within the true meaning of that expression so often used in maritime law. If it could have been so avoided, the defence fails. That, I apprehend, is the clear result of the authorities on the question of the proof of inevitable accident, as now generally recognized. See The Batavier[4]; The Marpesia[5]; The Sisters[6]; The Annot Lyle[7]; The Merchant Prince[8]; The Schwan and The Albans[9]; The Steel Scientist)[10]; The Clarissa Radcliffe[11].\nThe law as it affects the adequacy of proof of inevitable accident is perhaps most concisely summed up in the following passage from the judgment of Dr. Lushington in The Thomas Powell v. The Cuba[12].\nTo constitute an inevitable accident it was necessary that the occurrence should have taken place in such a manner as not to have been capable of being prevented by ordinary skill and ordinary diligence. We were not to expect extraordinary skill or extraordinary diligence, but that degree of skill and that degree of diligence which is generally to be found in persons who discharge their duty.\nWhether the person sued exercised such skill and care manifestly can only be determined on a full consideration of all the conditions and circumstances in which he found himself, as in any action based on negligence. It must be borne in mind in all cases, whether the defendant be charged with negligence causing a collision with a ship at anchor or a collision with a ship under way, that he is not obliged, in order to absolve himself from liability or blame, to prove that the collision could not have been avoided in any possible way, but only to prove that it could not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary skill and care on his part or on the part of the officers and men, for whose conduct he was responsible, in the particular circumstances in which they were placed. If a defendant clearly proves that the collision sued for was the necessary consequence of the intervention of a third ship in his course and that he was not at fault in the creation of that emergency he fully discharges the onus the law imposes upon him for running into a ship at anchor. Proof by a preponderance of evidence, as in all civil actions, is all that is necessary to establish the defence of inevitable accident in such a case.\nWith all respect it seems to me from my study of the trial judgment and of the evidence that the learned judge prescribed for the defendant a higher standard of duty than the law warrants. I have already quoted two of His Lordship\u2019s findings, viz.: \u201cthat the Dragon turned too early or, if you prefer, too sharply,\u201d and that \u201cif the Saguenay Trader had not started to turn when the Dragon was approaching the basin there would have been no accident to anybody.\u201d\nAs to the first of these findings its meaning is not clear in itself, but His Lordship explains it in the two following paragraphs:\nI am told by my assessor that the proper way of entering that basin on account of a current running from Victoria Pier towards section 23 of the wharf is to keep a course well southwest of the extremity of Victoria wharf,\u2014at a certain moment, a few hundred feet off this point, to proceed slowly in the current until she is in proper position to enter the basin. This permits the ship to thus attain safely the dead water of the basin. Of course, if you turn too sharply, on acount of the current you must maintain the speed otherwise you are carried by the current against the wharf, but the entrance to be safely executed must be as I have said, and diagonal.\nIf the manoeuvre had been as I have said, the defendant would have got his ship in hand to meet any eventuality. By taking the other course, there was the risk of an intervening ship in the basin.\nThese two paragraphs no doubt shew that His Lordship adopted the opinion of his assessor (the record states there were two assessors and doubtless His Lordship meant both of them) as the proper course to enter the basin, but that does not mean that there was any negligence on the part of the Dragon in following the course it actually did follow in approaching the basin, or that, if there were any failure to exercise ordinary skill in not following the suggested course, such failure was the direct cause of her hitting the Maplebranch.\nIt is unfortunate that there is no record of the precise questions which were submitted to the assessors for their advice and no other record of their advice than that contained in the paragraph of the judgment above quoted, for, as it is there stated, it is not of a very clear or definite character. Whether it was intended to indicate the proper way for a vessel of the Dragon\u2019s length and navigating characteristics to approach and enter the basin or the proper way for all vessels, regardless of their size, to approach and enter, it is difficult to say, but if it was intended to lay down a course for all vessels alike, and in all conditions of wind and weather, it is clear from the evidence that it is not the course which has been usually followed. As to keeping a course well southwest of Victoria Pier, that is precisely what the evidence shews the Dragon did until she was within a distance, according to the defendant, of 1,000 or 1,200 feet. Nothing is said about a vessel changing her course from well southwest of the extremity of Victoria Pier, but at a certain moment, a few hundred feet off this point, it is said she is to proceed slowly in the current until she is in a proper position to enter the basin. There must, however, obviously be some turning to starboard from such a course, if a vessel is to enter a basin on the north shore of the river before she can proceed slowly in such a cross current as has been described.\nI confess I cannot understand just what is meant by the finding in the preceding paragraph that the Dragon \u201cturned too early or, if you prefer, too sharply,\u201d for it seems to me that the farther west she proceeded on her course southwest of Victoria Pier, the more sharply she would have to starboard into the cross current, while the farther east she was, i.e. the sooner she turned to approach the entrance to the basin, the less sharp would be her turning angle. Be this as it may, we are told, presumably on the advice of the assessors: \u201cOf course, if you turn too sharply, on account of the current you must maintain the speed, otherwise you are carried by the current against the wharf, but the entrance to be safely executed must be, as I have said, and diagonal.\u201d I take this to mean that if a vessel does not follow the course first suggested and proceed slowly in the current until she is in a proper position to enter the basin, but instead turns more sharply into the cross current she must maintain her speed to avoid being carried against the wharf, and enter the basin diagonally, heading towards the northwest. My greatest difficulty with the assessors\u2019 opinion is to understand how a vessel, which simply proceeds slowly in the current from a course well southwest of Victoria Pier, is less likely to be carried by the cross current against the wharf or a ship moored there than if she turns sharply into the cross current and maintains her speed.\nWhatever the suggestion may be, however, it cannot well be held that the failure to precisely follow one course in preference to the other even points to the possibility of negligence causing the collision with the Maplebranch, when the trial judge has expressly found that had it not been for the action of the Saguenay Trader there would have been no accident to anybody. This last mentioned finding can mean nothing else than that, had it not been for the intervention of the third ship, the Dragon would have passed safely into the basin on the course she was following, and no other conclusion in that regard is in my opinion reasonably possible on the evidence. In any event there is nothing in connection with the finding regarding the too early or too sharp turning of the Dragon to shew that any consideration was given either by the assessors or the learned trial judge to her unusual length or her navigating characteristics, with which her navigating officers were so familiar, or to any other facts or circumstances, which might affect the question as to whether ordinary care and skill were exercised in adopting the course she did.\nIt was strongly urged in behalf of the defendant that the finding as to the too sharp turning should in any case be disregarded for the reason that it was not even suggested on the trial and that the defendant accordingly had no opportunity of answering it. It is true that paragraphs 15 and 16 of the statement of claim allege that the defendant altered his course to starboard too soon and that he directed his ship too much to starboard and attempted to bring her up the harbour too close to the north shore, but this claim had reference, I think, clearly to the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to prove that she turned to starboard at a point indicated by the captain of the Maplebranch on exhibit D-1 and followed the course marked by him in blue. The bulk of the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was directed to this feature of the case, but was rejected by the trial judge, and, so far as I can discover, attention was not anywhere called to any specific negligence in turning either too soon or too sharply from the course the Dragon was following well southwest of the extremity of Victoria Pier at the point where the evidence shews he did turn to starboard to make his entrance to the basin. This fact itself, it seems to me, affords a perfectly sound basis of objection to the learned trial judge\u2019s finding upon that point, even if there were no other. See Dominion Bridge Co. v. Str. Philip J. Dodge.[13] It is quite apparent to me, however, from the judgment itself that the true explanation of His Lordship\u2019s essential finding that the defendant had not satisfied him that the collision was an inevitable accident, lies in the fact that the learned judge assumed that the defendant should have foreseen \u201cthat a vessel at or near that basin might move\u201d and that it was his duty to get \u201chis ship in hand to meet any eventuality.\u201d \u201cBy taking the other course\u201d (i.e., I assume, the first one suggested by the assessors) His Lordship says \u201cthere was the risk of an intervening ship in the basin,\u201d and later he adds:\nOf course, this movement of the Saguenay Trader was something unexpected by the Dragon but in the opinion of the Court it was one of those eventualities a mariner should guard himself against.\nIt is especially in respect of these last mentioned findings that I think His Lordship misdirected himself as to the extent of the defendant\u2019s duty. The defendant\u2019s duty, as I conceive it under the law, was, not to foresee and have his ship in hand to meet and guard against any and every eventuality which might possibly happen, but merely to exercise that degree of care and nautical skill, which is generally looked for in a competent seaman, to avoid such risks as might in the proved circumstances reasonably have been anticipated by him.\nWe have before us unquestioned proof that the Harbour authorities had notified the defendant that the west wall of the basin would be reserved for the docking of the Dragon on her arrival and that the defendant had notified them of the precise hour his ship would arrive. Indeed the learned trial judge not only points this out at the outset of his judgment, but deprecates the omission of the Harbour authorities to notify the ships at or near the basin that the Dragon was to arrive at 9 o\u2019clock, and plainly states that this omission \u201cexplains this unfortunate collision.\u201d He says:\nThe defendant evidently expected that, as a matter of courtesy, the wharf authorities would have given such a notification and would have paid attention to stop all movements of the ships but he had not been told so, and in the opinion of the Court, he should have foreseen that a vessel at or near that basin might move. The fact is that before he reached Jacques Cartier bridge, he saw the movements of the Maplebranch.\nIt seems to me that the mere fact that the defendant had not been told that the Harbour authorities had actually done what it so obviously was their duty to do, cannot well be held to make it negligence for the defendant to assume that the Harbour authorities had performed their duty and that as a consequence no ships would be allowed to move in or about the entrance to the basin that might foul or obstruct the course of so long a ship in entering to dock at the berth which had been assigned to her.\nAs to the Maplebranch herself, the suing ship, it is conclusively shewn that in taking up her position alongside the New Northland without permission from the Harbour Master\u2019s office and in violation, as both the Harbour Master and the Dock Master affirmed, of the by-law governing the movement of ships in the harbour, increased the difficulties of any vessel which might have to enter the basin. This fact, while perhaps not affording in itself proof that she contributed to bring about the collision, is nevertheless a fact which must be taken into account in determining whether the Dragon herself was guilty of any lack of ordinary care and nautical skill which caused or materially contributed to cause the collision, and I am not at all sure that under the authorities the fact of her doing an act so manifestly wrong would not preclude her from fastening the whole burden of the collision upon the Dragon, even had the officers of the warship been guilty of any negligence which contributed to bring about the collision.\nThere is no finding or suggestion in the trial judgment of any evidence pointing to any possible negligence on the part of the Dragon other than in the particulars I have mentioned, no failure to keep a sufficient lookout before the Saguenay Trader was first observed across her course within the basin, and no lack of nautical skill respecting the orders to stop her engines and reverse, though many questions were put on the investigation and trial directed to this end. The undoubted fact is that when these orders were given the Dragon was face to face with an imminent peril and that, unless she herself had then been guilty of some negligence which contributed to bring that peril about, the warship\u2019s Commanding and Navigating Officers, being then in the agony of an imminent collision with the Saguenay Trader, could not properly be held to be accountable for any failure to exercise even ordinary care or nautical skill. Unless, therefore, there was some prior negligence upon their part which contributed to bring about the emergency she must be held blameless.\nI have already shewn, as I respectfully think, that the only findings of the learned Judge in Admiralty which could point to the possibility of any negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s ship before she encountered the Saguenay Trader in a situation of danger were not justified in law or by the evidence.\nIn my opinion it has been clearly proved by a marked preponderance of evidence, not only that the Dragon would never have hit the Maplebranch had it not been for the action of the Saguenay Trader in starting to turn around in the basin when she did, as the learned trial judge himself has expressly found, but that the collision sued for would never have occurred had not the Maplebranch herself been in the position which she took up wrongfully and without permission, and that there is no evidence upon which it can reasonably be found that the officers of the Dragon failed to exercise that degree of care and nautical skill which the law requires in order to entitle the plaintiffs to succeed. The defendant has fully discharged the whole onus which the law placed upon it.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Campbell, McMaster, Couture, Kerry & Bruneau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] (1888) 6 Asp. 396.\n[2] (1884) 9 App. Cas. 873.\n[3] [1912] A.C. 634.\n[4] (1845) 2 W.

(Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nPhoto Sound Corporation and George Perkins (Defendants) Respondents.\n1936: March 17, 18, 19; 1936: November 9.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Re-issue patent\u2014Conditions necessary for grant of\u2014Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, s. 24\u2014Interpretation\u2014Conditions that original patent be deemed \u201cdefective\u201d by reason of \u201cinsufficient description or specification\u201d arising from \u201cinadvertence, accident or mistake\u201d within the statute\u2014Action for infringement of re-issue patent\u2014Validity of amendments in re-issue patent\u2014Proper limits of expert testimony.\nThe issue of a new patent (a re-issue patent) in accordance with an amended description and specification, under s. 24 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, is not justified if the invention described in the amended description or specification and protected by the new patent is not the same invention as that to which the original patent related. The relief authorized by said s. 24 in respect of \u201cinsufficient description or specification\u201d is limited to correcting insufficiency (arising \u201cfrom inadvertence, accident or mistake\u201d) in describing or specifying in the original patent the invention in respect of which the applicant therefor intended to ask protection. The statute did not contemplate a case in which an inventor has failed to claim protection in respect of something he has invented but failed to describe or specify adequately because he did not know or believe that what he had done constituted invention in the sense of the patent law and, consequently, had no intention of describing or specifying or claiming it in his original patent. The original patent cannot be \u201cdeemed defective\u201d within s. 24 in a case where it obviously completely fulfilled the applicant\u2019s intention\u2014where the invention in respect of which he intended to obtain protection is quite certainly and sufficiently described and specified.\nOn appeal from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1936] Ex. C.R. 75), dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action for alleged infringement of a re-issue patent (for an alleged new and useful improvement in radio communications):\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The grant of the re-issue patent was unauthorized, as the conditions necessary for its grant under s. 24 (as above interpreted) were absent. The proper conclusion from the documents was that there was no defect in the statutory sense in the original patent (there was no suggestion that it could be deemed \u201cinoperative\u201d)\u2014no reasonable ground for apprehending that it was defective in failing sufficiently to describe the inventions in respect of which the applicant for it was intending to claim invention; no \u201cinadvertence, accident or mistake\u201d of the applicant in respect of the description or specification of the invention that the applicant had in mind. The pertinent documents conclusively negatived any intention on the part of the applicant for the original patent to describe or to specify any of the inventions, so-called, embraced within the amendments in the re-issue patent in so far as they were material to the present appeal. Also, in view of the evidence as to the state of the art at the time of the application for the original patent, and at the time when the applicant therefor was alleged to have conceived and perfected the inventions embraced within the amendments in respect of which relief was now claimed, it was highly improbable that he believed he was entitled to obtain protection in respect thereof; and the balance of probability supported the conclusion that he was not so entitled.\nA large part of the expert evidence given in the case (on both sides) was the subject of adverse comment by this Court, which held that much of it was not legal evidence and could not properly be taken into consideration. With reference to specified examples thereof, it was held, that any inference to be drawn from the applicant\u2019s specification in the original patent, as to whether or not the devices and arrangements in question in these proceedings were inventions of said applicant (to establish the affirmative of which was a substantive part of plaintiffs\u2019 case), was matter of fact for the court and not a matter upon which it was competent to any expert witness to pronounce; also (with reference to a witness being shown said original patent and being asked broadly to explain what said applicant was trying to do), that the issue touching the identity of the invention to which said original patent related, was a substantive issue in the action, and upon that issue no expert witness should have been permitted to express an opinion.

As to this patent in question, Maclean J. dismissed the action on the ground of lack of invention and on the ground that there was no statutory authority for the granting of the re-issue patent, as it embraced more than the invention described and claimed or intended to be described and claimed in the original patent (and the claim in the action being for infringement of features claimed as invention which appear in the re-issue only); and the appeal to this Court was (by the judgment now reported) dismissed on grounds similar to the latter ground mentioned.\nThe other patent in question was a re-issue of a patent for an alleged new and useful improvement in electrical receiving or repeating apparatus. As to this patent in question, Maclean J. dismissed the action on the ground that there was no infringement by the defendants; and the appeal to this Court was (by the judgment now reported) dismissed on the same ground.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellants.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and F. B. Chauvin for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014It will be convenient at the outset to quote the section of the statute of 1906 (R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, s. 24) from which the authority to grant the re-issue patent must be derived if such authority exists:\n24. Whenever any patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason of insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming more than he had a right to claim as new, but at the same time it appears that the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Commissioner may, upon the surrender of such patent and the payment of the further fee hereinafter provided, cause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such patentee, to be issued to him for the same invention, for any part or for the whole of the then unexpired residue of the term for which the original patent was, or might have been granted.\n2. In the event of the death of the original patentee or of his having assigned the patent, a like right shall vest in his assignee or his legal representative.\n3. Such new patent, and the amended description and specification, shall have the same effect in law, on the trial of any action thereafter commenced for any cause subsequently accruing, as if the same had been originally filed in such corrected form before the issue of the original patent.\n4. The Commissioner may entertain separate applications, and cause patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the invention patented, upon payment of the fee for a re-issue for each of such re-issue patents.\nFirst of all, the invention described in the amended description or specification and protected by the new patent must be the same invention as that to which the original patent related. Second, it is plain that the authority to issue a new patent in accordance with the amended description or specification is an authority by the exercise of which it is intended that the original patentee, or those claiming under him, shall have relief in respect of certain strictly specified things. These things, for our present purpose, are insufficient description or insufficient specification,\u2014obviously, insufficient description or insufficient specification of the invention to which the original patent related.\nThirdly, such insufficiency of description or specification in respect of which relief is authorized under this section must have arisen from inadvertence, accident or mistake.\nThese conditions necessarily imply that the inadvertence, accident or mistake must be inadvertence, accident or mistake affecting the sufficiency of the description or specification in the original patent, and it is only in respect of such inadvertence, accident or mistake that the statute contemplates relief.\nThe statute does not contemplate a case in which an inventor has failed to claim protection in respect of something he has invented but failed to describe or specify adequately because he did not know or believe that what he had done constituted invention in the sense of the patent law and, consequently, had no intention of describing or specifying or claiming it in his original patent. The tenor of the section decisively negatives any intention to make provision for relief in such a case.\nIn this connection it is to be observed that, while the section provides for relief where the patentee claims too much, there is no provision for relief where the patentee fails to claim something to which he may be entitled. In this last mentioned case, he can only obtain relief if he can bring himself within the condition relating to insufficiency of description or specification arising from inadvertence, accident or mistake affecting the sufficiency of the description or specification.\nIt is to be noted that the section is retroactive in an important respect. The amendment speaks from the date of the original patent as regards causes of action arising after the date of the new patent. Even on the strictest construction, a serious injustice may arise from the operation of this provision where people have made arrangements and expended money on the faith of the specification in the patent between the date of the original patent and of the re-issue patent,\u2014a period which in this case extended to five years. It is our duty, I think, in the circumstances, not to extend the language of the section beyond cases clearly within its intendment.\nIt will be unnecessary to discuss at length the introductory words, \u201cWhenever any patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason * * *,\u201d but one observation naturally arises out of the circumstances of the present appeal. There is no suggestion that the original patent was inoperative or could be deemed inoperative. It is essential, therefore, to enable the appellants to invoke the section, that the original patent should have been deemed defective by reason of insufficiency of description or specification arising from inadvertence, accident or mistake.\nIt is immaterial to my present purpose whether the word \u201cdeemed\u201d contemplates the view of the Commissioner or the view of the Court before whom the question of the validity of the re-issue patent comes for decision, or the view of the parties concerned. At the lowest, the statute must contemplate some kind of reasonable ground for apprehension on the part of the original patentee that the patent is defective in the sense of the section It would, in my opinion, be an abuse of this language to apply it to a case in which it is obvious that a patent completely fulfils the intention of the applicant, where there is plainly neither insufficiency of description nor specification, for the purpose which the applicant had in view; where, in other words, the invention in respect of which the patentee intended to obtain protection is quite certainly and sufficiently described and specified. In such a case, the patent is not in any proper sense of the phrase defective.\nThere is another view of the statute advanced by the appellants which I shall discuss later; but, in the view just expressed, the appellants necessarily fail; first, because the pertinent documents, the original application for the United States patent, the specification and claims in the original Canadian patent, conclusively negative any intention on the part of the applicant Arnold to describe or to specify any of the inventions, so-called, embraced within the amendments in so far as they are material to the present appeal; second, because, having regard to the evidence properly before us as to the state of the art at the time of the application for the Canadian patent, and at the time when Arnold is alleged to have conceived and perfected the inventions in respect of which relief is claimed by the appellants, it is highly improbable that Arnold believed he was entitled to obtain the protection of the law in respect of these so-called inventions; and that the balance of probability supports the conclusion that Arnold was not entitled to the protection of the patent law for these improvements, in respect of which protection is claimed.\nIn giving my reasons for these conclusions, I shall first consider the documents themselves; which constitute most weighty evidence. The two documents, the importance of which I shall emphasize, do not differ from one another in any material respect; they are Arnold\u2019s application for his United States patent, and the specification and claims in the original Canadian patent. Both these documents are signed by Arnold. There is, of course, a presumption, which is a presumption of law, that Arnold, in signing these documents, knew the nature of their contents. This presumption of law is fortified by a very powerful presumption of fact. There is quite sufficient evidence in the record to show, what nobody disputes, that Arnold was an accomplished physicist, a most competent radio engineer and master of the radio art and an experienced inventor. The documents before us, which include a number of specifications signed by him, make it quite clear that he was skilled in the art of scientific exposition, and that, also, nobody disputes.\nAt the material times, Arnold was associated with Richards, to whom reference will be made later, as assistant of Dr. Colpitts in the laboratory of the Western Electric Company, and with his staff was engaged in investigating radio communication and the practical and theoretical problems connected with it. It would hardly be disputed that few people were better fitted than he to appreciate the value of a given improvement or to form a just judgment upon the merit of it. He was an inventor accustomed to framing specifications and we may assume that he was little likely to be misled upon the point whether a given improvement gave evidence only of the application by a skilled engineer of principles and methods well known among skilled radio engineers, or of something exceptional involving invention.\nWe must proceed upon the view, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary, that Arnold knew the contents of the documents I am now about to discuss and that he knew the effect of them in accordance with their proper construction.\nOn the 31st of August, 1915, Arnold signed his application for the original U.S. patent. The meaning of the application in its relevant aspects is not doubtful. The first two paragraphs are as follows:\nBe it known that I, Harold DeForest Arnold, a citizen of the United States, residing at East Orange, in the County of Essex and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful improvements in radio communication, of which the following is a full, clear, concise and exact description.\nThis invention relates to receiving systems for radio communication, particularly to devices for limiting the electrical power which may be transmitted to a receiving instrument in such a system, and more particularly to devices in which such limiting action is obtained by employing electric currents in an evacuated vessel.\nThe next paragraph states the object of the invention: which is to provide means by which a definite upper limit is set upon the amount of power that may be communicated to a receiving circuit or apparatus. Then, in the next paragraph, the desirability of such a limitation is explained, and the explanation given is that \u201cforeign disturbances\u201d which are often \u201cof large magnitude compared with that of the normally received signals\u201d may thereby be reduced to a value not exceeding that of such signals. Then it is stated that this object is attained by an arrangement of audions described, which will be conveniently referred to hereafter as the push-pull arrangement, and by causing the thermionic currents in audions so arranged to flow\nby impressing upon their limiting electrodes, in multiple, an electromotive force operating through a high impedance, said high impedance being essential to the operation of the device for the purpose specified, * * *\nsuch purpose being to put a definite upper limit upon the amount of power communicated to the receiving apparatus.\nThen there is an explanation of the accompanying drawing which is said to represent a \u201creceiving system\u201d embodying the invention.\nIt will be observed that, up to this point, the invention is specifically stated to consist in a method for limiting the \u201celectrical power\u201d which may be transmitted to a receiving instrument in a system for radio communication. A drawing is attached to the application for the purpose of communicating a fuller understanding of the nature of the invention and for that purpose alone; and represents a receiving system for radio communication in which the invention, the power limiting device, operates in the final stage of amplification and restricts the amount of power transmitted therefrom to the ultimate receiving apparatus. The inventor declares:\nThe nature of this invention will be more fully understood by reference to the drawing, which represents a receiving system for radio communication embodying this invention, * * *\nThe specification then proceeds to trace the construction of the network by reference to the numbered parts of the drawing with explanations in some instances of the functions of those parts; and, the explanation having arrived at \u201camplifier 38,\u201d proceeds:\nThe output circuit of amplifier 38 is supplied by battery 34 and contains choke coil 42, condenser 40 and coil 41, whose functions are the same as those of the corresponding elements in the previous amplifier. It also contains condenser 43 and coil 44.\nThen we are told:\nThe apparatus to the right of 44. comprises the power-limiting device and the receiving circuit.\nReferring now to the first and second paragraphs, it is self evident that it is in the apparatus to the right of 44 that are to be found the devices limiting the amount of power which may be communicated to the final receiving circuit or apparatus; and in the conception and design of which resides the invention. It is in respect of these devices that the inventor declares he has produced an invention, and only in respect of these devices. A description of the apparatus to the right of 44 follows.\nIn explaining the operation of the system it is summarily stated that power received by the antenna is transferred to the circuit 5, 6, is augmented by the amplifier 7, is then communicated to the circuit 19, 20, is then transformed into low frequency form by rectification in element 21, is then augmented by amplifiers 31 and 38; and after this summary reference to the anterior parts of the drawing, the inventor states that the power is finally\npassed to the receiving instrument through the power limiting device whose operation will now be explained. Then follow three paragraphs in which the operation of the power limiting device comprised in the apparatus to the right of 44 is explained. Here again it is self evident that it is the power limiting device whose operation he is explaining.\nOnce again, the claims are explicitly limited to this power limiting device, with the exception of claim 1, which appears to be a combination claim for a combination of the power limiting device with the enumerated antecedent elements of a receiving system: an antenna, a tuned receiving circuit, and so on.\nAs I have already said, the inventor has left no room for doubt as to the meaning and effect of his application. He has invented, he says in his introductory paragraph, certain new and useful improvements in radio communication; and in what follows, he declares in emphatic words, he has given a full, clear and exact description of the new and useful improvements he has invented and for which in his claims he claims protection. This invention he sets forth as constituting an improvement both new and useful in a receiving circuit for radio communication. There is no other invention described. There is no suggestion that he has invented any other new and useful improvement or any other improvement, or that he has made any other invention of any description.\nIt would be an abuse of language to aver, for any purpose relevant to any controversy on this appeal, that this application describes or relates to any other invention.\nThe drawing, as I have said, was produced solely with the object of enabling the reader to comprehend the invention; that is to say, the invention with which the application is concerned. The drawing cannot be legitimately construed in any other way.\nThe parts of the drawing to the left of 44 are obviously, as matter of construction, there for the purpose of enabling the reader to realize the kind of network in which the invented devices operate and thereby the better to comprehend their purpose and mode of operation. To read the drawing in the other way is to read it as contradicting, not as illustrating, the text.\nThe application, therefore, with the appended drawing, construed in the only way in which it can properly be construed, negatives (as within the contemplation of the application) any claim by the inventor to having invented any improvement for which he is entitled to the protection of the law, in respect of any part of the apparatus disclosed by the drawing which is not involved in the invention explicitly claimed and set forth.\nIt is, therefore, of no relevancy in determining the invention to which this application relates that, by Arnold\u2019s instructions, sets of a \u201creceiving system\u201d of which the drawing, so far as it goes, would be a correct delineation, were or had been constructed; the existence of such physical objects is of no relevancy because the application has plainly no relation to any such particular physical things or contemplated physical things. There is not a syllable in the application, there is nothing in its detail, there is nothing in its general scope, there is nothing in the drawing, which can afford a foundation for the proposition that the application relates to some actually existing physical \u201creceiving system.\u201d Indeed, it obviously could not be so. An actually existing physical system in operation, or capable of being put into operation, would be of fixed dimensions, of determined physical quantities. The windings of the transformers primary and secondary, for example, would be capable of exact mathematical description. So as to audions,\u2014when actually existing in operation, or ready for operation, they must have certain physical constants, in an amplifier, an amplification factor, and so on. So also as to the condensers. There is no conceivable means by which any engineer could, from this drawing, construct any such actually existing physical system. Obviously, such a particular physical system as a whole, in all its various parts, was an invention not contemplated by this application. These physically existing sets, therefore, can be of no value in assisting us in determining what is the invention to which the application relates; they add nothing to the drawing.\nThey could not properly be resorted to for the purpose of explaining or for the purpose of limiting the scope of the invention expressly claimed. You could not properly, for example, restrict Arnold\u2019s claim in respect of his power limiting device to a claim for a power limiting device employing audions of the precise dimensions and physical constants of the audions found in these receiving sets. Nor can you find anything in the documents as they stand which justifies the introduction of the elements of these physical receiving sets as elements to be considered in the determination of the meaning of the document. The drawing is there and may be used as illustrating the text, throwing light upon the meaning of it, but only for that purpose. I shall come later to the contention already mentioned that, for the purpose of applying the statute, these receiving sets serve as a link establishing the identity of the invention to which the original patent relates and the invention to which the amendments refer. For the present, I am concerned with applying the statute according to the interpretation above mentioned which limits admissible amendments to such as may be necessary to correct any insufficiency of description or specification arising from the error of the patentee in failing adequately to describe or specify an invention in respect of which he intended to apply for protection and arising from inadvertence, accident or mistake. These observations apply equally to the specification in the surrendered Canadian patent.\nNow, I have no hesitation in drawing the inference that Arnold fully understood the scope and effect of the application of May 22nd, 1916, and of the specification in the original Canadian patent. He understood, that is to say, that he was excluding from the invention specified and claimed by him those devices and arrangements which are described and specified and claimed in the amendments in so far as we are presently concerned with such amendments. It is also very clear on the material before us that in the proceedings before the Commissioner leading up to the grant of the reissue patent no evidence was adduced to show that the specifications, the description or the claims of the original patent were insufficient to give effect to the intention of Arnold. Still less was there any evidence adduced to show that Arnold had failed to describe or to specify sufficiently the invention in respect of which he was claiming protection by reason of inadvertence, accident or mistake. Nor, indeed, is there any allegation to that effect. Again, no evidence was adduced at the trial directly bearing upon either of these points. I have examined the proceedings before the Commissioner and I cannot find there any statement made by Arnold personally that there was any such insufficiency of description or specification or any such inadvertence, accident or mistake. Indeed, there is not, I think, among these documents any statement by Arnold personally that he was the inventor of the alleged improvements to which the amendments relate. There is no reference in any of these documents to the receiving systems physically constructed upon which the appellants so much rely; still less any suggestion anywhere that the invention in respect of which the reissue patent is prayed for is to be found embodied in these existing physical things.\nThere is a letter signed in Arnold\u2019s name by R. R. Adams, attorney, which contains an argument, an ingenious argument, that the amendments contain nothing but permissible explanations of the drawings and the summary expressions in the text of the specification of the surrendered patent. The first paragraph is in these words:\nIt should be noted that in the re-issue application no change has been made in the drawing except to add three reference characters to the second vacuum tube, counting from the left, and that there is nothing, either in the specification or claims that is not illustrated in the drawing. The changes in the specification have been for the purpose of more clearly describing the parts of the device and are in the nature of insertions, amplifying somewhat the brief references in the original specification.\nThen, the statement concludes:\nIt is felt that all of the claims are properly included in the re-issue application and come well within the scope of the original patent as defined by the statement of inventions repeated in lines 20 to 25 of page 2 of the original specification and the fourteen original claims. However, on review it has been thought several claims can be cancelled without substantial loss of protection to applicant\u2019s invention and that some changes should be made in the other claims.\nThe ground upon which the application for the reissue patent is based is that everything in the amendments is to be found by implication in the specification of the original patent when read with the drawings. I have pointed out that, on the true construction of the specification, this is a wholly inadmissible proposition. What is material for my present purpose is that this letter contains no allegation that, in point of fact, it was Arnold\u2019s intention to claim or to describe or to specify the alleged invention with which the proposed amendments are concerned; or that, by reason of inadvertence, accident or mistake, he was led into some insufficiency of description or specification. Still less is there any reference to any material adduced as evidence in support of an allegation of inadvertence, accident or mistake. I shall have a word later to say with regard to these proceedings.\nIt seems perfectly plain that the reissue patent ought not to have been granted and that, unless we are at liberty to empty the provisions of the enactment under which the conditions for the grant of a reissue patent are laid down, of all substance, we are inevitably forced to the conclusion that the grant of the reissue was an unauthorized and unwarranted act. For the present, however, I am concerned only with this: the proper conclusion from the documents, including the proceedings on the application for the reissue patent, is that there was no defect in the original patent in the statutory sense, no reasonable ground for apprehending that the patent was defective in failing sufficiently to describe the inventions in respect of which Arnold was intending to claim invention; no mistake on Arnold\u2019s part in respect of the description or the specification of the invention to which his application related. Accident is not suggested nor is inadvertence in the pertinent sense; that is to say, no inadvertence in respect of any insufficiency of description or specification of the invention that the applicant had in mind. The statutable conditions governing the exercise of the authority to grant the reissue patent are all absent. This, in itself, is, of course, sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nBut it is necessary to examine the validity of the reissue patent from a point of view which stands upon a view of the statute different from that which I have expressed and which I am satisfied is the true view. The appellants say that a number of \u201creceiving systems,\u201d to employ Arnold\u2019s own expression, all of them answering the description to be found in the specification in the surrendered Canadian patents (including the drawing), had actually been constructed and set up and put in operation before the date of Arnold\u2019s application for the original Canadian patent. Invoking the interpretation clause of the Patent Act, each one of these receiving systems, it is said, embodied the devices and arrangements claimed in the amendments in the reissue patent and in question in this litigation. These physically existing things were, it is argued, inventions within the definition in the interpretation clause of the Patent Act. The original patent, it is argued, was a patent in relation inter alia to these things and so was the reissue patent. Identity of invention, it is said, is established and we are asked to say that, consequently, the authority under the statute was exercisable.\nThis argument is not convincing.\nFirst of all, the case of the appellants at the trial was that the inventive idea in respect of which Arnold was entitled to claim protection was not the condensers, the resistances, the coils, as physical things, but the use for which Arnold employed them. That is hardly consistent with the view that these physical things in themselves constituted the invention in respect of which the surrendered Canadian patent was granted.\nOn the argument before us, counsel for the appellants said, \u201cWhat the patent was directed to was a physical object.\u201d The case at the trial was not that the patent was directed to a physical object, but to certain physical objects employed in a certain way and for a certain purpose, and that it was in this employment that the merit of the inventive idea lay.\nThe argument involves, of course, the proposition that it is sufficient, in order to obtain relief under the statute, to show that the drawing in the original patent exhibits a device in respect of which the patentee might have claimed protection if he had asked for it and sufficiently disclosed the nature of the invention. This, of course, is to discard the parts of the statute that I have been emphasizing, which make it very plain that the design of the statute is to afford relief only in respect of an invention clearly conceived as such, for which the original patentee intended to claim protection, but in respect of which, through the causes defined by the statute, there is insufficient description or specification. Identity of invention is only one of the conditions of the statute.\nThen, as I have already pointed out, there is nothing in the original patent or in the specification of the original patent or the specification of the re-issue patent, or in the material before the Commissioner on the petition for the granting of the re-issue patent, dealing with these physical instruments. I have already given my reasons, and I will not repeat them, for the conclusion that it would not be sufficient to show that the devices in these physical instruments constituted improvements in respect of which Arnold might have obtained protection if he had asked for it but had no intention of asking for it, either because he was deliberately abandoning them to the public, or because he was satisfied they were not inventions in respect of which he could properly claim protection, or because he overlooked the merit of them from the point of view of invention. That is not sufficient because the inadvertence, accident or mistake in respect of the sufficiency of description or specification must constitute a defect in the patent in the sense that it fails adequately to give effect to the intention of the applicant; I repeat, these physical sets add nothing to the drawing.\nAs I have already indicated, the weight of evidence appears to me to support the conclusion that the devices and arrangements in question in this litigation were not regarded by Arnold as inventions in respect of which he was entitled to a patent, and that this conclusion is that which best accords with the balance of probability arising from all the circumstances.\nI shall deal specifically with the alleged patentable features of the alleged inventions which are described in the pertinent parts of the amended specification and claims in the re-issue patent. Before doing so, it is convenient to sketch some facts in the development of the instrument known as the audion. The audion, as invented by DeForest about the year 1906 or 1907, was a valve having three electrodes. The record contains the specifications in several patents granted to him in respect of improvements in the audion and circuits in which the audion was a part. A fact which it is useful to keep in mind in considering the evidence before us, and the arguments presented to us, is that the audion, as conceived and devised by DeForest, operated by a current of electricity passed through a gaseous medium. I do not wish to be misunderstood. In modern vacuum tubes a very high degree of evacuation has been achieved and the pure electron stream which passes from the cathode to the anode is not in any way dependent upon the conductivity of the small amount of residual atmospheric air or gas that may remain within the tube. But the audion, as conceived by DeForest, was an instrument in which the conductivity of a gaseous content was made use of purposely, and the term \u201caudion,\u201d which was applied by DeForest to his instrument, continued, at all events, down to the end of the period with which we are concerned in this appeal, to be applied to that type of instrument; although for the last twenty years or so it may have been used to describe a vacuum tube having the general features of the audion as invented by DeForest but evacuated as completely as the pumps and other means at the command of engineers and manufacturers make possible.\nThere is some oral evidence with regard to these matters which is not very satisfactory and I have been obliged to resort to the documents in the record to obtain information upon them. Specifications of United States patents applied for by DeForest on the 14th February, 1906, 27th August, 1906, and 25th October, 1906, and 29th January, 1907, are in evidence. The first paragraph of the claim in the first of these is thus expressed:\nAn oscillation-detector comprising two electrodes separated by a heated gaseous medium, one of said electrodes consisting of mercury.\nIn the second, the description of the invention contains this sentence:\nD represents an evacuated vessel of glass or other suitable material having two separated electrodes F and F\u2019 between which intervenes the gaseous medium which, when sufficiently heated or otherwise made highly conducting, forms the sensitive element of my oscillation detector.\nIn the third, there is described a three-electrode device, in other words, an audion, in which the first claim is expressed as follows:\nIn a device for amplifying electrical currents, an evacuated vessel inclosing a sensitive conducting gaseous medium maintained in a condition of molecular activity, * * *\nIn the last of them, the objects of the invention are thus stated:\n* * * to increase the sensitiveness of oscillation detectors comprising in their construction a gaseous medium by means of the structural features and circuit arrangements which are hereinafter more fully described.\nThis specification describes a particular type of audion which is referred to later in a specification of a patent issued to Arnold upon an application of the 28th May, 1914.\nThe invention, the specification states, is for \u201cnew and useful improvements in gaseous repeaters in circuits of low impedance.\u201d The specification proceeds to state that, of these improvements, the \u201c following is a full, clear, concise and exact description\u201d:\nStill more particularly, [the invention] relates to the use of thermionic repeaters for securing amplification of current in circuits of low impedance. By a thermionic current is meant current discharge from a hot cathode. Examples of thermionic repeaters are the DeForest audion disclosed in Patent No. 879,532, dated February 18, 1914, and others, the Von Lieben & Riesz repeater disclosed in Patent No. 1,038,910, dated September 17, 1912, etc. By vacuum discharge is meant current discharge between electrodes in space from which nearly all atmosphere is exhausted. The expression vacuum discharge repeaters is intended to include repeaters of the thermionic types and also those in which current flows between electrodes in space maintained in a conductive state by the are or otherwise. The mercury arc repeater of an earlier application of this applicant, Serial No. 709,445, filed July 13, 1912, is an example of the class of vacuum discharge repeaters but it is not of the thermionic type.\nFebruary 18, 1914, ought to be February 18, 1908, as appears from the serial number 841,568.\nIt will be observed that the specification describes improvements in \u201cgaseous repeaters.\u201d The DeForest audion and the Von Lieben repeater, both of which make use of the conductivity of the gaseous content, are given as typical examples of thermionic repeaters of the type to which the specification relates. Entire exhaustion of the atmosphere is not contemplated.\nNow this specification shows in the plainest way that such gaseous repeaters were, in the mind of Arnold, properly designated by the term \u201caudion.\u201d Indeed, in his description of his invention he invariably selects the \u201caudion\u201d as the gaseous repeater which exemplifies it, although he does not exclude other types\u2014the repeaters are \u201cpreferably audions.\u201d In explaining the drawings the repeaters are always described as \u201caudions.\u201d Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 use the term \u201cthermionic repeaters,\u201d of which, as already mentioned, the typical examples given are the DeForest audion and the Von Lieben repeater; while in claim 5, the term \u201cvacuum discharge repeaters\u201d is employed which, as already mentioned, contemplates a repeater from which the atmosphere is not entirely exhausted. This, let it be noted, is Arnold\u2019s conception of the term \u201caudion,\u201d as appears from a patent dated the 2nd March, 1915, granted on an application dated the 22nd March, 1914.\nIn the application for Arnold\u2019s U.S. patent in respect of the invention which is now in question, dated the 31st August, 1915, the repeaters which are employed in the power limiting device, that is to say, in the apparatus immediately to the right of number 44 in the diagram of the network attached to the application, are described in the claims as \u201cthermionic repeaters\u201d and \u201cthermionic elements.\u201d In the body of the specifications these structures are said to be \u201cof the audion type\u201d; and in the claims in the surrendered Canadian patent they are (in claims 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14) described as \u201caudions\u201d; while in claim 1 they are referred to as \u201cthermionic elements\u201d and in claim 3 as \u201cthermionic repeaters.\u201d There is not a suggestion in either the specification or the claim that the term \u201caudion\u201d in these documents does not designate repeaters of the type described as audions in Arnold\u2019s patent of the 2nd March, 1915, and his application of the 28th May, 1914. Indeed, the specification contains a reference which is definitely at variance with any such suggestion.\nIn describing the power limiting device and the means for securing uni-lateral conductivity, he distinguishes his own device from that invented by E. H. Colpitts and described in U.S. patent 1,128,292, by the circumstance that in Arnold\u2019s own device the electromotive force employed for driving the plate current operates through a high impedance and by that circumstance alone.\nNow, turning to Colpitts\u2019 patent which was applied for on the 3rd of January, 1914, and granted on the 16th of February, 1915. We have a careful description of Colpitts\u2019 push-pull arrangement; the arrangement which Arnold adopts subject to the alteration mentioned. \u201cThis invention,\u201d Colpitts says,\nrelates to electric wave repeating apparatus and particularly to the use of vacuum discharge repeaters as exemplified by the so-called \u201caudion\u201d for repeating and amplifying in an output circuit waves of electric energy received in an input circuit.\nHe adds:\nThe principal parts of an audion element or structure are a heated filament or other source of ionization, an anode usually called a \u201cplate,\u201d and an intermediate electrode usually called a \u201cgrid.\u201d These are preferably inclosed in an evacuated glass vessel. Characteristic features of the audion are that current can flow in one direction only in the ionized stream, and that the strength of current in the stream flowing from its source to the plate is modified by electrostatic rather than by electromagnetic force as in some other types of \u201cgaseous\u201d repeaters.\nColpitts would appear to have been an experienced and competent engineer, and it will be observed that he mentions as a characteristic feature of the audion that the current can flow in one direction only in \u201cthe ionized stream\u201d and that the function which he ascribes to the heated filament is that it is \u201ca source of ionization.\u201d\nTurning now to the claims,\u2014in the first claim the repeating apparatus is said to comprise a\n* * * divided input and divided output circuits, means for producing two ionized streams, said streams being oppositely included in said output circuit, and two electrodes for controlling said ionized streams respectively and oppositely connected in said input circuit.\nIn claim 7, the combination of the two repeating elements is said to comprise \u201ca common source of ionization.\u201d This document appears to have been signed by Colpitts on the last day of December, 1913. The patent, issued on the 16th of February, 1915, as I have already observed, must have been present to Arnold\u2019s mind when he signed his application for the United States patent on the 31st August, 1915.\nThere is another patent of Colpitts for which application was made on the 18th May, 1914, the patent being granted on the 27th April, 1915, five days before the grant of Arnold\u2019s patent for improvements in audions which, as already pointed out, he gives as the preferable type of \u201cgaseous repeaters\u201d for his purposes. Colpitts\u2019 repeaters are described by him as audions. The space within the audion between the plate and filament is described as \u201cthe ionized space.\u201d The claims comprise \u201cmeans for producing a state of ionization in the evacuated vessel.\u201d\nIn a patent applied for on the 24th of June, 1913, and granted to DeForest in 1921, the repeaters are described as audions, and the electrodes within the evacuated vessel as being surrounded by a gaseous conducting space.\nThe specification in a patent granted to Richards on the 14th of July, 1914, on an application of the 8th of February, 1913, relates to devices intended for use in connection with relays of the \u201cgaseous type, such, for instance, as disclosed in letters patent [of] January 15th, 1907, and February 18th, 1908, granted to Lee DeForest.\u201d \u201cThis device,\u201d it is stated,\nis well known in the art and termed an \u201caudion\u201d and because of the grid shaped element is sometimes known as the \u201cgrid-audion.\u201d\nThe objects of the invention, it is stated,\nare obtained in this invention by the provision of an alternative or shunt path for the energy normally passing through this gaseous conductor.\n\u201cIt is obvious,\u201d it is said, that the improvement disclosed herein may be applied to any of the various types of audions and similar gaseous relays without the exercise of invention.\nIt seems to follow from these documents, which would appear to be the most reliable evidence of contemporary usage, that, at the time of Arnold\u2019s application for his Canadian patent in 1916, the term \u201caudion\u201d was known among engineers and specialists in radio engineering as a term originally applied by DeForest to a repeater employing a conducting gaseous content and normally designating a repeater of that character; although there may be room for conjecture that shortly afterwards it came to be loosely used also as applying to any three-electrode repeater.\nLight is thrown upon the use of the term by another set of contemporary documents. Reference will first be made to a patent granted to Langmuir on the 23rd of July, 1918, upon an application of the 29th of December, 1913. \u201cThe electron discharge tube\u201d is described in these words:\nIn carrying my invention into practice I make use of an energy storing device arranged in co-operative relation with electron discharge tubes. By the term \u201celectron discharge tube\u201d I mean to imply the use of a highly exhausted envelop containing at least two electrodes one of which is provided with means for causing it to emit electrons. A device of this nature when connected to a source of current operates selectively in such a manner as to allow current to flow between the electrodes in only one direction; that is, there will be a flow of negative electricity from the electron emitting electrode to the other electrode or electrodes, but no flow in the opposite direction. In order that this result may be obtained when a potential of more than 20 or 30 volts is applied it is necessary to have the highest possible exhaustion of the envelop. Otherwise there will be a heavy ionization of the gas present and this will render the device useless for my purpose. By improved methods of exhausting the envelop, however, such a high vacuum may be secured that for any voltage which is applied there is no appreciable gas ionization but the flow of current is the result of a pure electron discharge and is entirely independent of any gas conductivity.\nThat is the way in which a scientist and an engineer familiar with radio engineering and its terms of art describes, at the relevant period, an instrument which operates without appreciable gas ionization and whose current is the result of a pure electron discharge independently of any gas conductivity. \u201cThe electron discharge tube\u201d had evidently been described in applications filed on the 16th October, 1913, and it is explained with similar explicitness in the specification under a patent granted 24th April, 1917, and applied for July 15th, 1914. This device is also described in the specification of a patent granted to Alexanderson on the 22nd of February, 1916, for which application was made on the 29th of October, 1913. The invention was for a selective tuning system. The system as described includes Langmuir\u2019s \u201celectron discharge tube\u201d but it is said that the invention is not confined to a relaying device operating with a pure electron discharge. In other words, the invention was not confined to a device operating independently of gas conductivity.\nIt results from all this that, according to the usage of the time, the claims in Arnold\u2019s Canadian patent embrace audions in the proper sense of the term, audions as described by DeForest, by Colpitts, by Richards and by Arnold himself, as is shown in his specification for improvements in \u201cgaseous repeaters.\u201d His invention is stated in his application for his U.S. patent and in his surrendered Canadian patent to be a \u201cpower limiting device\u201d and relates to appliances to be found to the right of the figure 44 in his sketch. The power limiting device included audions arranged in push-pull relation after the manner, subject to the qualification mentioned, explained in Colpitts\u2019 patent, and there is nowhere the slightest suggestion, or the slightest ground for a suggestion, that \u201cthe thermionic repeaters\u201d which form a part of the network are repeaters of the character described by Langmuir and Alexanderson as \u201celectron discharge devices\u201d operating with a pure electron stream through a medium exhausted in the manner described by Langmuir.\nIt will be convenient now to quote from the appellants\u2019 factum a very concise description of the features of Arnold\u2019s 1915 receiving system to which it is alleged that the claims sued upon in the re-issue patent relate:\n(1) the arrangement whereby a single audion is used for one stage of amplification and two audions in what is known as push-pull relation are used in the next stage (claims 33, 34, 36 and 37),\n(2) the interposition of a resistance or impedance in shunt to the coil of a transformer between two stages of amplification (claims 53 to 55) with provision for the adjustability of this resistance (claims 61 to 70 inclusive) and its use in combination with a negative bias on the grid (claims 56 to 60), and\n(3) the provision of condensers and choke coils in order to allow the audions in the successive stages of amplification to be energized from a single common battery (claims 77, 78, 85 and 86). As to the first of these alleged patentable features of Arnold\u2019s \u201creceiving system,\u201d three things are admitted,\u2014 (1) that Colpitts, in the patent already referred to, had patented a push-pull arrangement which Arnold, with the modification mentioned in his specification, was virtually adopting. It is plain enough from the explanations of Colpitts that this arrangement was intended as one stage in a system of amplification. (2) It is admitted that a system by which a series of audions were so arranged that each one successively amplified the output of the last was well known. And (3) the system was well understood under which one push-pull arrangement immediately succeeded another push-pull arrangement.\nThese things being given, I find it difficult to perceive the invention involved in Arnold\u2019s arrangement; I do not doubt that Arnold regarded it as an arrangement well within the range of competent engineering skill.\nIt was argued that Arnold for the first time perceived that distortion is reduced when the electric energy fed into the incoming circuit of an audion is \u201cwell within the capacity,\u201d according to the phrase used, of the audion. Now, there is not a word in the specification of the surrendered Canadian patent, nor is there a suggestion in the drawings, to indicate such a limitation of the power fed from audion 38 into the push-pull arrangement. Nor, indeed, is this condition of the effectiveness of the arrangement set forth in the re-issue patent. If such was the condition of the practical working of this combination and invention was involved in the appreciation of it, then it should have been clearly and plainly stated and, in the absence of such a statement, the disclosure is, in my judgment, insufficient. However, the conclusive answer to this contention is that it was well known that with the audion of that period the amplifying circuit worked satisfactorily only on limited amounts of incoming energy. That is stated by Richards in the specification in his patent, to which reference has already been made, for which he applied on the 8th of February, 1913, and which was granted on the 14th of July, 1914. Richards explains that the relays of the type to which his invention relates, and to which this observation applies, which he describes as relays of the gaseous type, are relays such as those disclosed in the patents to DeForest already referred to which are dated January 15, 1907, and February 18, 1908. Such devices, he says, are known in the art and are termed \u201caudions.\u201d\nI shall have to refer to Richards\u2019 actual invention on the point next discussed and, in that connection, to a note of Richards dated the 21st of November, 1912.\nRichards and Arnold had been associated and Arnold signs Richards\u2019 note as a witness. It is quite plain that Richards in his specification is referring to a condition well understood and that his invention aims at providing a remedy. It was very freely suggested in the course of the trial and on the argument that Richards was dealing with a type of instrument that went out of vogue before Arnold\u2019s invention was complete. Richards, it was argued, was directing his attention to totally different conditions. I shall point out why this view is inadmissible.\nAs regards the second feature, the employment of a resistance for the purpose of improving the operation of, or the fidelity of reproduction by the audion is the substance of the patent of Richards to which I have just referred; and it is now necessary to examine the evidence adduced bearing upon the employment of this device by Arnold. Arnold and Richards, let me repeat, were associated as the assistants of Colpitts. Arnold witnessed the note that I am just about to quote. The circumstances all point to the conclusion that Arnold was familiar with Richards\u2019 idea of employing the resistance and that he did not in any way regard it as an invention of his own.\nOn the 21st of November, 1912, Richards made a note in the following words, which note was signed by Richards, his signature being witnessed by Arnold:\nTry shunting grid and plate of audion to prevent excessive talking current from knocking down the efficiency of the repeater circuit. Advise work with a 5-K coil and 88 megohm connected in series. Mr. Mills constructed a new circuit and used this shunt with success.\nThe note seems to show that the condition restricting the usefulness of audions was well recognized, viz., that signals in which the current is excessive impair the efficiency of the repeater circuit; and the proposal is that the grid and plate of the audion shall be shunted for the purpose of correcting this. He appears to suggest an inductive and a non-inductive resistance in series for that purpose. Then he adds that, in a circuit newly constructed, this shunt has been employed with success.\nThe conception of Arnold\u2019s invention, it seems to be suggested, was complete in March, 1914, and was embodied in circuits which were constructed in the summer of 1914. Now, there are two notes of Arnold, one on the 10th of March, 1914, and one on the 4th of March, 1914, as follows:\nArrived to put in standard B audions, with higher B current, negative cells in C circuit, high fixed resistance across high side of input transformer, adjusting gain by tapping off across part of this for the grid. Checked high resistance coils\u2014all about 50,000w each.\n* * *\nNote the advantages of using a high negative C voltage in audion in improving the uniformity of magnification over ranges of output, and also in improving exactness of reproduction.\nThe first thing to be observed about these notes is that they all refer to \u201caudions\u201d and, as already pointed out, the contemporary documents show plainly that the term \u201caudion\u201d at that time was used as designating a gaseous conductor. As to the notes of the year 1912, there can be no manner of doubt that Richards and Arnold were dealing with the same type of repeater,\u2014the audion of DeForest described by Arnold, Richards and Colpitts as a \u201cgaseous repeater.\u201d Kendall, it is true, says the standard B audion was the standard \u201chigh space current audion.\u201d There is no explanation of that term. Its natural meaning is an audion having space current of high value. That is, I presume, a high plate filament current. There is nothing in that to suggest an instrument of the character of the \u201celectron discharge repeater\u201d described by Langmuir and exhausted as explained by Langmuir with precision. There is no reason for thinking that Arnold in 1912 when he used the term \u201caudion\u201d had in his mind a repeater different in character from the gaseous repeater well known, as Richards says, in the art as the \u201caudion,\u201d invented by DeForest and referred to by Arnold himself in the specification in his patent of the 2nd of March, 1915, as the audion of the usual type. There is, to be sure, a statement by the appellants\u2019 witness Johnson in rebuttal that when gas did appear in the DeForest tubes it was an abnormal condition. It is, of course, perfectly plain from what has already been said that at the relevant times the presence of gas in a DeForest tube was the normal condition. But the consideration which is entirely conclusive upon this point is the fact that in his Canadian specification, Arnold, as has been pointed out, uses the term \u201caudion\u201d to describe the type of repeaters which his invention contemplates. In October, 1913, Langmuir had applied for patents in respect of his \u201celectron discharge tube\u201d and in February, 1916, a year and a half before Arnold\u2019s Canadian patent was granted, Alexanderson had received a patent in which he described the \u201celectron discharge\u201d tube as a device having a vacuum so high that gas ionization by collision is substantially absent. It was stated categorically by the witness Johnson that Arnold was the first to use in 1913 a tube which he spoke of as the high vacuum tube. He was obliged to admit that he was speaking from hearsay, and then finally said such tubes were known in 1913. If Arnold, in his note of 1912 and his notes of 1914, had in mind a repeater of this description and not the type of repeater which he and Richards and Colpitts had been in the habit of describing as an audion, it seems extraordinary that something was not said about it, and still more extraordinary that something was not said about it in the specification for the Canadian patent which issued in October, 1917.\nIt is impossible to maintain the contention that Arnold\u2019s resistance is something different from Richards\u2019 resistance on the ground that Arnold was dealing with one type of repeater and Richards with another.\nThen it is sought to get rid of the Richards patent by labelling his patent a \u201cblue glow preventer.\u201d It is abundantly plain from the documentary evidence before us that the blue glow was merely evidence of a condition of instability which, unless prevented, paralyzed the operation of the repeater. No doubt the high evacuation of the tube achieved by Langmuir greatly aided this prevention, and, perhaps, completely accomplished it, but, I repeat, we are not concerned with Langmuir\u2019s \u201celectron discharge\u201d device, we are concerned with the \u201caudion.\u201d\nMuch the same considerations apply to the negative bias on the grid. As far back as April, 1912, Lowenstein had applied for a patent of a means for coping with the distortion arising from the unequal magnification of weak and strong signals and high and low frequencies in which he employed the negative grid bias. It is perfectly true that his patent contemplated the presence of some gaseous content in the repeater as DeForest\u2019s previous patent did, and Arnold\u2019s and Colpitts\u2019 subsequent patents did. But the problem is stated and the solution is given.\nIn May, 1914, Colpitts applied for a patent which was granted in April, 1915, a patent which has already been referred to. There appears in the drawings the combination of the negative bias on the grid and the resistance in shunt to the input electrode. And again, in an application made by Van der Bijl on the 21st of August, 1915, there is an association of resistances in shunt, grid bias and potentiometer shown in the drawings. Although this association is plainly disclosed, there is, by Colpitts, not even a reference to any of these devices in his specification, and none that I can discover in Van der Bijl.\nThese facts are important as showing that such an association was something well understood and this may properly be regarded as throwing light upon the fact that in Arnold\u2019s application for his U.S. patent, which is dated the 31st of August, 1915,\u2014one year later than Colpitts\u2019 application and some months later than Colpitts\u2019 patent, and a week later than Van der Bijl\u2019s application\u2014he passes over this association in the same way without comment.\nHaving regard to all these circumstances, it seems improbable that the employment by Arnold in 1914 of the negative bias and variable high resistance in combination was regarded by him as involving any advance not well within the scope of the skill of a trained specialist in these matters having a knowledge of what was generally known among such specialists; that is, on all the facts, the most natural explanation of the fact that he did not claim protection for this arrangement as an invention.\nAs to the third feature in respect of which protection is claimed, I would simply say that I see no satisfactory evidence of invention.\nThe form of Arnold\u2019s specification in the surrendered patent is, therefore, in my opinion, capable of the very simple explanation I have mentioned: that in respect of these matters in controversy in this appeal, he did not regard them as new or as inventions of his. The appellants complain that the learned trial judge did not act upon the evidence of their experts. I regret to say that a large part of the evidence given by experts on both sides consists of material which ought not to be present in the record, for the plain reason that it is not legal evidence and cannot properly be taken into consideration by this Court, which, it hardly seems necessary to state, is a court of law. Some of the evidence given by the experts bearing upon the state of the art, what for brevity I have called the radio art, at a time when they were practitioners in that art, and are, therefore, competent to speak about it, is not only admissible but of weight and value. Some of it, although, perhaps, technically admissible, given by the witnesses in relation to the state of the art at a time when they had not much more than entered upon their studies as engineering students, is of no value. Some of it ought never to have been given. It is contradicted by the documents in the case and is obviously wrong. On the other hand, as I have said, there is a great mass of it which could not be properly taken into account by this Court, but the presence of which in the record substantially increases the labour of the Court, which is obliged to separate the legal from the irrelevant evidence. I mention two examples only\u2014\nThe witness Johnson, who left the University of North Dakota in 1913-14 and entered Yale in the following year, professed to give evidence as to the problems with which Arnold was confronted from 1912-14 when he was perfecting his alleged invention, and, after descanting at great length about what Arnold had in his mind and was trying to do, was compelled to admit on cross-examination that he had never met Arnold before 1916, and that everything he said was an inference drawn by him from the specifications in the original patent and in the re-issue patent. In point of fact, it is quite obvious from perusal of his evidence that he is mainly speaking from the re-issue patent.\nNow, it was a part of the case advanced by the appellants, a substantive part of their case, to establish that the devices and arrangements in question in these proceedings were inventions of Arnold, and any inference with regard to that to be drawn from Arnold\u2019s specification signed by him in 1915, if any such inference could be drawn, was matter of fact for the Court and not a matter upon which it was competent to any expert witness to pronounce. The opinions of such persons on such matters are entirely without legal relevancy and cannot be considered in this Court.\nAgain, the respondent\u2019s witness Kelley had put in his hands Arnold\u2019s original patent and was asked broadly to explain what Arnold was trying to do. The issue touching the identity of the invention to which Arnold\u2019s original patent related was a substantive issue in the action and upon that issue no expert witness should have been permitted to express an opinion.\nThe proper limits of expert testimony are well understood; the subject has, however, recently been the subject of comment by Lord Tomlin, and I think it is desirable to reproduce in full what Lord Tomlin said upon it (British Celanese, Ld. v. Courtaulds, Ld.[2]):\nThe area of the territory in which in cases of this kind an expert witness may legitimately move is not doubtful. He is entitled to give evidence as to the state of the art at any given time. He is entitled to explain the meaning of any technical terms used in the art. He is entitled to say whether in his opinion that which is described in the specification on a given hypothesis as to its meaning is capable of being carried into effect by a skilled worker. He is entitled to say what at a given time to him as skilled in the art a given piece of apparatus or a given sentence on any given hypothesis as to its meaning would have taught or suggested to him. He is entitled to say whether in his opinion a particular operation in connection with the art could be carried out and generally to give any explanation required as to facts of a scientific kind.\nHe is not entitled to say nor is counsel entitled to ask him what the specification means, nor does the question become any more admissible if it takes the form of asking him what it means to him as an engineer or as a chemist. Nor is he entitled to say whether any given step or alteration is obvious, that being a question for the court.\nIn the present case much time was occupied and substantial parts of the shorthand notes have been filled with questions and answers which in my opinion were not admissible.\nTo illustrate what I mean I will venture to call your Lordships\u2019 attention to a few examples taken at haphazard.\nEvidence.

Now turn to Boullier, No. 15015 of 1908. First of all you might tell my Lord what you understand Boullier to describe?\u2014 Boullier has got some idea of heating the filaments by radiation. * * *\nP. 210, Q. 1807. * * * I suggest that means by the capacity of the apparatus to squirt?\u2014Yes.\nQ. 1809. So that we have here downward spinning and outside winding?\u2014Yes, but which end of the filament do you imagine he takes hold of?\nQ. 1810. Not the one in the jet, at all events?\u2014I do not think it means \u201ccontinuous\u201d at all. What I read here is that he squirts until he has a tangle of his filament on the bottom of his apparatus.\nP. 211, Q. 1815. It does not say anything about waiting on the bottom?\u2014I think it does.\nEvidence, Vol. II, p, 867, Q. 9537. Then it continues: \u201cbut is usually only very short so that the filaments can be spun at a high speed and need only travel a relatively short distance in the casing.\u201d Does that passage there convey to your mind the necessity or desirability of a long casing?\u2014No. Rather the reverse.\nQ. 9538. Then just going on from line 50: \u201cBy way of example we have found that in most cases the volatile liquids are sufficiently evaporated and the filaments sufficiently solidified by a travel of one to two seconds exposed to a warm air current of about 30 deg. to 50 deg. C. in the casing.\u201d Just bearing in mind that with the Provisional there are no drawings, does that passage enable you to gather anything as regards the speed of spinning?\u2014No.\nQ. 9542. I just want to ask one question on that paragraph. You see at line 115 it is dealing with guides, and I just want you to explain to his Lordship what you understand by this paragraph: \u201cThe said guide or guides may be located in the aperture or apertures through which the filaments leave the casing, or when the associated filaments pass round or over more than one guide in the casing, the last of each series of these may be placed in the issue apertures.\u201d What does that convey to your mind?\u2014The possibility of carrying the filaments in a zig-zag path to and fro inside the casing, in order to get the requisite length of travel, without needlessly extending the length of the casing. Of course, it also includes a case in which the filaments pass direct to an outlet, and over a single guide.\nP. 887, Q. 9681. Then at line 21: \u201cUnder the conditions above described, the matter is expelled in the form of a continuous thread whose length is only limited by the capacity of the apparatus.\u201d What does that convey to your mind?\u2014It conveyed to my mind the limit as to the amount of material he can expel by his piston from his containing vessel. He has spoken of expelling the thread by means of a piston at page 2, line 15, and I assume he was speaking of a sort of charge which he could put in such a cylinder and expel by the piston.\nQ. 9682. He goes on: \u201cThe thread or filament coagulated as above described after traversing the coagulating medium is drawn out by its extremity and wound on a roller or reel whence it is rewound on bobbins or into balls or skeins or by any suitable means, which it is unnecessary to describe.\u201d Does that convey anything to your mind as regards the position of the winding or the time when it takes place after the coagulation?\u2014Yes; it does suggest that after traversing the coagulating medium the thread is drawn out by its extremity. That suggests to my mind that it is drawn out of the apparatus and conveyed direct to a roller or reel on which it is wound. P. 893, Q. 9762. Do you find in Boullier\u2019s, Specification any direction as to whether there would foe a casing or an enclosed space or not?\u2014 Yes. He suggests that at any rate the back and sides should foe closed in and that there should be a front put on where you want to limit the loss of heat by radiation.\nP. 986, Q. 9797. Just look at the last lines in Suvern. \u201cBy this arrangement, the recovery of the solvent is also facilitated, since the same evaporates in comparatively only narrow chambers\u201d?\u2014Yes, that I think is quite obvious.\nQ. 9798. So that you have narrow chambers\u2014\nSir Arthur Colefax: Please do not lead here because it is absolutely in conflict with what this discloses.\nSir Stafford Cripps: I did not appreciate that there was any conflict upon this at all.\nQ. 9799. Do you therefore find that Suvern tells you as an engineer that narrow chambers were used?\u2014Yes.\nP. 902, Q. 9868. What does that convey to your mind?\u2014The film is formed by evaporation, or elimination of solvent and coagulation or coming together of the particles of viscose to make a relatively solid film, much as milk will coagulate on a heated liquid. The surface then will consist of a more coagulated body, substantially solid, but still containing a good deal of liquid.\nP. 904, Q. 9875. I am coming back afterwards to ask you a question on page 250, but I want to deal with the viscose point first, if I may. I have read you the middle of page 250, except the last two lines, where he says: \u201cHowever, provision has then to be made for hardening them\u201d\u2014 that is the filaments\u2014\u201cas rapidly as possible, so that they may be reeled up. While viscose coagulates by itself in the air, too much time would in the case in question be required for the purpose.\u201d When it speaks of coagulating by itself in the air, bearing in mind the paragraph we have been looking at on page 132, where he tells you how that happens, what do you imagine he means there?\u2014He means that if you tried to form a filament by allowing the viscose to coagulate in air at an ordinary temperature, the process would be altogether too slow to enable you to carry out that process and make a filament.\nQ. 9878. I will just read to the end of the paragraph: \u201cand the viscose threads after having been stretched to a certain length must be further treated according to this principle\u201d; what do you understand \u201cthis principle\u201d to mean?\u2014Continued heating, probably after the threads have been formed and wound up, sufficient to convert the solidified viscose into viscoid.\nP. 905, Q. 9886. Now: \u201cFor the purpose of converting the fluid viscose thread into the solid viscoid thread a current of hot air ascends in the shaft through which the thread sinks down\u201d?\u2014Yes.\nQ. 9887. Would that be what is called counter current?\u2014Yes, but he would not get it converted in such a shaft during its formation into a true viscoid. I think the word is used loosely there.\nThe disadvantages of these methods are two-fold.\nIn the first place time is wasted and money spent on what is not legitimate. In the second place there accumulates a mass of material which so far from assisting the Judge renders his task the more difficult, because he has to sift the grain from an unnecessary amount of chaff.\nIt is advisable, I think, to repeat, for the purpose of emphasizing it, what I have said about the proceedings leading to the grant of the reissue patent. There can be little doubt that, as already observed, in granting the reissue patent, the conditions laid down by the statute were entirely disregarded. One is struck with amazement when one observes the utter absence of any attempt on the part of the applicants to offer evidence to establish the existence of the statutory conditions. As I have said, the fact upon which the appellants mainly rely in this appeal, viz., the existence in operation of certain \u201creceiving systems\u201d answering the description provided by the drawing in the original patent, is not mentioned in the application. There was produced literally no evidence of inadvertence or accident or mistake. It is too plain that the grant was quite destitute of legal authority.\nAs to Kendall\u2019s patent, I am satisfied there was no infringement.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Chauvin, Walker, Stewart & Martineau.\n[1] [1936] Ex.

Under the Alberta Legal Profession Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 206, the benchers of the Law Society of Alberta were to appoint and maintain a \"discipline committee,\" consisting of at least three members, who were to deal with complaints against any member of the Society, and might recommend that the benchers strike the name of the member off the rolls, and the benchers might order the same to be done. There were provisions for procedure before the discipline committee. The member might appeal \"from the decision of the committee and of the benchers\" to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, the appeal to be by notice to the benchers and \"founded upon a copy of the proceedings before the said committee and the benchers, the evidence taken, the committee's report and the order made by the benchers thereon.\nThe benchers had appointed R. as chairman, and all the other benchers as members, of the discipline committee. On complaints lodged against plantiff (a member of the Law Society), R. appointed three benchers as a special committee to examine into them, receive evidence, and report. They held meetings, of which notice was given plaintiff, who had full opportunity to, and did, hear the evidence, cross-examine, and adduce evidence. This special committee then reported to the convocation of benchers that they had found the complaints proven, that plaintiff had been guilty of improper professional conduct, and they recommended that his name be struck from the rolls of the Society. This recommendation was received and adopted by the convocation on July 5, 1923; it was further recorded that plaintiff was found to have been guilty of improper professional conduct; and it was ordered that his name be, and it was, struck off the rolls. Plaintiff did not appeal. In 1924, 1926, 1927, and 1930, he applied for reinstatement. He did not know until 1925 that the committee before which he had appeared was not the official discipline committee. In 1928 he sued the Law Society of Alberta, alleging that his name had wrongfully and without legal right been struck off the rolls, and praying for a declaration that he was still a member of the Society, entitled to practise, and claiming damages.\nHeld:(1) Plaintiff was entitled to have his name restored to the rolls.\nThe benchers' order striking it off was null and void. Under the Act such an order could be made only after investigation and recommendation by the discipline committee, which never took place. The fact that the official discipline committee comprised all the benchers who eventually received and adopted the recommendation of the special committee, could not, even apart from the fact that those benchers adopt- ing it had made no investigation of their own, overcome the statutory requirement of the acting by the discipline committee as a distinctive body. (Per Duff C.J.: The discipline committee, in ascertaining the facts, may proceed through the agency of one or more of its members for the purpose of taking evidence; and getting the facts. But in deciding upon their recommendation the discipline committee must, under the Act, give the member charged an opportunity of appearing before them and presenting his defence. It might be that, had plaintiff been heard in his defence by the benchers in convocation, the report of the special committee, notwithstanding the form of the proceedings, might have been considered as adopted by the benchers, sitting as a discipline committee, after hearing plaintiff, as the Act requires; and that the proceedings might have been considered as conforming in substance to the statutory procedure. The error of substance was in not giving plaintiff a hearing before the members comprising the discipline committee; and this defect sterilized the proceedings as regards legal consequences).\nIt was not a case where plaintiff should have appealed under the Act, because(1) there was no recommendation of the discipline committee from which he could appeal, and(2) the benchers' order was a nullity. Nor could plaintiff by his conduct be taken to have abandoned by waiver or consent his rightful objections to the validity of the proceedings and of the order; moreover, since the benchers' lack of power deprived the order of any effect, and the legislation in question must be looked at from the viewpoint of public interest, estoppel on the ground of acquiescence could not be invoked.\n(2) The act of the benchers, obviously done in good faith, was not such as would entail any liability on defendant in damages. In exercising their power of striking a member's name from the rolls, the benchers perform a function not merely ministerial, but discretionary and judicial. In this case they were intending, in what they did, to do what they were entitled to do, viz., to perform their statutory public duties. They made the order in what they bona fide believed to be the exercise of a judicial discretion, and they, or the defendant society which they represented, were not subject to an action in damages because the report which they adopted as the foundation of their order happened, without their actual knowledge, to lack authority and validity (Partridge v. General Council of Medical Education, 25 Q.B.D. 90).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1935] 1 W.W.R. 735, dismissing the action, reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing and setting aside the judgment of Simmons C J.T.D. at the trial.\nThe action was brought against the Law Society of Alberta for a declaration that the plaintiff is still a member of the Society and is entitled to practise as a barrister and solicitor, and for damages for causing the plaintiff's name to be struck off the rolls of the Society. By the judgment at trial it was ordered and adjudged that the resolution passed by the Benchers of the Law Society of Alberta on July 5, 1923, whereby the plaintiff's name was struck from off the rolls of the Society, and the striking of his name from off the rolls, were null and void; that he was entitled to have his name restored to the rolls in the same condition and for all the same purpose and effect as if it had never been removed or struck off on July 5, 1923; that plaintiff has been ever since, and including, July 5, 1923, and is still a member of the Society, and entitled to practise as a barrister and solicitor; and that he recover from the defendant $1,500 (damages), and costs.\nBy the judgment of the Appellate Division the plaintiff's action was dismissed, and defendant was given costs of the appeal and in the Trial Division.\nThe plaintiff was given by the Appellate Division special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe question involved was the validity and effect of the proceedings which led to plaintiff's name being, and by which it was, struck off the rolls of the Society. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Rinfret J. now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the plaintiff's appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the trial Judge restored, with the modification that plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages against the defendant; the plaintiff to have costs of his appeal to this Court and his costs in the trial Court, but the defendant to have its costs of appeal to the Appellate Division.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nA. MacLeod Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur with the judgment of my brother Rinfret.\nIt is clear, I think, that the authority of the Benchers to order the name of a member to be struck from the rolls is conditioned upon a report by the Discipline Committee, recommending that that should be done, having been before the Benchers and considered by them (s. 32(2)). By the same subsection it is the Discipline Committee which, primarily, has the responsibility of dealing with and investigating charges and complaints regarding members of the Society. And if the Committee considers that the evidence warrants a recommendation to the Benchers that the member implicated shall be struck from the rolls, the next step is a report by the Discipline Committee containing such a recommendation. A Discipline Committee in being, therefore a decision by that Committee, a recommendation by it, would appear to be essential before an order striking a name from the roll can be validly made by the Benchers.\nAt the pertinent time, the Committee consisted of all the Benchers. I think it is plain that this Committee, which was the only Discipline Committee, never investigated the charges against the appellant. Three gentlemen were named by the Chairman of the Committee to perform this duty and these three gentlemen reported as the Discipline Committee to the Benchers; and it was upon this report that the Benchers acted.\nNow, I should not wish to be understood as intimating that the procedure of the Discipline Committee must conform to the rules that would prevail if they constituted a court of justice. I have no doubt that the Discipline Committee, in ascertaining the facts, may proceed through the agency of one or more of its members for the purpose of taking evidence and getting the facts. Nevertheless, in deciding upon their recommendation, the Discipline Committee, by force of subsection 7, must give the member charged an opportunity of appearing before them and presenting his defence.\nAs it is the Committee as a whole, or a proper quorum of it, which is to make the recommendation upon which the Benchers may act, the member concerned is obviously entitled to appear before the Committee, at a meeting properly convened, to deal with the charges against him. The appellant was not heard before any such meeting.\nAt first sight it might appear to be rather pedantic to draw a distinction between the Benchers and the Discipline Committee who consisted of the same persons. It may become, however, matter of substance in the strict sense when, as here, the essential step prescribed by the statute just mentioned, giving notice to the accused member and an opportunity of being heard before a properly convened meeting of the Benchers in their capacity of Discipline Committee, has been omitted. The rule of law is correctly stated, I think, in Craies' Statute Law, at p. 355, in this sentence:\n* * * when a statute confers jurisdiction upon a tribunal of limited authority and statutory origin, the conditions and qualifications annexed to the grant must be strictly complied with.\nThe authority of the Benchers, as well as that of the Discipline Committee, rests in its entirety upon the statute; and the authority of the Benchers, as already intimated, to make an order pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee is conditioned upon a recommendation by the Committee after a proper hearing. There is no authority given to the Benchers to consider a charge against a member except upon such a recommendation by the Committee. It follows that the appellant is entitled to a declaration that the order striking him off the roll is made without authority and that his name should be restored.\nI am disposed to think that, if the appellant had been heard by the Benchers in his defence in convocation, the report of the Committee, notwithstanding the form of the proceedings, might have been considered as adopted by the Benchers, sitting as a Discipline Committee, after hearing the appellant as the statute requires; and that the proceedings might have been considered as conforming in substance to the statutory procedure.\nIn the procedure actually followed, however, it is impossible to say that the appellant was given an opportunity of exercising his statutory right to appear before the Discipline Committee and present his defence. That is a defect in substantialibus, a defect that sterilizes the proceedings as regards legal consequences.\nAs to the right of appeal, it presupposes a decision by the Discipline Committee as well as by the Benchers. The Benchers are not in the position of a tribunal such as a Superior Court, which has (speaking generally) jurisdiction to decide finally, subject to appeal, upon any question touching its own jurisdiction (In re Padstow Total Loss and Collision Assce. Ass'n.[2]. Its decision upon that question \u2014the question of its own jurisdiction\u2014is necessarily reviewable collaterally for the purpose of determining whether or not it is operative in law in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary. The provision in the statute giving a right of appeal neither expressly nor by implication negatives this right. These matters in themselves have been fully dealt with by my brother Rinfret in a manner with which I entirely concur; I have adverted to them solely as introductory to what I have to say on the subject of the claim for damages.\nThe determination of that branch of the appeal is, I think, governed by the decision in Partridge's case. That case came before the Court of Appeal on two occasions; first, (ex Parte Partridge)[3] in an appeal from the Queen's Bench Division who had granted a mandamus against the General Council of Medical Education requiring the restoration of the name of Partridge to the Dentists Register from which, it was alleged, it had been illegally erased. The appeal failed.\nThe Council was invested by statute with power to erase a name from the register by section 13 of the Dentists Act; and, by section 15, the procedure in such cases was prescribed. By section 13, the Council was empowered to erase any entry which had been fraudulently or incorrectly made. Partridge's name had been properly entered upon the register. They also had authority under that section to erase the name of a dentist convicted of crime or found guilty of infamous or disgraceful conduct in a professional respect; and by section 15 it was provided that for the purpose of exercising this power they must \"ascertain the facts * * * by a Committee,\" and that as to the facts the report of the Committee should be final. The proper committee reported upon the facts.\nThe facts reported were that Partridge's diploma had been withdrawn by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on the ground that, in violation of an undertaking by him, he had resorted to advertising. On this report the Council directed the name to be erased.\nThe Council, before directing the erasure of Partridge's name, did not call upon him or give him an opportunity for an explanation and did not find that any of the conditions had arisen under which alone they were entitled to take such action.\nIn these circumstances, as already mentioned, it was held that Partridge's name had been erased without legal authority, and a mandamus requiring its restoration was granted. Partridge then brought an action for damages against the Council, alleging that they had unlawfully and maliciously removed his name from the register. The trial judge, Huddleston B., acquitted the Council of the charge of malice and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal (Partridge v. The General Council of Medical Education)[4] dismissed the appeal from this judgment on the ground that, since the power to erase a name from the register under section 13 was not a ministerial but a judicial power, and the Council having intended to act, and believed they were acting, in exercise of their powers under the statute, no action would lie in the absence of malice. The Master of the Rolls said:[5]\nIt appears to me that a body such as the defendants can only be made subject to an action for things which they have done erroneously without malice in carrying out their duties under the Act, if it can be shewn that they were acting merely ministerially * * * They seem to me all to shew that such an action as this cannot be maintained except where the duty intended to be exercised is only ministerial.\nNow, it must be observed that the error committed by the Council was not merely an error of fact, it was an error of law. They had been erroneously advised as to their powers under the statute. Nevertheless, acting, as they conceived themselves to be acting, in exercise of the discretionary power conferred upon them in the public interest and acting bona fide, they were not liable to an action. Fry L.J. says, at p. 98:\nThe conclusion I arrive at upon the facts is that the council, desiring, as I have said, to do their duty under the Act in this case, thought that the register must in such a case automatically follow the qualification in Ireland, and, when that was withdrawn, the register must be corrected accordingly; and that, that being so, they had power to order such correction by giving a special direction under s. 11. In that view they were wrong; but they were, as it seems to me, in making that error exercising a discretion. They were doing what they thought right in the exercise of the discretionary power given them over the register by the statute.\nLopes L.J. says (pp. 98-99):\nIt must be taken, I think, that the defendants acted bona fide and without malice, but that they improperly erased the name of the plaintiff from the register. They acted honestly, but they made a mistake in their mode of proceeding. They thought, as it appears to me, that, without calling on the plantiff for an explanation, they were justified in erasing his name from the register, because the qualification in Ireland had been withdrawn which originally entitled him to be placed on the register. The question is whether an action can, under those circumstances, be maintained against them for what they did. It is not disputed that the defend- ants ware performing a public duty; and that they intended to act under the statute. The point contested was whether they were in fact acting judicially or merely ministerially in what they did. If they were acting under s. 13, it cannot be disputed that they were acting judicially. But it is said that they were acting under s. 11 alone; and that acting under that section they were acting only ministerially. I will not refer to s. 11 at length. The effect of the section is that the council have power to give special directions to the registrar to which he is bound to conform. That being so, they have, in my opinion a discretion as to the directions they should give, and, therefore, in giving such directions they are acting judicially. The result is, as it seems to me, that whether they were acting under s. 13 or s. 11 only, they were acting judicially, and, as they were so acting and they acted without malice, according to the cases the action is not maintainable.\nI cannot find any distinction in substance between Partridge's case6 and that now presented to us for decision. The Benchers obviously acted under an erroneous view either of the facts or the law; probably as to the facts. It is unlikely that they had present to their minds the fact that they as a whole constituted the Discipline Committee: in any event, it is certain that they assumed the three gentlemen on whose report they acted to be in some way qualified to investigate the complaint and to report upon it as the Discipline Committee. Obviously, they acted in entire good faith. The error of substance, as I have said (which was present in Partridge's case6, was in not giving the appellant a hearing before all the Benchers at convocation when the report was considered. That error was the natural consequence of the assumption that the three gentlemen who had heard the appellant were invested with the functions of the Discipline Committee.\nConsistently with Partridge's case[6], the respondents cannot be held liable in an action for damages.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal is the validity of the proceedings taken against the appellant before the Benchers of the Law Society of Alberta, the appellant having been by resolution declared unworthy to practise as a lawyer, and he having been disbarred.\nIn 1923, the appellant was a member of the Law Society of Alberta. Complaints were made against him by several of his clients that he had rendered himself guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and were lodged with the secretary of the society. The secretary brought these complaints to the knowledge of Mr. Geo. H. Ross, K.C. as Chairman of the Discipline Committee, stating that it became necessary for him to \"select a Committee and appoint a date for the sitting of same.\"\nThereupon, Mr. Ross, of his own initiative, appointed three Benchers to examine into the complaints, receive evidence thereon and report.\nThe three Benchers so appointed met together on certain dates, after having notified the solicitors for the complainants and the present appellant; they proceeded to inquire into the complaints; they received evidence thereon in the presence of the appellant, who was given full opportunity to cross-examine and to adduce evidence on his own behalf \u2014and who availed himself of the opportunity.\nThe three Benchers then reported to the Convocation that they had found the charges or complaints proven; that the appellant had been guilty of improper professional conduct; and they recommended that the Convocation strike the name of the appellant from the rolls of the Society. This recommendation was received, accepted, approved and adopted by the Convocation on the 5th of July, 1923; it was further recorded that the appellant was found to have been guilty of improper professional conduct; and it was ordered that his name be, and the same was, struck off the rolls.\nThe appellant did not appeal from the recommendation of the three Benchers who heard the complaints and evidence, nor from the decision of the Convocation. On the contrary, on February 29, 1924, on July 6, 1926, and again on July 5, 1927, and still later, on October 31, 1930, the appellant applied for reinstatement as a member of the Law Society. The applications of 1924, 1926 and 1927 were refused. The application of 1930 was referred to an investigating committee which went into the matter very minutely and made an elaborate report recommending that the application should be granted and the name of the appellant should be restored to the rolls; but the recommendation of the committe does not appear to have been entertained by the Benchers in Convocation. As a matter of fact, the appellant then (since January 10, 1928) had already entered suit against the respondent, alleging that his name had wrongfully, and without legal right, been struck off the rolls of the Law Society, and praying for a declaration that he was still a member of the Society, entitled to practise as a barrister and solicitor before the courts of Alberta, and to exercise and enjoy all the rights and privileges of a barrister and solicitor; and also claiming damages for the loss of remuneration, at the rate of $500 per year, for all the years that had already elapsed or that would elapse before final determination of this action.\nThe defence was that the appellant had been properly and rightfully disbarred, and that, at all events, by his conduct, he had waived all irregularities, he had acquiesced in the decision of the Benchers and he was estopped from disputing its validity.\nThe Supreme Court of Alberta (Simmons C.J.) declared that the resolution passed by the Benchers of the Law Society of Alberta in Convocation on the 5th day of July, 1923, was absolutely null and void; that the appellant was entitled to have his name restored to the rolls of the Society \"in the same condition and for all the same purpose and effect as if the same had never been removed \"; that the appellant was and \"has been ever since, and including, the 5th day of July, 1923, and is still a member of the Law Society of Alberta, and entitled to practise as a barrister and solicitor * * * and to exercise and enjoy all rights and privileges of a barrister and solicitor;\" and that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent the sum of $1,500 with costs.\nThe Appellate Division, however, reversed this judgment on the ground that the resolution of the Benchers striking off the appellant from the rolls was not void, but merely voidable; that a special remedy, viz., an appeal to the Court of Appeal in the province, was provided for by the statute, of which the appellant had failed to avail himself; that such remedy was exclusive in the circumstances; and that, moreover, the appellant, \"after knowledge of the defect of the proceedings before the Benchers, instead of questioning their validity, had, in effect, acquiesced in them by his applications for restoration to the rolls, not on the ground of his name having been improperly removed therefrom, but through the indulgence of the Benchers.\"\nBy order of the Appellate Division of Alberta, the appellant was granted special leave to appeal to this Court.\nAs must have appeared from the foregoing statement of the facts and of the reasons in the courts of Alberta, the result of the appeal turns upon the question whether the proceedings had before the Benchers of the Law Society were absolutely void, as found by the trial judge, or merely voidable, as held by the Appellate Division.\nIn order to decide the point, reference must first be made to the Legal Profession Act, being chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922, as it stood at the material dates.\nUnder that statute, which applies to the respondent, the Society is governed by a body composed of some of its members designated Benchers (sec. 7).\nIt is the duty of the Benchers, from time to time, to appoint and maintain a committee of their own body, to be known as the Discipline Committee, consisting of at least three members. The Benchers may alter the number, the constitution and the tenure of office of such committee (sec. 32(1)). Then comes subsection 2 of section 32 of the Act, which ought to be quoted in full:\n(2) The discipline committee shall deal with and may investigate every written charge or complaint against or regarding any member of the society who has been convicted of an indictable offence, or who is known or reported to be guilty of or who is charged with dishonourable, disgraceful, infamous, unbecoming, improper or criminal conduct, professional or otherwise; and if the committee considers the charge or complaint warrants it may recommend that the benchers strike the name of the said member from the rolls, and the benchers may order the same to be done.\nThe other subsections of section 32 deal with the result of a decision ordering that the name of a member should be struck from the roll. They empower the benchers, in the alternative, merely to reprimand or to suspend an offending member, or to order that he should pay a penalty.\nThen, subsections 6 to 12 deal with the procedure that must be followed before the discipline committee in the investigation of a charge or complaint against a member of the society. The committee may have such legal or other assistance as it may think necessary, and so may the member whose conduct is the subject of the inquiry have the right to be represented by counsel or agent. The discipline committee\nmay meet to take evidence or otherwise ascertain the facts concerning any such complaint or charge, but notice in writing of any such meeting shall be served personally or in such other manner as may be ordered by a judge of the Supreme Court, upon the member whose conduct is the subject of enquiry, at least two weeks before the time fixed for such meeting, setting out the written charge or complaint with such particulars as may be necessary to inform the person charged or complained of fully of the substance and effect of the charge or complaint against him, and specifying the time and place of such meeting (subsec. 7).\nThere are provisions for procuring the compulsory attendance of witnesses, for the taking under oath of their testimony, for \"cross-examination of all witnesses called, with the right to adduce evidence in defence and reply\"; and it is stated that\nthe rules of evidence on such enquiry and the proceedings and penalties in the case of disobedience shall be the same as obtain in civil cases in the Supreme Court.\nThe discipline committee is empowered to proceed with the subject-matter of the enquiry in the absence of the member whose conduct is challenged or complained of, upon proof of personal service, or of such substituted service as may have been ordered, of the notice to the said member, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nWe think the provisions dealing with the right of appeal from the decision of the discipline committee and of the benchers should be quoted verbatim, in view of the opinion based upon those provisions expressed by some of the Judges of the Appellate Division:\n(1) Any member, whose name has been ordered to be struck from the rolls or who has been ordered to be suspended under the powers hereby conferred, may appeal from the decision of the committee and of the benchers to the said Appellate Division or such other Court as may from time to time exercise the functions of a Court of Appeal in the Province, at any time within six months after the date of the order complained of, or within such further time as a judge of the Appellate Division shall allow, and such Court may, upon hearing said appeal, make such order, either confirming the action of the said committee and the benchers or varying or reversing the same or for further enquiries by the committee and the benchers or otherwise and as to costs as may to it seem meet.\n(2) The said appeal shall be by notice in writing to the benchers to show cause, which said notice shall be served not less than ten days before the hearing thereof, and shall be founded upon a copy of the proceedings before the said committee and the benchers, the evidence taken, the committee's report and the order made by the benchers thereon.\n(3) The secretary of the society shall upon the request of any member desiring so to appeal, furnish to such member a certified copy of such proceedings, report, order and papers without expense.\nBut before we proceed to examine the particular provisions of the statute above referred to and to apply them to the circumstances of the present case, a few additional facts must be adverted to:\nIn obedience to the Act, the benchers of the Law Society of Alberta had, on the 4th January, 1923, appointed Mr. Geo. H. Ross, K.C. as chairman and all the other benchers as members of the discipline committee.\nThe resolution appointing them was still in force throughout the proceedings had before the specially selected committee of three benchers appointed by Mr. Geo. H. Ross to investigate the charges against the appellant and also at the time when the benchers adopted the recommendation and made the order to strike off the rolls the name of the appellant.\nThe three benchers who inquired into the charges made against the appellant were not appointed as a discipline committee, but were selected by Mr. Ross as a special committee.\nThe members of the discipline committee appointed on the 4th of January, 1923, and still in existence at the time of the investigation into the complaints against the appellant, were never notified of the charge, nor called upon to inquire into them and to deal with them as members of the discipline committee.\nMr. Ross, duly appointed chairman of the discipline committee, did not sit on the investigating committee, nor was he called upon to do so.\nThe only report, or recommendation, made to the benchers upon the charges against the appellant, came from the special committee, and none was ever made by the discipline committee.\nThe appellant had no knowledge of the fact that the special investigating committee before which he appeared was not the official discipline committee. He was made aware of that fact only in 1925.\nUpon those facts, the question is whether the proceedings now in question were absolutely void, or only voidable, and what were the rights of the appellant after he found out the irregularities to which he had been submitted?\nThe Legal Professional Act, the essential parts of which we have outlined, and more particularly the sections of the Act we have quoted as bearing directly upon the matters at issue, show that the Law Society of Alberta, or the benchers of that society, are not vested with a general and unqualified control of the members of the Society in respect of any \"dishonourable, disgraceful, infamous, unbecoming, improper or criminal conduct, professional or otherwise\" with which they are charged, or of which they may be found guilty. It is important to keep in mind, therefore, that we are not dealing with a body invested with the plenary authority of a common law court, but a body to which has been given only limited statutory authority. The authority which is given to the benchers is such that it may not be exercised without the conjunctive co-operation of another body, which is the discipline committee. It is really so that the two bodies must act in order properly to deal with charges or complaints of a nature to entail the striking of the name of a member from the rolls and his consequent disbarment. One body may not act without the other and the action of one alone is insufficient to obtain the required result in conformity with the statute and consistently with the authority there conferred.\nThis is rendered still clearer by the provision dealing with the right of appeal to the Appellate Division and whereby the appeal is contemplated \"from the decision of the committee and of the benchers.\" It may even be pointed out that the power and duty to investigate the charge or complaint is delegated, not to the benchers, but to the discipline committee; and it is only upon the recommendation of that committee that the benchers are authorized to order the consequential disbarment. The authority to make the order is not given the benchers, except upon the recommendation of the discipline committee.\nIn this case, the discipline committee, though in existence, never dealt with or investigated any charge or complaint; nor was there any recommendation from that committee. Further, although an investigation was not the province of the benchers, at all events, no investigation is proven to have been made by them; and they merely adopted the recommendation of a committee appointed by Mr. Geo. H. Ross and for the existence of which no provision appears in the statute.\nIt is to no purpose to argue that the official discipline committee, as originaly appointed in the premises, comprised all the benchers who eventually received and adopted the recommendation of the special committee. Quite apart from the circumstance that the benchers who were present at the meeting when that report was adopted had, in fact, made no investigation of their own, the statute clearly provides for two distinctive bodies: the discipline committee and the benchers; and each body is given separate and distinct duties to perform.\nOn the charges made against the appellant, only one body acted; and that body was not empowered to act alone\u2014 indeed, it had no power to enter into the case at all until after the other body had previously acted. It follows that, in our view, the trial judge was right in treating the order made by the benchers alone as an absolute nullity and completely void of any operative effect. It was not only an erroneous decision, still less a decision only affected by procedural irregularities or mere absence of machinery; it was a decision given where there was no authority to give it.\nThe benchers simply could not make the order without the anterior investigation and recommendation of the discipline committee. The report on which the order of the benchers was founded was not even that of a sub-committee appointed by the benchers among themselves; it was the report of three benchers named without authority by Mr. Geo. H. Ross, and who had no power to deal with the matter in the way it was done. As pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, the appellant was deprived of the undoubted right he possessed \"to make his full defence before the statutory body which then had power to hear his case, to wit: the discipline committee composed of all the benchers at that time.\"\nHe never had a chance to explain or vindicate himself before the discipline committee; and each of the members of the discipline committee, or, in the circumstances, each of the benchers, was not given the opportunity, which he was bound to have, of fulfilling the duty of weighing the evidence for or against the appellant.\nWe, therefore, think the order of the benchers of the 5th July, 1923, was made outside the scope of the powers of the benchers. As such, it was completely null, and not only voidable.\nAs a consequence, this was not a case where the appellant ought to have availed himself of the provisions of the statute in respect to appeal. In the first place, there was no recommendation of the discipline committee from which he could appeal; and, besides, the order of the benchers was a nullity and deprived of any conclusive effect (Toronto Railway Company v. Corporation of the City of. Toronto[7]).\nNor could the situation be rectified by waiver, or consent, on the part of the appellant. There could be no effective consent on that point while the proceedings were going on and up to the time when the order was made by the benchers, for the appellant was not then aware of the fact that he had not been called before the discipline committee. On the contrary, the circumstances rather led him to believe that he was before the regular body. It was only in 1925 that he was put in possession of information which suggested in his own mind some question of the validity of the investigation and of the order made against him.\nNever in any of his applications for reinstatement did he raise the question of the validity of the proceedings. Certainly he never indicated any express intention of waiving any rights that he had; and he cannot be taken to have abandoned his rightful objections to the validity of the proceedings and of the order.\nBut moreover and in point of law, the lack of power in the benchers deprived the order of any effect, and particularly since a question of this kind may not be treated as a mere private matter and the legislation we are now considering is, to a large extent, intended for the protection of the general public and must be looked at from the viewpoint of public interest, we do not think estoppel on the ground of acquiescence can be invoked here by the respondent. The defence on this line of reasoning, therefore, fails; and the judgment of the trial court declaring that the resolution passed by the benchers, whereby the name of the appellant was struck from the rolls, is now and always was null and void, and that the appellant is entitled to have his name restored to the rolls, ought to stand.\nWe may add that the case of Hands vs. The Law Society of Upper Canada[8], much relied on at the argument, does not help the respondent. In that case, the questions in dispute turned upon the failure to observe some requirements of procedure, while, in the present case, the appellant was not called before the proper forum, and the statutory-body pretending to deal with the whole matter was not legally constituted.\nBut, in addition to declaring that the resolution of the benchers was absolutely null, that the appellant was still a member of the Law Society of Alberta, entitled to practice as a barrister and solicitor and to exercise and enjoy all rights and privileges as such, the Court ordered that the appellant do recover from the respondent the sum of $1,500 damages.\nWe do not think, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent is liable in damages.\nWe say nothing of the fact that the claim was brought by the appellant, not against the benchers who formed the special committee, or against the whole of the benchers acting in convocation, but against the Law Society of Alberta, for the Society undoubtedly adopted the order as its own. The Society acted upon it. The name of the appellant was struck from the rolls and he was effectively prevented from practising his profession. Before the courts, the Society undertook to defend the act of the benchers and no question was raised as to its full responsibility therefor.\nOf course, the learned Chief Justice very properly refused to allow damages as from the date when the appellant acquired knowledge of the facts leading to the invalidity of the order; but, in our view, the act of the benchers was not such as would entail any liability in damages of the Law Society. The learned judge found that the benchers acted without malice. He said:\nThe evidence is quite convincing, from my viewpoint, that the benchers themselves thought that a committee had a right to hear the evidence and make a report to the benchers. I am satisfied that is what was done in this case. I am satisfied that they heard the evidence and made what they believed an honest report on the evidence. In fact, I may go a little further and say that I am satisfied that if the whole of the benchers had heard the evidence they might have reached the same conclusion.\nIt is obvious that the benchers were acting in good faith. They were only \"endeavouring to do their duty to the public and the profession\" Now, provided they take the proper course, and within the conditions specified by the statute, the benchers have the power to order the striking of the name of a member from the rolls of the Society. In the exercise of those powers, they perform a function not merely ministerial, but discretionary and judicial.\nLike the trial judge, we are convinced, upon all the circumstances disclosed in the record, that the benchers honestly believed they were adopting the report of a properly constituted committee; they \"were intending in what they did to do what they were entitled to do, viz., to perform the public duties imposed upon them by the Act.\" They gave the order in what they bona fide believed to be the exercise of a judicial discretion, and they, or the Law Society which they represent, are not subject to an action in damages, because the report which they adopted as the foundation of their order happened, without their actual knowledge, to lack authority and validity. On this point, this case comes within the rule laid down in Partridge v. General Council of Medical Education[9].\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge shall be restored with the modification that the appellant will not be entitled to recover from the respondent the sum of $1,500.\nThe appellant should have his costs of the appeal to this Court. However, in view of the partial success of the respondent in obtaining the modification of the judgment of the trial Court in respect of damages, the respondent must have its costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, but it should pay the appellant's costs in the trial Court, including the costs of the examination for discovery.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\n[1] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 735; [1935] 2 D.L.R. 583.\n[2] (1882) 20 Ch.D. 137.\n[3] (1887) 19 Q.B.D. 467.\n[4] (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 90.\n[5] 25 Q.B.D. at 96.\n6\n6 25 Q.B.D. 90.\n[6] 25 Q.B.D. 90.\n[7] [1904] A.C. 809.\n[8] (1888) 16 Ont.

It was of a design unique on this continent and of difficult work. The defendant surety company gave its bond to plaintiffs, guaranteeing performance by B. The time for completion under the contract was May 15, 1931. The building was completed by August 13, 1931, on which date the architect\u2019s final certificate was issued. There had been, and continued to be, leakages of rain into the building, which plaintiffs alleged were due to faulty workmanship and B. alleged were due to faulty design. On September 28, 1931, plaintiffs paid the balance of the contract price (which, by arrangement, was paid direct to unpaid sub-contractors), after obtaining on that date from B. a written undertaking as follows: \u201cI hereby acknowledge having received notice from you and your architect * * * that certain defects have been discovered by your architect, and that there is water leaking into the church * * *, the cause of which has not been exactly determined. * * * I hereby acknowledge that the said notice has been given to me in pursuance of the specifications which form part of the contract * * *. I further agree and covenant to repair same according to the directions given by your architect.\u201d The undertaking as drawn by plaintiffs had contained, after said words \u201cto repair same,\u201d the words \u201caccording to the terms of the contract,\u201d but as B. (who denied faulty performance by him) would not sign it in that form, the latter words were deleted. Article 16 of the general conditions in the specifications read as follows: \u201cNeither the final certificate or payment * * * shall relieve the contractor from responsibility for faulty materials or workmanship, which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of completion of the work, and he shall remedy any defect due thereto and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom which shall appear within such period of one year, but beyond that the contractor shall not be liable. * * * \u201d\nPlaintiffs sued B. and the surety, claiming for damages resulting from the leakages. At trial they obtained judgment against both defendants. B.\u2019s appeal from this judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which, however, allowed the surety\u2019s appeal and dismissed the action as against it. B. and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld (per the majority of the Court: Duff C.J., Crocket and Davis JJ.): (1) In view of the issue of the architect\u2019s final certificate and payment of the full amount of the contract moneys, and there being no suggestion of fraud or mistake, the question of B.\u2019s liability must be confined to his said undertaking of September 28, and said article 16 (being the only relevant reservation in the contract available to plaintiffs, once the work was completed and accepted, the final certificate issued and the contract moneys paid).\n(2) B.\u2019s obligation under his undertaking of September 28 was limited to obeying directions of the architect; and in the absence of proof that directions were given and not obeyed, B. was not liable under the undertaking.\n(3) B.\u2019s responsibility under article 16 was limited to faulty materials or workmanship which did not \u201cappear\u201d until after the completion and acceptance of the work. Assuming (what plaintiffs contended) that B. had not properly bonded the bricks and tiles with the mortar, yet article 16 must be read in the light of the necessity for the architect\u2019s constant supervision of this particular work (the bricklaying being a job of more than ordinary difficulty) and of the fact that there was no suggestion of bad faith or fraud or concealment on B.\u2019s part; (discussion of an architect\u2019s duties in such cases, and of the extent of a contractor\u2019s liability in damages if the architect fails to supervise properly and check defects and have them remedied as they occur); and if the defects complained of were such as the architect would observe if he gave the requisite supervision to the work, then it could not fairly be said that the defects were not apparent within the contemplation of article 16 before the completion and acceptance of the work. The date of the \u201cappearance\u201d of faulty workmanship or materials (if any) was important; and the case against B. had not really been dealt with, at trial, from that point of view. Further, if there was liability upon B. under article 16, it rested upon plaintiffs to establish upon a proper measure of damages what were in fact the actual damages; and the evidence was not such as could establish that. The principle of measuring damages on the basis of the cost of repairing the (building as it stood at the date of the trial (February, 1934) was clearly wrong, quite apart from the very unsatisfactory nature of the evidence adduced even on that basis. It was impossible to say from the evidence whether any liability had been incurred under article 16.\n(4) For reasons aforesaid, the judgment against B. should be set aside; with liberty to plaintiffs to proceed to a new trial on the issue arising out of article 16.\n(5) The action as against the surety should be dismissed. Acts of the plaintiffs in connection with the contract (anticipatory payments, the arrangement aforesaid for payment direct to sub-contractors owing to B.\u2019s financial difficulties in completing the work, the settlement covered by said undertaking of September 28, etc.) which, under all the special circumstances of the case should have been, but were not, done with the knowledge and consent of the surety, operated to discharge the surety. (The law as to the effect of alterations in a contract as affecting a surety\u2019s liability, discussed, and Holme v. Brunskill, 3 Q.B.D. 495; Calvert v. London Dock Co., 2 Keen\u2019s Rep. 638, General Steam Navigation Co. v. Rolt, 6 C.B. (N.S.) 550, and other cases, referred to. Any agreement or transaction between the principals in variation of the contract without the surety\u2019s consent, unless it is self-evident that the variation is unsubstantial or necessarily beneficial to the surety, operates to discharge the surety. The application of this principle with regard to the circumstances of the present case discussed).\n(6) After B.\u2019s bid had been accepted, he notified plaintiffs that he had made two substantial omissions in estimating costs for the purpose of it, and requested release or an increased contract price, which plaintiffs refused. B., faced with threatened forfeiture of deposit and loss of materials on the site of the work, decided to proceed with the work. It was subsequent to this that the surety delivered its bond in the blanket form in which plaintiffs required it. When these facts had come out at the trial (which had then proceeded for a week) counsel for the surety asked leave to plead non-disclosure thereof by plaintiffs to the surety and consequent release of the surety, which request was refused except on terms of adjournment and payment by the surety in any event of all costs of the trial up to that time, which latter term was declined. The majority of this Court expressed the opinion that under all the circumstances the surety should have been allowed to amend its pleadings unfettered by such an onerous term as to costs; and that, had judgment not been given for dismissal, on other grounds, of the action against it, a new trial would have been necessary to determine the issue sought to be raised. The questions involved in such an issue were to some extent discussed.\nPer Rinfret J. (dissenting in part): The trial judge\u2019s finding that leakages were attributable to faulty workmanship of B. which did not \u201cappear\u201d until within one year after the completion of the work, within the contemplation of article 16, was fully warranted on the evidence. But in any case the undertaking of September 28, 1931, created a new and independent obligation on B., which was not qualified by restrictions in article 16, to repair the defects; and directions within the meaning of said undertaking were given by the architect. The judgment against B. should be affirmed. But said undertaking of September 28 was a material alteration in the contract, and the surety was thereby released of its liability under its bond, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the action as against it should be affirmed. Per Kerwin J. (dissenting): Upon the evidence, the trial judge\u2019s findings against B. should not be interfered with. The leaks arose through B.\u2019s failure to comply with the specifications. The conditions in the building shortly before the trial of the action, shewn in evidence, were, upon the evidence, substantially unchanged from those existing within a year after completion of the building; and the defects had arisen within that year. There was ample justification for the amount fixed as damages by the trial judge. Directions were given to B. to repair, within the meaning of the undertaking of September 28. The judgment against B. should be affirmed. As to the surety\u2019s liability:\u2014Having regard to article 16 (aforesaid), and to other terms in the contract which (inter alia) required the work to be done in accordance with the plans, drawings, etc., and such \u201cinstructions as may from time to time be given\u201d by the architect, the undertaking of September 28 did not subject B. to anything more onerous than had been required by the contract; it did not effect any change in the contract; nor, consequently, any release of the surety. As to B.\u2019s alleged mistake in omitting to estimate certain costs for the purpose of his bid (even assuming the point was now open to the surety): there was no obligation on plaintiffs to notify the surety thereof; there was no charge of fraud or misrepresentation nor any suggestion that it occurred to plaintiffs or the architect to withhold the information as something of which the surety should be apprised; the error was not such a circumstance the mere non-disclosure of which would release the surety. As to certain matters which occurred during the work\u2014including B.\u2019s financial difficulties and the arrangement for making payment to sub-contractors\u2014they did not give rise to any obligation on plaintiffs to notify the surety thereof. There was no alteration in the terms of the contract; nor was the surety prejudiced. The judgment at trial against the surety should be restored.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs and appeal by the defendant Blonde from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe defendant Blonde contracted with the plaintiffs to erect for them a church building at Windsor, Ontario. The defendant The Canadian Surety Company gave its bond to the plaintiffs as security for payment of any loss or damage directly arising by reason of the failure of Blonde faithfully to perform the contract.\nThe action was brought to recover from the defendants damages for alleged faulty performance of the work by Blonde. At trial, Hope J. gave judgment against both defendants for $19,173.25 and a further sum of $330 against Blonde. Both defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which (by a majority in each case) dismissed Blonde\u2019s appeal but allowed the appeal of The Canadian Surety Company (for dismissal of the action as against it). The plaintiffs appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it allowed The Cana- dian Surety Company\u2019s appeal, and the defendant Blonde appealed to this Court from the judgment against him.\nThe material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote.\nS.L. Springsteen K.C. and A. Racine K.C. for the plaintiffs (appellants).\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and A.E. Knox for the defendant (respondent) The Canadian Surety Company.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. for the defendant (appellant) Blonde.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff C.J., Crocket and Davis JJ.) was delivered by\nDAVIS, J.\u2014This is a building contract case. The defendant Blonde entered into a contract in writing with the plaintiffs to erect a church building in Windsor, Ont., and the defendant, Canadian Surety Company, gave its bond to the plaintiffs guaranteeing the performance of the contract by Blonde. The building was in due course completed, the final certificate of the architect was issued and the then balance of the contract price was paid in full. The contract price was $88,500 and the surety bond was for half that amount. Though the building was completed on or before August 13, 1931, as found by the trial judge, it was not until April 5, 1933, that the plaintiffs commenced this action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against the contractor and the surety company claiming $44,695.15 damages for alleged negligence in construction. The trial judge gave judgment against both defendants in the sum of $19,173.25 and an additional sum of $330 against the contractor. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the judgment against the surety company was set aside and the action against it dismissed, but the judgment against the contractor was affirmed. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court against the judgment in favour of the surety company and the contractor Blonde appealed against the judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against him. The two appeals were heard together.\nThe case should have been a fairly simple one if the parties had directed themselves to the only issues that were properly open and had confined themselves to relevant evidence on those issues. As between the contractor and the plaintiffs, in the absence of fraud or mistake, neither of which was suggested here, the issue of the architect\u2019s final certificate and the payment of the full amount of the contract moneys put an end to the matter except in so far as any rights and liabilities of the parties to the contract were expressly reserved by the terms of the contract itself or by some agreement made between the parties at the time of the final payment. That was a fundamental principle that should have been recognized and applied at the very outset of the trial of the action. Had that been done, it would have become at once apparent that the evidence should have been focussed on two points: firstly, on a special undertaking in writing (Exhibit 25) obtained by the plaintiffs from the contractor before the final payment was made, and, secondly, on article 16 of the General Conditions, which reads as follows:\nNeither the final certificate or payment, nor any provision of the contract document shall relieve the contractor from responsibility for faulty materials or workmanship, which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of completion of the work, and he shall remedy any defect due thereto and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom which shall appear within such period of one year, but beyond that the contractor shall not be liable. The owner shall give notice of observed defects with reasonable promptness. Questions arising under this article shall be decided as provided in Articles 10 and 44.\nFirstly, then, the question is, what is the precise meaning of the written undertaking, and what, if any, liability arose under it? Secondly, what is the scope and extent of the reservation in article 16, and what, if any, liability arose under that article? The minds of those engaged at the trial of this action do not appear to have been focussed upon the fundamental points. The case was thrown wide open without regard to the fact that the building had been completed and accepted, the architect\u2019s final certificate issued and the contract moneys paid. The inevitable result was a mass of evidence that took thirteen days of the trial court at intervals during the months of January, February and March, 1934, and the vital points in the litigation were lost track of. Lord Tomlin (then Tomlin, J.) said in Graigola Merthyr Co. Ltd. v. Swansea Corporation[1]: Long cases produce evils; * * * In every case of this kind there are generally many \u201cirreducible and stubborn facts\u201d upon which agreement between experts should be possible, and in my judgment the expert advisers of the parties, whether legal or scientific, are under a special duty to the Court in the preparation of such a case to limit in every possible way the contentious matters of fact to be dealt with at the hearing. That is a duty which exists notwithstanding that it may not always be easy to discharge.\nAs far as the contractor\u2019s liability was concerned, there were only the two \u201cirreducible and stubborn\u201d points in the case. Firstly, was there any breach by the contractor of his written undertaking (Exhibit 25), and if so, what was the amount of damages; and secondly, did \u201cfaulty materials or workmanship\u201d in the sense in which those words are used in article 16 \u201cappear within the period of one year from the date of the completion of the work,\u201d and if so, the amount of the damages.\nBefore discussing these points in detail, it is convenient to mention here that it was \u201ca very original design\u201d for a church and \u201cit was difficult brick work,\u201d in the words of the architect himself. The centre section of the church was a twelve-sided figure and the ornamentation for the building was in the brickwork itself. There appears to have been nothing like this design on this continent, though there is a considerable amount in northern Europe. Mathers, an experienced Toronto architect, said\nthat the whole of the masonry work on that particular building would require very close supervision. I know I would be most interested in how it was done. I would want to take a hand in it\u2014almost become the foreman on the job.\nHaving regard to the climatic conditions in western Ontario, it is evident that it was a bold move to attempt this extreme type of architectural construction there, and that those who undertook it were bound to give very close supervision to the masonry work during the progress of the work. The contract was taken at a very low figure by a man nearly seventy\u2011five years of age who had built churches in many small towns, but was plainly without the skilled experience necessary to undertake the difficult work involved in the construction of this type of building.\nTurning now to the written undertaking (Exhibit 25) that the contractor gave to the plaintiffs in order to secure payment of the balance of the contract moneys. There had been considerable leakages of rain into the building before the completion and acceptance of the building and the plaintiffs sought to \u201csafeguard\u201d themselves by obtaining from the contractor, before handing over the balance of the contract moneys, a written undertaking as follows:\nI hereby acknowledge having received notice from you and your architect, Mr. Lothian, to the effect that certain defects have been discovered by your architect, and that there is water leaking into the church constructed by me, the cause of which has not been exactly determined.\nI hereby acknowledge having received notice from your architect and from you of same. I hereby acknowledge that the said notice has been given to me in pursuance of the specifications which form part of the contract entered into between you and myself. I further agree and covenant to repair same according to the terms of the contract according to the directions given by your architect, Mr. Lothian.\nDated at Windsor, Ontario, this 28th day of September, A.D. 1931.\nThe words in italics, \u201caccording to the terms of the contract,\u201d were deleted before the document was signed by the contractor. The solicitors for the plaintiffs had drafted the document, but the contractor had consistently taken the position that the leakages were not due to any failure on his part to perform the contract but were inherent in the architect\u2019s faulty design and inadequate structural specifications. He would not give an undertaking with the words, \u201caccording to the terms of the contract\u201d in it, and the plaintiffs finally accepted the undertaking from him without those words. There could be no misunderstanding of the position taken by the contractor. He was not affirming an obligation under the contract; he was undertaking a new obligation outside the contract. The court was entitled to definite evidence by the plaintiffs as to what directions, if any, were given by the architect, when they were given, and what, if any, failure in compliance therewith was made by the contractor. There is a singular dearth of evidence on this aspect of the case. Exhibit 36 is a letter from the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors to the contractor under date of March 2, 1932, in which they say:\nReferring to your letter of February 4, 1932, you mention in paragraph 2 of the said letter that the repair work has been done according to the instructions of Mr. Lothian. We have showed this letter to Mr. Lothian, and he has asked us to say that he gave no instructions to you as to how to make repairs. You have discussed the matter with him and he has only given suggestions, and not instructions.\nThis letter rather confirms the construction put upon the undertaking by counsel for the contractor that the undertaking necessarily involved the giving of future directions. The architect, Lothian, was asked in cross-examination:\nI understood you to say you simply went up there when Mr. Blonde was there, and only went there if there was further evidence of leaking. Am I right? to which he answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d There is really no evidence directed to show any breach by the contractor of his obligation under this written undertaking. We agree with what Mr. Justice Riddell said in the Court of Appeal:\nAs against Blonde, his obligation was to obey the direction of the architect; the architect swears that he did not give any directions; and the solicitors for the plaintiffs say so specifically in their letter of March 2, 1932. It seems to me that no action lies against Blonde on this undertaking unless and until it is proved that he omitted to obey a direction of Lothian.\nNow we turn to the reservation contained in article 16 of the General Conditions of the original contract itself. That is the only reservation in the contract (except article 28 respecting unpaid liens which are not involved in this case) available to the plaintiffs once the work was completed and accepted, the final certificate issued and the contract moneys paid. Very little precise evidence was directed to this provision. There are the most casual references here and there throughout the evidence to proof of the discovery of faulty materials or workmanship within the exact period of one year from the completion of the work, i.e., August 13, 1931. The plaintiffs did engage within the year two independent experts, one an architect and one an engineer, to examine the building and make a detailed report upon it, and this was done about February, 1932. The evidence discloses that these men made a careful and minute investigation and rendered a detailed report, but neither of these gentlemen was called at the trial nor was any part of their report disclosed. Instead of calling these men the plaintiffs called two expert witnesses from Montreal\u2014Macdonald, an architect, and Harrington, a contracting engineer, both capable, experienced men, but neither of them saw the building until the time of the trial, which did not commence till January, 1934. The real complaint that the plaintiffs advanced was that during rainstorms water leaked in through the building at different places and caused a great deal of damage. That the building was leaking before the final payment was made and that the plaintiffs feared a continuance of that condition is perfectly plain from the very language of the written undertaking (Exhibit 25) which the plaintiffs sought and obtained from the contractor before the final payment was made. That the building continued to leak thereafter is beyond dispute. Leakages appear to have broken out in different parts of the building. The evidence is that in August, 1932, the clerestory wall was torn down and it was then discovered, the architect says, that the difficulty was due to the contractor not having properly bonded the bricks and tiles with the mortar. If this could be treated in law as something which \u201cappeared\u201d during the year within the contemplation of article 16 rather than something which in the progress of construction should have been observed and condemned by the architect and the work stopped to insure the proper execution of the contract (clause 2 of the contract, and article 9 of the General Conditions), then one would have expected something more definite in the way of proof of the exact date of this alleged appearance having regard to the date of the completion of the work. There was a good deal of competent evidence, however, that there were two real causes of this leakage. Firstly, that the combination of hollow tile, brick and mortar was a very serious mistake in the construction specified by the contract, in that the combination of them was inherently bad because the hollow tile naturally absorbed the moisture from the mortar with great rapidity and therefore the combination should never have been used in the construction of the building. And, secondly, that there was no bracing of the steel work in the roof of this building. There was much competent and reliable evidence that in a building of this sort there should have been adequate steel bracing of the trusses in the roof of the building. There was evidence by several witnesses that when a person stood in the building on his toes and let his heels come down, the building shook, and, further, that the heavy motor traffic on the street caused the building to shake. All that was attributed to lack of specification of adequate steel work. In fact it was admitted by the architect, in reply, that in the choir loft this vibration was apparent, but he did not think the vibration was \u201cof a magnitude to endanger the building,\u201d Macdonald, in reply, said that he had noticed vibration in the choir gallery \u201cby rising on the toes and striking the floor with my heels.\u201d If the building shook from time to time because of passing motor traffic or of some slight movement inside the building itself, it is quite apparent that the building would crack here and there and that the cracks would increase with the passing of time and that rain water would very readily work itself into the building through the cracks and cause a progressive state of disturbance and damage. Those two problems, one the improper use of hollow tiles with brick and mortar, and the other the absence of bracing in the steel work, were vital matters in the case and deserved very special analysis and consideration, and we do not consider a bare finding of fact, inconsistent with these explanations of the causes of the trouble, presents any serious difficulty to a complete review of the evidence.\nBut assuming in favour of the plaintiffs that these cracks in the walls were caused by faulty masonry work of the contractor in not having properly bonded the bricks and tiles, is that \u201cfaulty materials or workmanship which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of completion of the work\u201d within the contemplation of article 16? Is that the sort of thing that was covered or intended to be covered by that provision in the contract reserving the rights of the owner? The effect of article 16 is plainly to limit the responsibility of the contractor to faulty materials or workmanship which do not appear until after the completion and acceptance of the work. Manifestly no remedy is preserved against the contractor after completion and acceptance of the work if the defects had appeared before that time. What constitutes an \u201cappearance\u201d is a matter of construction, and, to determine whether or not faulty materials or workmanship did appear, one must know the facts. If the work was done in the open and the architect in the ordinary course would see the work and the fault was of such a character that it must have been apparent to any competent architect observing the work, it could not be said that the fault was not apparent within the meaning of article 16 before the work was accepted and paid for. The failure of an architect to note what was before his eyes, or to realize the possible ultimate consequences, is really of no relevancy to the question whether or not the fault was apparent. Assuming, and it was the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, that the mortar was not properly laid and that that was the cause of the damages sought to be recovered, it was the duty of the architect to ascertain that at the time the mortar was being put into the building. Construction commenced about the middle of November, 1930, and by December 4 or 5 the architect had left for England and did not return till about January 7 or 8. It was the architect\u2019s duty to give close supervision to the construction. If he is now right in his contention that it was faulty masonry work and not defective design and specifications, that could have been observed and remedied during the progress of the building with very little, if any, expense or loss to any one. Architects are not required to do everything in the way of watching the construction of buildings under their charge, but they are required to give such care and attention to the work while it is in progress, as the nature and difficulties of the particular work reasonably demand. To check just such defects in masonry as it is suggested occurred during the progress of the work in this building was one of the very things under the special circumstances of this case that the architect was in duty bound to do. It was admittedly a bricklaying job of more than ordinary difficulty. Where an architect fails to do that which he ought to have done he may himself be liable to the owner for very large damages on the basis of the cost of tearing down and reconstructing that which may not become known to the owner for a very considerable time after the work is completed and at a time when the cost of remedying the defects has become very heavy, and yet the contractor himself may remain liable only for what it would have cost to have remedied those defects at the time they occurred had the architect done his duty and required the contractor then to remedy the faults. (Halsbury, 2nd ed., Vol. 3, pp. 277, 340 and 341.)\nArticle 16 must be read in the light of the necessity for the constant supervision of this particular work and of the fact that there is no suggestion of bad faith or fraud or concealment on the part of the contractor. If the defects now complained of were the sort of thing that the architect would observe if he gave the requisite supervision to the work, then it can not fairly be said that the defects were not apparent within the contemplation of article 16 before the completion and acceptance of the work.\nIf we can regard the physical conditions which permitted the water to leak through as in themselves constituting faults within article 16, then it is clear that they were apparent before the completion of the work. If it is said that the leaks themselves did not constitute faulty workmanship within the meaning of article 16 and that it was not until after the completion of the work that the fact that they were due to faulty workmanship was ascertained, the fact of the faulty workmanship to which they were ascribed appeared during the progress of the work. If, on the other hand, the leaks are to be treated as the consequences of the fault found by the trial judge (the failure to bind the bricks and mortar), then that fault is one which became apparent during the progress of the work.\nThat the fact of substantial leakages, whatever the cause, was known to the owners before they accepted the work and paid the balance of the contract price, is made abundantly plain by the language of the letter, Exhibit 25. There is no finding by the trial judge that the architect did not know of the faulty materials or workmanship or that the circumstances were such that knowledge is not to be imputed to him. The trial judge dealt with the ascertainment of the cause of the leakages and so doing misdirected himself on the essential point on that branch of the case, which was the appearance rather than the cause of the trouble. A new building that is leaking throughout plainly indicates either bad workmanship or materials, on the one hand, or faulty design and inadequate specifications, on the other hand. Article 16 confines the contractor\u2019s responsibility to the former, and the date of the appearance thereof becomes of great importance. The case against the contractor has not really been dealt with from that point of view.\nThe precise scope of the letter, Exhibit 25, is really a question of fact, and, when the words which appear in the letter, \u201ccertain defects\u201d and \u201cwater leaking into the church,\u201d are interpreted by reference to the circumstances under which the letter was delivered and accepted, it may well be that the undertaking covered by the letter had the effect of superseding, to the extent of the matters covered by the letter, the obligation of the contractor imposed by article 16; and as the action against the contractor is based entirely upon the claim for damages resulting from the leakages throughout the church, that would in itself be an end to the claim. In view of our conclusion to grant a new trial on the issues arising out of article 16, we refrain from further discussion of the meaning and effect of Exhibit 25 in this connection, as this aspect of the case will, no doubt, be fully developed on the rehearing.\nBut in any event the action was one for damages, and if there was liability upon the contractor under article 16, it rested upon the plaintiffs to establish upon a proper measure of damages what were in fact the actual damages. No such attempt was made in this case. The two expert witnesses of the plaintiffs at the trial never saw the building until January, 1934. Harrington admitted in cross-examination that time had its effect on the conditions as he saw them; that the defects would have been more easily dealt with in the spring of 1932; and that each application of frost unquestionably made the condition of the joints and bondings worse. Lothian, the architect, agreed with the statement in the Sheppard report that Blonde reported having flooded the roof about September, 1931, with the drains blocked, for a period of three hours, with no visible sign of leakage. Neither Macdonald nor Harrington, the two expert witnesses upon whose evidence the trial judge fixed the amount of damages, attempted to estimate the cost of making the repairs except at the date they were giving their evidence, February, 1934\u2014two and a half years after the completion of the building. The cost of reconstruction at that date was not the measure of damages, but even if it were their evidence as to the amount of damages was entirely unsatisfactory. Harrington in examination in chief was asked\nNow then, from your observations, and having regard to your experience in these matters, what would you estimate as the cost of making what you consider the necessary repairs to remedy so far as possible the conditions of which you have spoken?\nAns. I would not hazard making any estimate.\nPressed further by counsel, he said,\nI would not attempt to make an estimate of that,\nand then proceeded to give some figures which\nI would think * * * would be necessary to put that work to some extent back to what it was intended to be originally. * * *\nand gives as his explanation for not being able to make an estimate of costs, that you have\nto have something before you in the form of drawings or specifications from which you get your quantities and judge the amount of work.\nCross-examined on the figures he gave, he said, I have made a few calculations here which I would not care to class as an estimate, but a guess.\nMacdonald, when asked his opinion of the cost of making repairs to the conditions as he found them, said,\nI must make the same statement as Mr. Harrington as regards that * * *\nThat was the evidence upon which the trial judge based his assessment of damages. The principle of measuring damages on the basis of the cost of reconstruction of the building as it stood at the date of the trial, was clearly wrong, quite apart from the very unsatisfactory nature of the evidence adduced even on that basis. Lothian, the architect, under cross\u2011examination, after describing the conditions of the mortar and brick, gave this evidence:\nQ. These conditions are the result of an examination in October?\nA. Early in 1932.\nQ. The attack from within had been made when?\nA. Sometime late in 1931.\nQ. If the investigation had been made before the final certificate was issued, it would have revealed the conditions we find now?\nA. Yes, sir.\nIbbetson, a building contractor called by the plaintiffs, who had been employed by the plaintiffs to make repairs in the fall of 1932 and \u201ca little work\u201d the following spring, was asked why he did not go on and make what he considered the necessary repairs and alterations at the time. His answer was,\nThe main reason was the lack of funds available for the work\non the part of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff Doe, when asked by his own counsel why Ibbetson was not instructed to proceed and remedy the whole situation that appeared when Ibbetson was there, said,\nApproaching winter would render his work imperfect. He had other work to do. I arranged with him to return the next year to finish the work.\nQ. Anything else?\nA. Yes, finances. I do not wish to mention that, though.\nWhen Ibbetson was asked by the trial judge what would be the total cost of putting the building in proper repair, he answered,\nI would ask to be excused from saying that.\nMr. Justice Riddell in the Court of Appeal said he was wholly unable from the evidence to say whether any liability had been incurred under article 16, and we entirely agree with that statement. He concluded that if the plaintiffs so desired, they should be allowed to have a new trial on that issue alone. Now after the whole matter has been heard again on appeal to this Court, it would be most unfortunate for all parties if there had to be a new trial. But what can we do? The evidence was never really directed to the vital issue. When a trial for any reason becomes abortive it is a privilege and the duty of the court to come to the assistance of the parties to prevent the defeat of rights that may actually exist (to adapt the words of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Cameron v. Cuddy[2]. We cannot, however, in this case supply the defects that have occurred, and we can only hope that the parties may be able to agree upon a settlement of their differences. If not, the appeal of the contractor should be allowed and the judgment against him set aside, with liberty to the plaintiffs, if so advised, to proceed to a new trial on the issue arising out of article 16. There should be no costs of the first trial to either party, but the contractor should have his costs of his appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of his appeal to this Court. The costs of the new trial as well as of the action to be in the discretion of the trial judge.\nNow as to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal against the surety company. Article 25 of the General Conditions of the contract, under the heading \u201cApplication for Payments,\u201d expressly provided that the contractor should submit to the architect an application for each payment with receipts and vouchers showing payments made for materials and labour, including payments to sub-contractors as required by article 23. The plaintiffs paid the contractor on December 3, 1930, the sum of $4,000; on January 10, 1931, $5,000; on February 6, 1931, $12,000; on March 6, 1931, $10,000, and on April 8, 1931, $12,500 (a total of $43,500); and there is no evidence that the contractor submitted any application as contemplated by article 25 for any of these payments. The evidence does not disclose any progress application or estimate having been made until April 30, 1931. By a statement of that date the contractor showed $65,528 had been spent on materials and labour up to that date on a total contract of $88,500. As early as March it had become so evident that the building would not be completed within the specified time under the contract that the plaintiffs instructed the architect to write to the surety company call- ing its attention to the condition of affairs due to the unnecessary delays, but the architect did not do so. The plaintiffs kept paying moneys to the contractor. On May 8, 1931, they made a further payment of $12,500 and on June 3, 1931, another sum of $12,000, bringing the total payments then up to $68,000, with the work far from completion, although the date fixed by the contract for completion had been May 15. The evidence discloses that the work had been dragging on in an unsatisfactory manner for several months, and yet the contractor was allowed to go on with the work and the surety company was in no way notified of the really serious conditions that had developed. On June 2, 1931, the surety company wrote the architect that it was desirous of ascertaining what progress had been made with the work and asking for answers to specific questions on a form which the surety company supplied, which form called for a statement of the percentage of the work completed to that date, the amount retained by the owners on the contract, the amount of money paid on the contract, whether any extras had been allowed and whether any unusual conditions had been encountered. No answer was given to the enquiry.\nDuring the month of June the situation became more serious. The time for completion of the contract had expired, the contractor was without funds to carry on the work, he was heavily indebted to his bank, and the subcontractors and material men were pressing for payment. Meetings of sub-contractors were being held, and it was a question as to whether some kind of adjustment could be made between the contractor and his creditors or whether liens would be registered against the property. The whole situation had become acute but nothing was said to the surety company. Their requests for information were ignored until July 15, 1931, when the architect reported to the surety company that 98% of the work had been completed, that the owners were retaining $14,869, that they had paid to the contractor $74,250 and that the extras allowed to date were $619. In answer to the question of the surety, \u201cHave any unusual conditions been encountered?\u201d the architect wrote in the word \u201cNo\u201d and then apparently drew his pen through it, and when asked the probable date of completion, he fixed it at August 1, 1931. Three days before giving this information to the surety company the architect had notified the contractor that unless progress was made immediately on the work the owners would, at the expiration of 72 hours, call in another contractor to complete the roofing work so as to avoid further damage. At that time it appears that the claims of the sub-contractors amounted to about $20,000 and that they had declined to do any more work. By the end of July the workmen had left the job and the sub-contractors had put their claims in the hands of one Roach, as trustee to whom they had assigned their accounts, and it was subsequently arranged between the plaintiffs, the contractor, the Royal Bank and Roach that the balance remaining unpaid under the contract, $14,990.33, should be paid direct to Roach for the sub\u2011contractors. It would appear from the evidence of the witness Marcott that all work ceased on the church on July 31, 1931, except that the contractor and one or two of his workmen went there on one or two occasions to try to rectify the leaks. In any event the architect\u2019s final certificate was dated August 13, 1931. But trouble in regard to the walls and roofing still continued and the plaintiffs were pressing the contractor to take steps to remedy the situation. He was declining to do so, pointing out that in his opinion the difficulties were not due to faulty workmanship but to faulty design. Then, on September 28, 1931, the settlement of the matter between the plaintiffs and the contractor took place, which was covered by the letter (Exhibit 25), and the plaintiffs paid the balance remaining unpaid under the contract direct to Roach, with the consent of the contractor, and the moneys were distributed among the sub-contractors. The undertaking of the contractor (Exhibit 25) operated to discharge the original contract, save and except any obligations that might arise under article 16 thereof, and a new and independent obligation upon the contractor came into being.\nIn Holland-Canada Mortgage Co. Ltd. v. Hutchings[3], we had occasion recently to consider and discuss the authorities on the effect of alterations or changes in the contract as affecting the liability of the surety. It is desirable to again state the principles with particular reference to the type of contract with which we are now dealing, the performance of which the surety guaranteed.\nIn Holme v. Brunskill[4], Cotton, L.J., said:\nThe cases as to discharge of a surety by an agreement made by the creditor, to give time to the principal debtor, are only an exemplification of the rule stated by Lord Loughborough in the case of Rees v. Berrington[5]: \u201cIt is the clearest and most evident equity not to carry on any transaction without the knowledge of him [the surety], who must necessarily have a concern in every transaction with the principal debtor. You cannot keep him bound and transact his affairs (for they are as much his as your own) without consulting him.\u201d\nThe true rule in my opinion is, that if there is any agreement between the principals with reference to the contract guaranteed, the surety ought to be consulted, and that if he has not consented to the alteration, although in cases where it is without inquiry evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or that it cannot be otherwise than beneficial to the surety, the surety may not be discharged; yet, that if it is not self-evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or one which cannot be prejudicial to the surety, the Court will not, in an action against the surety, go into an inquiry as to the effect of the alteration, or allow the question, whether the surety is discharged or not, to be determined by the finding of a jury as to the materiality of the alteration or on the question whether it is to the prejudice of the surety, but will hold that in such a case the surety himself must be the sole judge whether or not he will consent to remain liable notwithstanding the alteration, and that if he has not so consented he will be discharged. This is in accordance with what is stated to be the law by Amphlett, L.J., in the Croydon Gas Company v. Dickenson[6].\nMateriality of any change or alteration in the contract is not a question of fact for the court\u2014it is for the surety to judge\u2014except in those cases where it can plainly be seen without inquiry that the change or alteration was unsubstantial or necessarily beneficial to the surety.\nIn Blest v. Brown[7], Lord Westbury said:\nIt must always be recollected in what manner a surety is bound. You bind him to the letter of his engagement. Beyond the proper interpretation of that engagement you have no hold upon him. He receives no benefit and no consideration. He is bound, therefore, merely according to the proper meaning and effect of the written engagement that he has entered into. If that written engagement is altered in a single line, no matter whether it be altered for his benefit, no matter whether the alteration be innocently made, he has a right to say, \u201cThe contract is no longer that for which I engaged to be surety; you have put an end to the contract that I guaranteed, and my obligation, therefore, is at an end.\u201d\nIn Miller v. Stewart[8] it was remarked by Mr. Justice Story that it matters not that a surety may sustain no injury by a change in the contract, or that it may even be for his benefit. He has a right to stand upon the very terms of his contract; and if he does not assent to any variation of it, and a variation is made, it is fatal.\nThere is to be read into that general statement the qualification set out in Holme v. Brunskill[9] that where it is self-evident that the alteration or change was necessarily beneficial to the surety or utterly unsubstantial, the surety is not to be thereby discharged.\nCalvert v. The London Dock Company[10] was a building contract case. The contractor, named Streather, undertook to perform certain works for The London Dock Company and it was agreed that three-fourths of the work as finished should be paid for every two months, and the remaining one-fourth upon the completion of the whole work. It was held that the sureties for the due performance of the contract were released from their liability, by reason of payments exceeding three-fourths of the work done, having, without the consent of the sureties, been made to the contractor before the completion of the whole work. Lord Langdale said:\nThe defendants do not dispute the fact that their advances to Streather exceeded the sums which they were bound to advance under the contract, but they say, that the increased advances were made for the purpose of giving Streather greater facility to perform the contract. It is said that the performance of the work by Streather was impeded by his want of funds; and that by the advances made to him, he was enabled to do more, than he otherwise could have done\u2014and that to assist him, was to assist his sureties; and it was only for the purposes of affording that assistance, that the company did more than they were obliged to do.\nThe argument, however, that the advances beyond the stipulations of the contract, were calculated to be beneficial to the sureties, can be of no avail. In almost every case where the surety has been released, either in consequence of time being given to the principal debtor, or of a compromise being made with him, it has been contended, that what was done was beneficial to the surety\u2014and the answer has always been, that the surety himself was the proper judge of that\u2014and that no arrangement, different from that contained in his contract, is to be forced upon him; and bearing in mind that the surety, if he pays the debt, ought to have the benefit of all the securities possessed by the creditor, the question always is, whether what has been done lessens that security.\nIn this case, the company were to pay for three-fourths of the work done every two months; the remaining one-fourth, was to remain unpaid for, till the whole was completed; and the effect of this stipulation was, at the same time, to urge Streather to perform the work, and to leave in the hands of the company a fund wherewith to complete the work, if he did not; and thus it materially tended to protect the sureties. What the company did, was perhaps calculated to make it easier for Streather to complete the work, if he acted with prudence and good faith; but it also took away that particular sort of pressure, which by the contract, was intended to be applied to him. And the company, instead of keeping themselves in the situation of debtors, having in their hands one-fourth of the value of the work done, became creditors to a large amount, without any security; and under the circumstances, I think, that their situation with respect to Streather, was so far altered, that the sureties must be considered to be discharged from their suretyship.\nMuch of the same sort of argument was presented to us in this case\u2014that the payments made facilitated the contractor in performing the contract and that what assisted the contractor was really a benefit to the surety. That argument, however, Lord Langdale said, could be of no avail in a case such as this.\nIn The General Steam Navigation Co. v. Rolt[11], A. contracted with B. to build for him a ship for a given sum to be paid by instalments as the work reached certain stages and C. became surety for the due performance of the contract on the part of B., the builder. A. allowed B. to anticipate the greater portion of the last two instalments, and, B. becoming bankrupt before the ship was finished, A. was compelled to spend a larger sum of money than the unpaid portion of the purchase money in completing her. Willes, J., at p. 599, said:\nAs to the first point, Mr. Knowles says, that, as the \u00a32,000 was paid to Mr. Rolt or to his account, he sustained no prejudice from its being an anticipatory payment. But I must confess I do not see how the receipt of the money from Mare, or by means of Mare\u2019s order, in satisfaction of a debt due to him from Mare, can establish that proposition. A case of Samuell v. Howarth[12] was cited on the former argument (ante, p. 574), which is a decision of Lord Eldon\u2019s very much in point. His Lordship there says: \u201cA creditor has no right,\u2014it is against the faith of his contract,\u2014to give time to the principal, even though manifestly for the benefit of the surety, without the consent of the surety.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that there must be an assent by the surety to the creditor\u2019s dealing with the principal debtor otherwise than in the manner pointed out by the contract: and it is no answer to say that it is for the advantage of the surety, or that he has sustained no prejudice. Here, there was an unauthorized payment of \u00a32,000 to Mare; and, as this payment was made without Rolt\u2019s assent, that, according to Samuell v. Howarth12, was such a prejudice to him as surety as to discharge him.\nWhile that was a case of the giving of time, the same principle would apply to the unauthorized payments that were made in the case before us. Further, in the General Steam Navigation Company case11 it was contended that if the surety had inquired he would have found that the instal- ments had been all paid more than two months before and, as he abstained from inquiry, he must in equity be presumed to have knowledge of, and consequently to have assented to, the payment. As to this Willes, J., said at p. 600:\nBut no authority has been cited which goes that length: and the doctrine of constructive assent is not one which ought to be admitted, certainly not one which a court of law ought to extend. No case has been cited to shew that any such duty to inquire is imposed on a surety.\nThe real point in that case was that it was necessary to prove knowledge of the payments by the surety, and the judgment of Willes, J., practically negatived constructive notice. To the same effect were the judgments of Cockburn, C.J., and Crowder, J. The case went on appeal to the Exchequer Chamber and was heard by a powerful court composed of Lord Chief Baron Pollock, Wightman, J., Channell, B., Hill, J., and Blackburn, J. The appeal was dismissed.\nNow it is to be observed that the anticipatory payments, the absence of the architect from the work during a critical stage of construction and the absence of the contractor himself through illness, the dealing with the sub-contractors and the payment of the total balance of the contract price to them, and the taking of the specific undertaking in writing (Exhibit 25) from the contractor as a condition to the payment of the balance of the contract price\u2014were all positive acts done or sanctioned by the principal without notice to or knowledge of any of these acts by the surety. They cannot be said to be evidence of mere passive inactivity or of acts which by their very nature were so insignificant as to have no bearing on the surety\u2019s liability. It seems very plain that the plaintiffs should have brought in the surety and explained the whole matter to it and any arrangement or adjustments that were to be made, either with the sub-contractors or with the contractor himself leading to a final acceptance of the work and the payment of the balance of the contract moneys, should have been made, under all the special circumstances of the case, with the knowledge and consent of the surety. It cannot fairly be said that it is self-evident that these positive acts of the principal in dealing with the contract were not to the prejudice of the surety, and in the absence of any notice or knowledge on the part of the surety these acts operated to discharge the surety. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the action against the surety on these grounds, and the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from that judgment to this Court should be dismissed with costs.\nWe would not care to be taken to have overlooked the very serious point raised at the trial by counsel for the surety company and renewed in the Court of Appeal and again in this Court, that the surety company was, in any event, entitled to be released upon the ground that before entering into its bond of indemnity in favour of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had knowledge of facts and circumstances materially affecting the position of him, the performance of whose contract the surety company proposed to guarantee to the extent of $44,250, and failed to disclose these facts to the surety company. The contractor put in his bid on the proposed building at $88,500. There were nine or ten other bidders, the next lowest to him was $10,000 in excess of his bid, and the other bids ran up as high as $130,000. The bid of the defendant contractor was immediately accepted and a contract was drawn up and signed at once. He had deposited a cheque for $4,450 with his bid, and, immediately the bid was accepted, he commenced putting substantial materials on the ground with which to proceed with the construction of the building. Within three or four days, he notified the plaintiffs that he had made two substantial omissions in estimating costs for the purpose of putting in his bid. He told them that he had entirely overlooked the glass for the windows and the labour of installing the glass which he said would cost him $6,000, and that he had entirely overlooked the cost of the tile, $7,000. He asked under the circumstances either to be released from his contract or to be given some increased amount to compensate him for these items. The plaintiffs declined to do either, telling him that if he threw up his contract he would not only lose his deposit of $4,450 but all the materials that he had delivered to the site of the proposed building. Faced with that alternative, he decided to go on and do the best he could. Even the architect on his own figuring at that time estimated the profit of the contractor on the contract figure would be only $637. Now the plaintiffs had in their hands at that time a bond from the surety company which contained special terms and conditions for the protection of the surety in a building con- tract of this kind. The plaintiffs, with the knowledge that they had acquired of the substantial errors on the part of the contractor in making up his bid, subsequently returned the bond to the surety company, refusing to accept it in that form and insisting upon a blanket form of bond. The surety company acceded to this request and delivered the bond upon which this action was brought. All this evidence was brought out by counsel for the plaintiffs in their examination of their own witnesses. There was no suggestion that the plaintiffs ever told the surety company anything about all this, and counsel for the surety company, when the facts had come out at the trial, very properly asked leave to expressly plead this non-disclosure. Counsel for the plaintiffs said they were taken by surprise by the proposed amendment and even in this Court suggested that they might have been able to prove that the surety company knew of the contractor\u2019s errors if the trial had been adjourned. It is difficult to conceive that any surety company carrying on a commercial business would have issued its bond for $44,250 (half the amount of the contract price) if it had even a suspicion that the contractor in his haste in making up his bid had overlooked items of cost aggregating $13,000. The trial had proceeded for a week before this matter came up, and the trial judge refused leave to the surety company to plead this non-disclosure except upon terms that the trial should stand adjourned and that the surety company should pay in any event all the costs of the trial up to that time. Counsel for the surety company very properly took the position that he was entitled upon the special circumstances to raise by amendment the defence of non-disclosure and that he could not submit his clients to such a burdensome term of costs as imposed. We should have thought, under all the circumstances, that there was not the slightest doubt of the right of the surety company to amend its pleadings without being fettered by a term as to costs so onerous as to be plainly unreasonable. If counsel for the plaintiffs had persisted in their position at the trial that they were taken by surprise and might be able to meet the proposed amendment if delay were granted, the case might appropriately have been adjourned for a convenient time, with costs reserved. If that course had been adopted, we suspect the action against the surety would have come to an end. Rowlatt on Principal and Surety, 3rd ed. (1936), p. 161, says that A creditor must reveal to the surety every fact which under the circumstances the surety would expect not to exist; for the omission to mention that such a fact does exist is an implied misrepresentation that it does not.\nAs Lord Blackburn (then Blackburn J.) put it in Lee v. Jones[13], it is a question of fact whether in the circumstances you ought to disclose and whether the non-disclosure amounts to misrepresentation\u2014that is, with intent to mislead. The question we have to ask ourselves, as a question of fact, is: would persons in the position of the plaintiffs acting in good faith and with common sense, have thought the surety would enter into a qualified bond (i.e., without the protection afforded by the special provisions of the first bond tendered) if the surety had known of the contractor\u2019s substantial mistakes in calculating his costs, his request to withdraw from the contract, the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal of his request and their virtual enforcement of the contract under threat of forfeiture of both the deposit moneys and the materials on the ground? If the surety had known all this, would it have given such a bond as it did?\nWorkington Harbour & Dock Board v. Trade Indemnity Company[14] is a very recent case in the House of Lords. In delivering judgment Lord Atkin said that the case had to be decided on the footing that the contract sued on was a guarantee and that it is clear that in whatever way any duty to disclose arises, the duty or the implied representation will depend upon the particular circumstances of each transaction, and he made it plain that it had been unnecessary to pass any opinion on the general law as to disclosure in respect of guarantees and that the case was decided upon its own facts. Here we have communications passing between the creditor and the surety with reference to the formation of the guarantee contract, and nothing that is said by Lord Atkin in the Workington case14 determines the point raised in this case. But if that issue had to be determined in this case, there would have to be a new trial, because that issue has not yet been specifically pleaded or tried. It is unnecessary, however, to send the action back for a new trial on this issue, because, upon the other grounds above mentioned, we have concluded that the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the action against the surety should be affirmed and the appeal therefrom should be dismissed with costs.\nRINFRET, J. (dissenting in part).\u2014The appellant Blonde undertook to erect a church building in Windsor, Ontario, for the Corporation of the Diocese of London; and the Canadian Surety Company gave its bond to the latter, guaranteeing the performance of the contract.\nThe building was found by the trial judge to have been completed on August 13, 1931.\nOn the ground that the contractor had failed faithfully to perform his contract, this action was brought by the plaintiffs against the contractor and the Surety Company, claiming damages in the sum of $44,695.15.\nThe trial judge gave judgment against both defendants in the sum of $19,173.25 and an additional sum of $330 against the contractor.\nIn the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the judgment against the Surety Company was set aside, but the majority of the Court was of opinion that the judgment against the contractor should be affirmed.\nIn this Court, the plaintiffs appealed against the judgment dismissing the action so far as the Surety Company was concerned; and the contractor again appealed from the concurrent judgments against him.\nThe trial judge made the following findings of fact:\n* * * that the specifications requiring the construction of the wall with the brick and tile thoroughly bonded throughout with mortar were not complied with by the contractor\u2014the joints between the bricks themselves having been improperly and insufficiently filled with mortar and there being a very general absence of mortar fill between the brick and tile save for what was squeezed in as the brick was laid. * * * that this failure to comply with the specifications for the construction of the wall resulted in an opening up of the bonding between the bricks and mortar and was to a very large degree responsible for the leaking which caused so much damage and may ultimately seriously impair the safety of the building. * * * that the flashing around the clerestory and other windows was not in accordance with specifications and that the lead coping was not applied in compliance therewith. * * * that the cracks found in the building were not the result of vibration caused by the brick work being improperly tied into the steel frame.\nHe added:\nOn the fullest consideration of the evidence, I find as a fact that there was such non\u2011compliance with the specifications and such faulty performance of the contract as would entitle the plaintiffs to damages. He further found:\n* * * as a fact, that the architect did exercise ample supervision throughout the construction as might be expected from a supervising architect, and that he did from time to time object to and reject certain work, but that he could not have been expected to have suspected the failure of the defendant Blonde to comply with the specifications in the brick work until weather conditions would reveal the same, or unless he had from time to time torn down work which from its external appearance did not disclose its inward deficiency.\nIn the Court of Appeal, these findings were not disturbed, and the majority of the Court found that there was\nno adequate reason for interfering with the judgment of the trial judge as against the defendant Blonde.\nThe contract (article 16 of the specifications) provided that, notwithstanding the issue of the final certificate or the payment of the balance due under it and notwithstanding any provision of the contract document, the contractor shall not be relieved from \u201cresponsibility for faulty materials or workmanship, which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of completion of the work.\u201d The contractor was bound to \u201cremedy any defect due thereto and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom which shall appear within such period of one year.\u201d\nThe trial judge found \u201cas a fact that the defects claimed by the plaintiffs did arise within one year from the 13th of August, 1931.\u201d\nAt the hearing in this Court, the appellant Blonde laid stress on the point that the above finding was contrary to the evidence and that the trial judge had misdirected himself as to the true interpretation of the specifications in that regard, because the defects which the trial judge found to have existed had really \u201cappeared\u201d before the final payment was made, and consequently, it was claimed by the contractor, they were not discovered \u201cwithin a period of one year from the date of completion of the work,\u201d but they had really become apparent previous to that time; and they were not, therefore, within the contemplation of Article 16 of the specifications. It is true that, before the issue of the final certificate and before the final payment to the contractor, it had been discovered that there was water leaking into the building; but the cause of the leaking had not yet been ascertained. It was only subsequently that it was found out that the real cause was a defect in construc- tion properly attributable to the faulty workmanship of the contractor. And, in that respect, I think the finding of fact of the trial judge is fully warranted on the evidence.\nBut, in my view, that point has ceased to have any bearing on the case, on account of the document signed by the contractor on September 28, 1931, before the final payment was made, not to the contractor himself, but to certain subcontractors and material men, in order to help the contractor. Under that document (recited in full in my learned brothers\u2019 judgments), the contractor acknowledged having received notice that certain defects had been discovered by the architect and that the cause of these defects had \u201cnot been exactly determined.\u201d He further acknowledged that the said notice had been given to him \u201cin pursuance of the specifications which form part of the contract entered into between\u201d himself and the Corporation of the Diocese of London. And he further agreed and covenanted \u201cto repair same according to the directions given by the architect, Mr. Lothian.\u201d\nIn my humble view, this undertaking created a new and independent obligation upon the contractor, no longer qualified by the restrictions contained in Article 16 of the specifications, and which, therefore, made it incumbent upon him to repair the defects, whether they appeared or not \u201cwithin a period of one year from the date of completion of the work.\u201d As for the directions to be given by the architect, I am in agreement with Masten, J.A., in the Court of Appeal, both as to the interpretation he gives to those terms in the letter of September 28, 1931, and as to the fact that \u201csuch directions were given directly by the architect and also indirectly by him, through the solicitors who were acting as the agents of the Plaintiff and the architect.\u201d\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal of the contractor Blonde from the concurrent judgments of the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHowever, for the same reasons: viewing, as I do, the document of September 28, 1931, as a material alteration in the contract between the Corporation of the Diocese of London and Blonde, I think the respondent, the Canadian Surety Company, was thereby released of its liability under the bond, and I would dismiss the appeal against it and affirm the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Ontario with costs.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which, reversing the trial judge, dismissed the appellants\u2019 action as against the defendant Surety Company; and a cross-appeal by the defendant contractor, Blonde, from the same judgment, which affirmed the judgment at the trial against him in favour of the appellants.\nThe action was brought by the appellants, as owners, for damages, against the contractor for the erection of a church in Windsor, Ontario, under the terms of a contract dated November 8th, 1930, and against the Surety Company under the terms of a bond dated November 15th, 1930, in the sum of $44,250, conditioned upon the company indemnifying the Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of London (one of the appellants) against any loss or damage directly arising by reason of the failure of the contractor faithfully to perform the said contract.\nSo far as the cross-appeal by the contractor is concerned, the learned trial judge has dealt exhaustively with the voluminous evidence, and, after reading all of the evidence, I can see no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial judge and of the majority of the members of the Court of Appeal. Realizing that he had concurrent findings against him, the cross\u2011appellant (the contractor Blonde) sought to escape liability by pointing to a document dated September 28th, 1931, which the appellants required Blonde to sign before the cheque for the final payment under the contract was delivered. This document, Exhibit 25, is as follows:\nThe Reverend E.G. Doe,\nand The Roman Catholic\nEpiscopal Corporation\nof the Diocese of London.\nI hereby acknowledge having received notice from you and your architect, Mr. Lothian, to the effect that certain defects have been discovered by your architect, and that there is water leaking into the church constructed by me, the cause of which has not been exactly determined.\nI hereby acknowledge having received notice from your architect and from you of same. I hereby acknowledge that the said notice has been given to me in pursuance of the specifications which form part of the contract entered into between you and myself. I further agree and covenant to repair same according to the directions given by your architect, Mr. Lothian.\nDated at Windsor, Ontario, this 28th day of September, A.D. 1931.\nThe argument on Blonde\u2019s behalf is that no directions were given by the architect Lothian subsequent to the execution of this document and that, therefore, he, Blonde, was not in default. For two reasons I am of opinion that this contention cannot prevail. First, the leaks arose, as the trial judge found (and I agree), from Blonde\u2019s failure to use sufficient mortar in the construction of the brick and tile walls and in the space between these walls and thus neglected to comply with the specifications. Second, on February 1st, 1932, the solicitors for the appellants wrote Blonde:\nRe\u2014St. Clare Church\nWe have been in communication with Mr. Lothian, the architect for St. Clare church, and have discussed the matter with him relative to the leaks which have occurred in many places, particularly around the clerestory windows on the side walls, on the east and west naves near the corners, at a point about five feet below the ceiling, and also at one point about six feet above the floor, on the ceiling of the Baptistery, beneath the window on the west side of the Sanctuary, and over the east Confessional. Mr. Lothian is of the opinion that all of these matters can be remedied, and that same are within the province of the specifications, and should be attended to immediately. Under the guarantee called for in the specifications, you are held responsible for this work for a period of one year from final acceptance of the same, and we are now calling on you to carry out this work within seventy-two hours from this date.\nMr. Lothian is of the opinion also that a good many of the leaks are due to flashings not properly embedded in the brickwork, others through the improper joining of the flashings, still others through brickwork wrongly constructed, and further, between the frames of the clerestory windows and the walls.\nBlonde replied on February 8th, 1932\nReceived your letter dated Feb. 1st, re leaks in the St. Clare church. I have spent to date about $450 trying to repair the leaks in the clerestory brick work and around the windows. I have come to this point where I refused to do any more work on this roof constructed of brick. I have the opinion of other architect and bricklayers and I have been told and believe that the leaks can not be repaired.\nAll the repaired work has been done according to Mr. Lothian instruction to no results.\nThese letters by themselves indicate that Blonde was notified and that he had endeavoured to some extent to remedy the condition and then refused to do anything further.\nIt was also contended on Blonde\u2019s behalf that the opinion of the experts, called as witnesses by the appellants and upon whose evidence the trial judge based his assessment of damages, was founded upon conditions as these witnesses saw them shortly before the commencement of the trial. However, it appears from the evidence of the architect that those conditions were substantially unchanged as compared with conditions that existed within a year after the completion of the building. On page 88 of the case appear the following questions and answers when the architect was being examined in chief.\nQ. Have you recently made an inspection of the church?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Have you or have you not a general knowledge of the extent of the work that has been done by Mr. Ibbetson in the attempt to make repairs?\nA. Yes, I have a general knowledge.\nQ. With the exception of the work which you understand to have been done by Mr. Ibbetson in the way of reconstruction what do you say as to the condition of the remainder of the church and rectory as compared with its condition within a year after the completion of the building?\nA. Substantially unchanged, so far as I could see.\nMr. Ibbetson was the contractor subsequently engaged by the appellants to do certain repair work, and a comparison of that part of his evidence dealing with the conditions which he found at the time he did the repair work with the evidence of the experts as to the conditions they found, shows that the defects complained of had arisen within the year. In my opinion there is ample justification for the amount fixed as damages by the trial judge and the cross\u2011appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Riddell considered that the Surety Company was released by reason of the appellants having the contractor sign the letter of September 28th, 1931. Mr. Justice Masten was of opinion that the appeal to that Court by the Surety Company should be allowed. Mr. Justice Fisher dissented, being of opinion that the judgment of the trial judge was right on all grounds. The main contention of the Surety Company in support of the judgment in appeal was that the letter of September 28th, 1931, was a material alteration in the contract between the appellants and the contractor.\nIn my opinion this document did not effect any change in the contract. By the contract Blonde agreed to \u201ccomplete in all its entirety all works\u201d for the erection of the church with certain specified exceptions, \u201cin the most sound, workmanlike and substantial manner, and in accordance with the plans, drawings, specifications and addenda to the specifications, and with such further drawings, details and instructions as may from time to time be given\u201d by the architect.\nPrevious to the execution by Blonde of this letter, leaks had developed and certain repair work done. The architect was not satisfied that these leaks would not reappear and new ones be not discovered. He considered that flashings should be installed, while Blonde contended they were not specified. Article 16 of the specifications provides:\nNeither the final certificate or payment, nor any provision of the contract document shall relieve the contractor from responsibility for faulty materials or workmanship, which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of completion of the work, and he shall remedy any defect due thereto and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom which shall appear within such period of one year, but beyond that the contractor shall not be liable. The owner shall give notice of observed defects with reasonable promptness. Questions arising under this article shall be decided as provided in Articles 10 and 44.\nArticle 10, referred to is as follows:\nThe architect shall within a reasonable time make decision on all claims of the owner or contractor, and on all other matters relating to the execution and progress of the work or the interpretation of the contract documents.\nThe architect\u2019s decision in matters relating to artistic effect shall be final, if within the terms of the contract documents.\nArticle 44 referred to in Article 16 deals with the arbitration of disputes under the contract.\nAccordingly we have this position at that time. The architect was not satisfied that the cause of the leaks had been located and the proper remedy applied, and as an added precaution he insisted on Exhibit 25 being signed. Under Article 16 of the specifications, the contractor was responsible for faulty materials or workmanship that might appear within one year from the completion of the work, which work was, according to the terms of the contract quoted above, to be done in accordance with the plans, drawings, etc., and such \u201cinstructions as may from time to time be given\u201d by the architect. Under Exhibit 25, he was not subjected to anything more onerous, there was no change in the contract, and consequently the Surety Company is not released.\nThe next argument to be dealt with is based upon the alleged mistake of Blonde in omitting to estimate the cost of certain work and materials in the tender he submitted, and which was the tender finally accepted. It is doubtful if the point is open to the Surety Company, as an application by it for an amendment to its pleadings to cover this feature was granted by the trial judge after the trial had been in progress for some time, but on terms, and these terms were declined by counsel for the Surety Company who stated he would proceed without the amendment.\nHowever, assuming the pleadings are sufficient without amendment, I am unable to ascertain how the alleged mistake affects the matter. Blonde\u2019s tender exceeded the architect\u2019s estimate of the cost of the work, and while the appellants knew of Blonde\u2019s contention, there was no obligation on them to notify the Surety Company of the alleged error. Fraud or misrepresentation is not charged and there is no suggestion that it occurred to the plaintiffs or the architect acting for them to withhold the information as something of which the Surety Company should be apprised.\nIn Railton v. Matthews[15], a party became surety in a bond for the fidelity of a commission agent to his employers without having been informed that the agent had previously, while in partnership with another, misapplied the employers\u2019 funds while the partnership was acting as agents for the employers. It was held that the direction to the jury by the trial judge that the concealment by the employers of the previous defalcations to be undue must be wilful and intentional with a view to the advantages the employers were thereby to gain, was wrong in law and that mere non-communication of circumstances affecting the situation of the parties, material for the surety to be acquainted with and within the knowledge of the person obtaining a surety bond, is undue concealment, though not wilful or intentional or with a view to any advantage to himself.\nHowever, in Hamilton v. Watson[16] it was held that an obligation to a banker by a third party to be responsible for a cash credit to be given to one of the banker\u2019s customers is not avoided by the fact that at the time the obligation was signed the customer was indebted to the bank, nor by the fact that, immediately after the execution of the obligation, the cash credit was employed to pay off an old debt due to the banker.\nIn London General Omnibus Company Limited v. Holloway[17], following Railton v. Matthews15, it was decided that the non-disclosure by an employer to a proposed surety on behalf of a servant that the latter had previously been guilty of dishonesty in his employment, prevented the employer from enforcing the bond against the surety in respect of the servant\u2019s subsequent dishonesty, although such non-disclosure was not fraudulent.\nIn my opinion the effect of these and other relevant cases is correctly set forth in Rowlatt on Principal and Surety, 2nd Ed., in two paragraphs at pp. 157 and 158 respectively.\nA surety is not bound by his contract if it was induced by any misrepresentation by the creditor, whether fraudulently made or not, of any fact known to him and material to be known to the surety.\nMisrepresentation may, of course, be made by mere silence or concealment. This may vitiate a security without it being wilful and intentional or made with a view to advantage to be gained by the creditor. But a guarantee is not an insurance, and there is no obligation on the creditor to disclose to the surety every circumstance within his knowledge material for the surety to know.\nIn my view, the contention of the Surety Company at present under consideration fails.\nThe architect was away for about five weeks, leaving an assistant in charge. The evidence of all witnesses who testified on the subject is to the effect that the architect devoted as much time to this work as is customary.\nShortly after the architect\u2019s return, the contractor became ill but he had a foreman on the work who had been with him for a considerable time. In my opinion, the company\u2019s contention that these matters,\u2014the absence of the architect and the illness of the contractor\u2014should have been brought to its attention, is without substance, as is also its complaint that it was not notified of certain letters sent by the architect to the contractor referring to delays in the prosecution of the work.\nBlonde did have financial difficulties; the bank appropriated one payment made by the appellants and as a result Blonde was unable to pay the sub-contractors and material men. Under an arrangement made between these people and Blonde the last payment was made not to the contractor, but to a solicitor who had been appointed for that purpose by these parties so as to prevent any action by the creditors. The architect endeavoured to assist the contractor in doing certain work after the date for completion had passed, but no agreement was made extending the period allowed to Blonde to fulfil his contract. Here again, complaint is made that the Surety Company-should have been notified. But on what principle? A company such as this, undertaking the business of supplying bonds for a premium, is entitled to certain rights under the law, but to be kept advised of everything that transpires in connection with the bonded work is not one of them. I cannot find that there was any alteration in the terms of the contract, nor can I find, after reading all the evidence in the case, that the Surety Company was prejudiced in the slightest degree.\nBecause of the view I have taken of the facts, Rees v. Berrington[18], Holme v. Brunskill[19], Egbert v. National Crown Bank[20], Smith v. Wood[21], and the many other cases cited, have no application. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal of the plaintiffs dismissed with costs.\nAppeal of the defendant Blonde allowed with costs and the judgment against him set aside, with liberty to plaintiffs to proceed to a new trial against him on the issue arising out of article 16 of the contract.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs (appellants): A.

Cannon J., through illness, took no part in the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Damages for infringement\u2014Matters and items of damages\u2014Sale of product of infringing machine\u2014Invention for manufacturing stringers to be used in fasteners\u2014Loss caused from sales of completed articles (fasteners) made from stringers made on infringing machines\u2014Damages for loss of profit on sales lost\u2014Damages by way of royalty\u2014Damages for loss from reduction in sale price\u2014Pleadings\u2014Raising question of right under s. 47 (6) of Patent Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 150) on assessment of damages after judgment, when facts relied on not pleaded and proved in the action for infringement.\nThe sale of the product of an infringing machine is not too remote upon which to found a claim in damages, under s. 32 of the Patent Act (R.S.C. 1927, c 150), by the owner of the patent of the machine infringed.\nThe object of the patented\u2019 invention was to manufacture stringers to be used in fasteners.\nHeld: Plaintiff (owner of the patent) could not be properly compensated for infringement by reference only to the manufacturer\u2019s cost and sale price of the stringers and without regard to the cost and sale price of the completed articles (fasteners); the stringers were of importance only in their use in fasteners and what plaintiff lost was sales of fasteners; the principle set forth in Meters Ld. v. Metropolitan Gas Meters Ld., 28 R.P.C. 157, should be applied; plaintiff was entitled to damages for loss sustained by reason of defendant\u2019s sales of fasteners from stringers made on infringing machines.\nHeld, further: On the evidence (and applying the \u201cbroad axe\u201d referred to by Lord Shaw in Watson v. Pott, 3.1 R.P.C. 104), had defendant not sold such fasteners, plaintiff would have sold 60 per cent. of the number actually sold by defendant; and plaintiff was entitled by way of damages to the profit it would have made on what it would have sold as aforesaid. It was so entitled, even were it shown that in the period of infringement it did not manufacture stringers on its patented machine; it was deprived of the opportunity of using its patented machine to produce stringers for the said 60 per cent. As to the 40 per cent. of defendant\u2019s sales which plaintiff would not have made, plaintiff was entitled to damages by way of royalty (Watson v. Pott, 31 R.P.C. 104, at 120; United Horse Shoe & Nail Co. v. Stewart, 5 R.P.C. 260, at 267). Damages were awarded also for loss to plaintiff by reason of reduction by defendant in the sale price of such fasteners (forcing reduction by plaintiff) (American Braided Wire Co. v. Thomson, 7 R.P.C. 152); but not where plaintiff was the first to act, even were plaintiff induced to act by its representatives having been told, falsely, by prospective or actual customers that they could purchase more cheaply from defendant\u2014a claim for damages in such a case was too remote.\nIn the interval between lapse of plaintiff\u2019s patent for non-payment of fees and publication of notice of application to restore it, defendant shipped into Canada fasteners (not taken into account in plaintiff\u2019s statement of damages) made in the United States on machines identical with machines held to constitute infringement of the patent. On an assessment of damages, after judgment had been given for plaintiff in an action for infringement, defendant claimed that by virtue of the operation of s. 47 (6) of the Patent Act, it obtained the right to use the invention in Canada. Held, that the facts should have been pleaded and proved in the patent action as a defence, and it was now too late to raise the question on the assessment of damages.\nAPPEAL by the defendants, and cross-appeal by the plaintiff, from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], confirming, subject to a certain reduction in the amount of damages, the report of the Registrar of that Court[2] as to the damages which the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants by reason of infringement of patent.\nThe action was for damages and other relief for alleged infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, which was for machines and methods for producing straight and curved fastener stringers. By the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Maclean J.[3]), it was adjudged that the plaintiff\u2019s letters patent were valid, and infringed by the defendants; and (besides injunction, etc.) a reference was directed to the Registrar of the Court as to the damages recoverable by reason of the infringements, or as to the profits made by the defendants by reason of the infringements, as the plaintiff might elect before the Registrar. (The plaintiff subsequently elected to take damages.) This judgment was reversed by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada[4]; but was restored by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[5], subject to a variation that the declaration of validity made and the injunction and other relief granted be limited to certain claims. By the report of the Registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada as to damages[6], he recommended that judgment be rendered for the plaintiff in the sum of $50,663.26. The report of the Registrar was confirmed by the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[7], subject to the variation that the amount of damages which the plaintiff should recover be reduced by the sum of $3,117.56 allowed by the Registrar as damage due to forced reduction in plaintiff\u2019s selling price.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada; and the plaintiff cross-appealed (against said disallowance of $3,117.56, and for increased damages).\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, the defendants\u2019 appeal was dismissed with costs; the cross-appeal was allowed to the extent of the said sum of $3,117.56, also with costs; the order of the President of the Exchequer Court in respect of the costs of the reference and of the costs of the appeals to him to stand.\nS. A. Hayden K.C. and James Woods Walker for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. (Cannon J., through illness, took no part in the judgment) was delivered by\nKerwin, J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants and cross-appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Exchequer Court (2) which, with one deduction, affirmed the report of the Registrar of that Court as to the damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the defendants\u2019 infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 19 of the plaintiff\u2019s patent of invention. By an order of His Majesty in Council, approving the report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the original judgment of the Exchequer Court in this action (which had been reversed in this Court) was restored, subject to the variation that the declaration of validity made and injunction and other relief granted were limited to these claims.\nThe patent was for a new and useful improvement in a machine and method for producing fastener stringers. Claim 1 may be taken as representative of the machine claims held valid and is as follows:\nA machine for making fasteners having means for feeding a tape step by step, means for feeding fastener members into position to be compressed on to said tape, and means for compressing the fastener members thereon.\nClaim 19, dealing with the method, reads:\n19. The method of making fasteners consisting in affixing jaw members in spaced groups on a continuous stringer in predetermined number and spacing, and cutting the stringer so that pairs of said groups co-operate in forming a fastener.\nWhile the terminology used is not always exact throughout, it will be noted that the patent was granted for a machine and method for making fastener stringers. A fastener stringer consists of a row (of predetermined length) of metal elements fastened to the edge of a tape. Later the tape is cut between each row, two rows are connected by a sliding member, top and bottom stops are attached, and the other edge of each of the two lengths of tape is sewn to each side of an opening which is desired to be closed. The completed article is known as a fastener and its commercial importance lies in the uses to which it may be adapted. The patent is not on the fastener.\nOne of the defendants, G. E. Prentice Manufacturing Company, is a manufacturer of fasteners in the United States of America. It made stringers for some of these fasteners on machines of the type held in this action to be an infringement, and in 1927 commenced shipping its product to Canada. In 1930 it shipped to Canada three infringing machines and leased them to its co-defendant, Colonial Fastener Company, Limited. Since then the Prentice Company has continued to ship fasteners into Canada, but in greatly reduced quantities, and the Colonial Company has manufactured fastener stringers on the infringing machines leased by them from the Prentice Company and for which they paid the latter a rental, and a royalty based upon the sale of the total number of fasteners in which were incorporated the fastener stringers so made. No claim is made in this action against the Prentice Company in connection with any stringers that may have been made on similar machines in the United States and used in fasteners shipped by it into Canada.\nAfter securing particulars of the number and output of the three infringing machines, the plaintiff elected to claim damages. The plaintiff has its head office at St. Catharines, Ontario, and has been manufacturing and selling fasteners since 1925. It claims that every sale by defendants of a completed fastener, the stringers for which had been made on the infringing machines, meant a loss to it for which it is entitled to compensation, while the defendants contend:\n(\u0430) That by the law of Canada the sale of the product of an infringing machine is not a wrongful act and that it is too remote upon which to found a claim in damages;\n(b) That even if that be not so, the stringers are the only product and that the sale price of the completed fasteners should not be considered;\n(c) That in any event the plaintiff, in fact, would not have sold all the fasteners that the defendants did and, in law, is not entitled to claim damages for any proportion of the defendants\u2019 sales.\nIt appears convenient to dispose now of (a) and (b), leaving (c) for consideration later.\n(a) Admittedly the law in England is quite clear that the sale of the product of an infringing machine entitles the owner of the patent to damages for such sale. United Horse Shoe and Nail Co. v. Stewart[8]. But it is urged that in England the Patent Act does not define the extent of the patent monopoly or the acts constituting infringement: that these continue according to the common law and that by the grant, \u201cOur subjects\u201d are commanded \u201cthat they do not at any time during the continuance of the said term of fourteen years either directly or indirectly make use of or put in practice the said invention, or any part of the same.\u201d Emphasis is placed on the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d and it is pointed out that they do not appear in section 32 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 150. Section 32 is as follows:\n32. Every person who, without the consent in writing of the patentee, makes, constructs or puts in practice any invention for which a patent has been obtained\u2019 under this Act or any previous Act, or who procureis such invention from any person not authorized by the patentee or his legal representatives to make or use it, and who uses it, shall be liable to the patentee or his legal representatives in an action of damages for so doing; and the judgment shall be enforced, and the damages and costs that are adjudged shall be recoverable, in like manner as in other cases in the court in which the action is brought. I cannot find any difference in meaning between that wording and the phraseology of the English form of grant. If the damages claimed are not too remote, the wrongdoers must, as in every case of tort, compensate the injured party for such damages as he may have suffered. In my view the sale of the product of an infringing machine is not too remote.\nCollette v. Lasnier[9], cited by counsel for the defendants, has no application. In that case there was no allegation or proof that the plaintiff suffered any loss or damage. He claimed baldly that defendants had realized a profit over and above the profits that would have been made without using the patented machine and demanded that extra profit as his damages. The Superior Court of Quebec granted the plaintiff as damages what the Court deemed to be the amount of such extra profit and the Court of Appeal affirmed that award. In this Court the lack of evidence of any loss or damage suffered by the plaintiff was pointed out, but rather than send the case back for a new assessment, the Court fixed the sum of one hundred dollars as the amount which the plaintiff should recover. This decision is not contrary to the views I have expressed.\n(b) As to this branch of the defendants\u2019 contention, it suffices to remark that when one bears in mind that the object of the patentee\u2019s invention was, as expressed in his claims and specifications, to manufacture stringers to be used in fasteners, the plaintiff could not properly be compensated by reference only to the manufacturer\u2019s cost and sale price of stringers and without regard to the cost and sale price of the completed article. As has been pointed out previously, the stringers are of importance only in their use in fasteners and what the plaintiff lost was sales of fasteners. The principle set forth in Meters Ld. v. Metropolitan Gas Meters Ld.[10] should be applied. There the Court of Appeal had to consider the amount of damages the plaintiff was entitled to where the defendant infringed plaintiff\u2019s patents, one of which related to a particular kind of cam and spindle for opening the gas valve in a prepayment gas meter, and the other of which was for a particular kind of crown wheel in a like meter. It had been shewn before the Master and Eve J., to whom an appeal had been taken, that the plaintiff would have sold many more meters but for the defendant\u2019s intervention, and it was, therefore, awarded 13s. 4d. for the loss of profit on each of such meters. The Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment and made it clear that they agreed with the Master and with Eve J. that the proper method of assessing the damages was to take the profit on the sale price of the meters and not merely to consider the parts upon which the plaintiff held patents. Adopting this principle, the defendants\u2019 contention fails.\nOne other general defence raised by the defendant G. E. Prentice Manufacturing Company may be mentioned. The patent had been allowed to lapse for non-payment of fees on April 5th, 1927, and notice of the application to restore it was not published until June 11th of the same year. During the interval the defendant G. E. Prentice Manufacturing Company shipped into Canada fasteners made in the United States on machines identical with the machines held to constitute infringements of the patent. That defendant continued to make similar shipments from time to time, and it was urged that by virtue of the operation of subs. 6 of s. 47 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 150, the Company obtained the right to use the invention in Canada. Subsection 6 is as follows:\n6. In any case where a patent which has become void is restored and revived as aforesaid and during the period when such patent was void and before publication of notice of hearing on an application for its restoration and revival as aforesaid, any person has commenced lawfully to construct, manufacture, use or sell in Canada the invention covered by such patent, such person may continue to construct, manufacture, use or sell such invention in as full and ample a manner as if such patent had not been restored and revived.\nNone of the fasteners included in any of these shipments so made by the Company from the United States were taken into account in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of damages. Without dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s submission that this defendant cannot rely on the manufacture in the United States as giving it the right to manufacture in Canada, I agree with the Registrar and President of the Exchequer Court that the facts should have been pleaded and proved in the patent action as a defence, and that it is now too late to raise the question on the assessment of damages.\nBefore referring to the items in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of damages, it should be mentioned that included therein is a claim for loss in connection with stringers made by defendants on two machines, or as they are called in the statement, \u201cdivided machines\u201d; that is, instead of all the operations required to produce a stringer being on one machine the operations were divided between two machines. However, it is clear that what the Privy Council held the defendants had infringed was \u201cthe general mechanical idea of combining in this class of work all the necessary operations in one machine\u201d[11], and not a method carried out by two machines. The plaintiff points to Claim 19 and to the following remarks of Lord Tomlin[12]:\nThere remains for consideration Claim 19. This is a method claim. It is said to be anticipated by Aaronson\u2019s Patent; but, even if the method is limited to fixing members on to stringers, the claim is for something which had never been done before, namely, producing stringers fitted with identical members so that a pair of stringers can co-operate to form a complete fastener. Their Lordships think that this is a novel claim with ample subject-matter and is valid and has been infringed.\nBut this language must not be divorced from the remainder of the judgment. This shows that the monopoly the plaintiff secured was on a machine of the type indicated; with means for producing the results mentioned,\u2014but always on one machine11. Read thus, Lord Tomlin\u2019s remarks as to Claim 19 are clear and unambiguous and the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal on this branch of the case fails.\nOmitting all reference to the \u201cdivided machines\u201d and the figures relating thereto used by the plaintiff in its statement, this summary so far as pertinent to the case at bar would now appear as follows:\n(1) Loss due to sales made by defendant of fasteners made in Canada on machines calculated on the price actually obtained by the plaintiff........................................................\n$87,593 72\n(2) Loss due to first cut in minimum price calculated on defendant\u2019s sales.................................................................\n15,161 32\n(3) Loss due to second cut in minimum price calculated on defendant\u2019s sales.................................................................\n5,042 44\n(4) Loss due to elimination of 5c. flat charge calculated on fasteners over 7\u00bd\u201d lengths sold by defendant.............................................................................\n1,210 50\n(5) Loss due to first cut in minimum price calculated on plaintiff\u2019s actual sales of fasteners up to 7\u00bd\u201d.......................................................................................\n26,632 55\n(6) Loss due to second reduction of minimum price calculated on plaintiff\u2019s actual sales of fasteners up to 7\u00bd\u201d..................\n4,636 54\n(7) Loss due to elimination of 5c. per piece on plaintiff\u2019s actual sales of fasteners over 7\u00bd\u201d.................................................\n4,081 95 Item 1. The defendants admitted making and selling 742,901 fasteners from stringers made on infringing machines. I have already pointed out that the plaintiff is entitled to damages for any loss it sustained by reason of these sales. The first problem is to determine whether the plaintiff would have made all these sales and even a cursory examination of the evidence would indicate that this is clearly a case where the broad axe referred to by Lord Shaw in Watson v. Pott[13] should be applied. I have read all the evidence and, without attempting to analyse it, which the Registrar has done with great ability and in detail, I cannot find that he omitted to take into consideration all proper elements and I agree with his conclusion, affirmed by the President, that the plaintiff would have sold sixty per cent. of the total number. It is contended that in the period during which infringement is shown the plaintiff did not manufacture stringers on its patented machine, but even if that were taken as proved, it does not operate in ease of the defendants. The plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity of using its patented machine to produce stringers for the 445,740 fasteners (i.e., 60 per cent. of 742,901), and, as I conclude it would have sold that number, it is entitled by way of damages to that profit on the sale of each of such fasteners that the evidence discloses. This disposes of defendants\u2019 contention (c) referred to above.\nThe Registrar found the plaintiff\u2019s loss of profit to be 10 cents per fastener. Not only did the defendants appeal, alleging that there was no basis upon which the allowance could be justified, but the plaintiff cross-appealed, alleging in turn that its calculation of its loss of profit was 11.79 cents per fastener; that the Registrar had found no fault with the correctness of its figures, and that the President, beyond adopting the Registrar\u2019s figure, had made no reference to the point. Even if the mathematical accuracy of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of costs of manufacture be admitted, one must not lose sight of the contents of the plaintiff\u2019s letter to the Minister of Finance and of the methods of manufacture actually in use by it when its costs were compiled. These consideration\u2019s serve to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s figures but at the same time leave them as a basis of computation. I might have adopted another figure, one probably a little lower in view of the matters mentioned, but I cannot say that there is sufficient to warrant interference with the Registrar\u2019s estimate, and the appeal and cross-appeal on this branch are dismissed.\nAs to the forty per cent. of the defendants\u2019 sales which the plaintiff would not have made, it is still entitled to damages by way of royalty. As Lord Watson points out in United Horse Shoe and Nail Company v. Stewart[14], \u201cEvery sale of goods manufactured, without licence, by patent machinery, is and must be treated as an illegal transaction in a question with the patentee.\u201d In Watson v. Pott[15], Lord Shaw said:\nIf with regard to the general trade which was done, or would have been done by the respondents within their ordinary range of trade, damages be assessed, these ought, of course, to enter the account and to stand. But in addition there remains that class of business which the respondents would not have done; and in such cases it appears to me that the correct and full measure is only reached by adding that a patentee is also entitled, on the principle of price or hire, to a royalty for the unauthorized sale or use of every one of the infringing machines in a market which the infringer, if left to himself, might not have reached. Otherwise, that property which consists in the monopoly of the patented articles granted to the patentee has been invaded, and indeed abstracted, and the law, when appealed to, would be standing by and allowing the invader or abstractor to go free. In such cases a royalty is an excellent key to unlock the difficulty, and I am in entire accord with the principle laid down by Lord Moulton in Meters Ltd. v. Metropolitan Gas Meters Ld.[16]. Each of the infringements was an actionable wrong, and although it may have been committed in a range of business or of territory which the patentee might not have reached, he is entitled to hire or royalty in respect of each unauthorized use of his property. Otherwise, the remedy might fall unjustly short of the wrong.\nUnder this subdivision the plaintiff has been allowed a royalty of 1 cent per fastener, i.e., 1 cent \u00d7 40 per cent. of 742,901 or a total of $2;971.60. Both parties have appealed as to this allowance, the plaintiff contending that it should be at least 2.3 cents per fastener, and the defendants contending that it was overly generous to the plaintiff. I agree that the Registrar was correct in disregarding, on the one hand, the evidence that a departmental store had paid a royalty of 5 cents, as the fasteners there had been used on rather expensive articles; and in disregarding, on the other hand, the evidence of Mr. Prentice that in the United States he had granted licences and had been offered licences at the rate of 2\/3 cent per fastener, as the purchasing power of the public is much greater in the United States than in Canada. The main contention on the part of the plaintiff is that the Registrar in that part of his report which appears at the top of p. 754 of the Appeal Case before this Court, erred in stating that the Colonial Fastener Company, Limited, had paid its co-defendant, G. E. Prentice Manufacturing Company, Limited, a royalty of $12,737.02 on 742,901 fastener stringers. It would appear that the Registrar did err in that respect. It is undoubted that a royalty was paid, and, according to the evidence, it was fifteen per cent. of the gross sales price for the greater part of the time and ten per cent. for the remainder; but these percentages were of the gross sale price of the completed fasteners and not merely of fastener stringers.\nAppendix I to the plaintiff\u2019s factum shows, with references to the pages where the evidence is to be found, that the total sum received from the sale of the fastener stringers, as mentioned by the Registrar, $84,030.50, is practically correct. This figure is obtained from Appendix I by adding to the total under Column 3 under the heading \u201cUnitary Machines\u201d the sum of $5,557.21, which appears opposite Period VI in the third column under the heading \u201cDivided Machines.\u201d Although nothing is being allowed in connection with the product of these \u201cdivided machines,\u201d in this instance it is necessary to accept the plaintiff\u2019s calculations with reference to Period VI in order to arrive at the Registrar\u2019s total. In any event this does not prejudice either party. References are also given under column 5 in Appendix I to the evidence which indicates the amount of royalty paid according to defendants\u2019 own figures and this shows a total of $17,194.33 or $18,746.78, depending upon whether the total figures for Period VI are separated or kept intact. Adopting the former the rate of royalty per fastener would figure out to about 2\u00b73 cents and not 1\u00be cents, which the Registrar\u2019s calculation showed. It is suggested that, having estimated the royalty paid by the Colonial Company to the Prentice Company at 1\u00be cents per fastener, the Registrar unconsciously allowed this figure to be a guide to his final estimate that a fair royalty for the defendants to pay the plaintiff would be 1 cent per fastener. However, it must be remembered that, for the rental and royalty received by it from its co-defendant, the Prentice Company gave certain other services; and that while patentees may endeavour to impose all that the traffic will bear, in the instant case, the plaintiff, if it had adopted a system of licensing by demanding a royalty on each fastener, would have been obliged to set a figure in proportion to the sale price of a completed fastener. The rate adopted is one I would have accepted if the matter had come before me in the first instance.\nIn the result, therefore, the allowance of $47,545.70 under Item I in the plaintiff\u2019s statement remains undisturbed.\nThe remaining items deal with alleged damages due to reductions at different times by the defendants in the sale price of fasteners. Such a claim, if made out, is valid. American Braided Wire Co. v. Thomson[17]. The evidence, however, fully warrants the finding that, in connection with the first reduction, the plaintiff was the first to act. It is then contended that, granting this to be so, the plaintiff was induced to such a course by reason of its representatives having been told, falsely, by prospective or actual customers that they could purchase more cheaply from the defendants. This claim, however, is too remote and Items 2 and 5 must be disregarded.\nThe second reduction was first made by defendants and, as damages under the headings in plaintiff\u2019s statement referring thereto, the Registrar allowed the sum of $3,117.56. The President disallowed this, as he considered that no \u201csafe deduction can be made, in this case, from the fact that the defendants at any time sold their product at prices below that of the plaintiff, and which compelled the plaintiff to meet the reduction.\u201d After anxious consideration I have concluded that the plaintiff is entitled to something under this heading,\u2014and not merely a nominal sum. After making every allowance for the effect of competition from imported fasteners, it must be admitted that any domestic manufacturer was in a privileged position to fill quickly the requirements of customers. It is true that there was a third concern in Canada producing fasteners, but the Registrar has allowed for this and I think I cannot do better than quote his remarks:\nOn the whole, the United Carr Manufacturing Co. being in the same locality as plaintiff and the importations being lower in price, I have decided to divide the total losses to plaintiff in the ratio of 25 per cent; 37\u00bd per cent and 37\u00bd per cent, and would charge the defendants with 25 per cent of the losses.\nNow the figures involved are those numbered 3, 4, 6 and 7 on pages 3 and 4 hereof, namely,\n(3) $5042\u00b744; (4) $1210\u00b750\u20146252\u00b794 and\n(6) $4636\u00b754; (7) $4081\u00b795\u2014$8718\u00b749.\nThese must be divided into two; first, the losses based on defendant\u2019s sales, namely, Nos. 3 and 4, $6252\u00b794; and second, those based on plaintiff\u2019s own sales, namely, Nos. 6 and 7, $8718\u00b749, for the following reason:\nIn reference to losses from forced reductions based on defendant\u2019s sales the 25 per cent thereof to be charged against defendant must be taken on 60 per cent of the said sales, because it is only on 60 per cent of defendant\u2019s sales that plaintiff is entitled to get loss of profit; as on 40 per cent it is to be paid a royalty which\u2019 is not affected by the reduction in prices. Now 60 per cent of $6252\u00b794 is $3751\u00b776 and 25 per cent of $3751\u00b776 is $937\u00b794, for which defendant is responsible regarding its own sales, and 25 per cent of $8718\u00b749 is $2179\u00b762 re plaintiff\u2019s sales, making a total of $3117\u00b756 which I find plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants as damages resulting from the said forced reduction in price.\nI believe that the Registrar has correctly appreciated the evidence and has properly applied the relevant principles. I do not say that I would have necessarily divided the total losses to the plaintiff in the same proportions, but on the whole I think the sum allowed is fair and reasonable under all the circumstances and that it should stand. The plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal in this connection should be allowed.\nThere remains for determination one claim not included in the itemized statement. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel described this as \u201cthe loss sustained by reason of the disturbance of the market consequent upon the defendants\u2019 intervention,\u201d and argued that in addition to the substantial sums claimed in the itemized statement, the plaintiff should receive a further large amount. The plaintiff company at the outset adopted a restrictive sales policy. It considered that in order to induce manufacturers of articles to which the fasteners might be attached, to experiment with something that was new and untried, a campaign of education and persuasion had first to be undertaken together with the offer of a special inducement. That inducement was that the plaintiff would supply only certain manufacturers with fasteners to be applied to specified purposes. In this way it was considered that the Company would be able to persuade some manufacturers not merely to try the new experiment but also to push the sales of their own product, which, of course, would result in additional sales of fasteners. It was argued that the effect of the defendants\u2019 intervention was to disrupt this scheme and that the plaintiff found it necessary to follow the defendants\u2019 example and sell to any manufacturer. However, the fact must not be lost sight of that there was no patent on fasteners and that stringers for them could be made in different ways. Besides the defendants\u2019 competition there was considerable importation from other countries and I am satisfied upon the evidence that without the defendants\u2019 intervention the plaintiff would not have been able to continue the policy it adopted at the outset. One of its own witnesses stated that the policy was deemed to be a satisfactory one at the outset, while two independent witnesses called by the defendants considered that the policy was not workable at any time. The plaintiff has been allowed all the damages to which it is fairly entitled in order to place it in the position it would have occupied if defendants had not infringed. There is nothing upon which to base any such claim as is here advanced and the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal on this point fails.\nThe net result is that the appeal is dismissed in toto and the cross-appeal allowed to the extent of $3,117.56. The Registrar recommended that the plaintiff be allowed the costs of the reference since it was entitled to damages and the defendants had contested each claim. That recommendation is adopted. Before the President the defendants succeeded in reducing the amount allowed by $3,117.56; the plaintiff failed to secure any higher amount, and no order was made as to the costs of the appeals to the President. The plaintiff was obliged to appeal from that judgment in order to recover its position before the Registrar, and the appeal to this Court should, therefore, be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal (to the extent indicated) allowed with costs. But, in view of the many matters on which the plaintiff failed, the President\u2019s order as to the costs of the appeals to him might well stand.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal (to the extent indicated) allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Harold G.

The present appellant was mortgagee of the building and of the land on which it stood, and loss under the policies was made payable to it as its interest might appear.\nStatutory condition 6 provided that:\nThe insurer will make good loss or damage caused by lightning or by the explosion of coal or natural gas in a building not forming part of gasworks, whether fire ensues therefrom or not; and loss or damage by fire caused by any other explosion; * * *\nAn explosion or explosions had occurred on the occasion of the fire. As between the present appellant and the defendant the main questions in dispute had to do with facts concerning the cause or causes of the destruction of the building and the amount recoverable under the policies, having regard to those facts and the statutory condition above quoted.\nThe trial judge, Graham J., after discussing the evidence, stated as follows:\nI cannot find affirmatively that the explosions were coal gas explosions; I find the cause of the explosions not proven. So far, however, as this conclusion is concerned I have no advantage from having heard and seen the witnesses. I think that a fire which preceded and caused the first explosion or a fire caused by the first explosion, which was a minor one, and therefore did little or no damage probably caused the second explosion, which followed the first after the lapse of an appreciable time\u2014a second or two\u2014and which wrecked the building. That being the situation, the damage (both that caused by fire or by the second explosion) resulted from a fire ignited before, or by, the first explosion, which fire during its continuance (in the second event though brief, it was for an appreciable time) caused the second explosion * * * and he held that, therefore, the present appellant was entitled to judgment for its full claim[2]. (He dismissed the claim of the other plaintiffs with regard to the loss of the building, on a finding as to a certain statement in the proof of loss; an appeal from his decision on this question was dismissed by the Court in banco; and no appeal was brought thereon to this Court).\nThe defendant\u2019s appeal from the said judgment of Graham J. in favour of the present appellant was allowed by the Court in banco[3], which rescinded and set aside the said judgment and held that the present appellant was only entitled to recover from the defendant the damage or loss caused by fire after the collapse of the building, and directed a reference as to the amount of such damage or loss by fire. The reasons of the Court in banco were delivered by Chisholm C.J., who, after referring to the trial judge\u2019s findings, stated that the question of fact which was important was \u201cwhether the fire preceded the explosion or the explosion the fire,\u201d and, after discussing the evidence, held that it was not \u201csufficiently persuasive to shew that a fire preceded the explosion\u201d; and that \u201cthe plaintiffs have failed to prove their whole case\u201d; and that what was recoverable was the damage caused after the collapse; to fix which damage there should be a reference.\nOn the appeal of the Mortgage Corporation of Nova Scotia to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing the argument of counsel for the appellant, the Court (on the following day), without calling on counsel for the respondent, gave judgment orally, dismissing the appeal with costs. The Chief Justice stated that the members of the Court had had an opportunity of considering over-night the very able and comprehensive argument of counsel for the appellant, and, after very carefully examining the evidence, they had come to the conclusion that there was no ground upon which the Court could properly reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nGeorge E.
